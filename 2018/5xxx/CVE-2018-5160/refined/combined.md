# USN-3645-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

11 May 2018

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application

crash, bypass same-origin restrictions, conduct cross-site scripting (XSS)

attacks, install lightweight themes without user interaction, spoof the

filename in the downloads panel, or execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-5150](/security/CVE-2018-5150), [CVE-2018-5151](/security/CVE-2018-5151), [CVE-2018-5153](/security/CVE-2018-5153), [CVE-2018-5154](/security/CVE-2018-5154),

[CVE-2018-5155](/security/CVE-2018-5155), [CVE-2018-5157](/security/CVE-2018-5157), [CVE-2018-5158](/security/CVE-2018-5158), [CVE-2018-5159](/security/CVE-2018-5159), [CVE-2018-5160](/security/CVE-2018-5160),

[CVE-2018-5163](/security/CVE-2018-5163), [CVE-2018-5164](/security/CVE-2018-5164), [CVE-2018-5168](/security/CVE-2018-5168), [CVE-2018-5173](/security/CVE-2018-5173), [CVE-2018-5175](/security/CVE-2018-5175),

[CVE-2018-5177](/security/CVE-2018-5177), [CVE-2018-5180](/security/CVE-2018-5180))

Multiple security issues were discovered with WebExtensions. If a user

were tricked in to installing a specially crafted extension, an attacker

could potentially exploit these to obtain sensitive information, or bypass

security restrictions. ([CVE-2018-5152](/security/CVE-2018-5152), [CVE-2018-5166](/security/CVE-2018-5166))

It was discovered that the web console and JavaScript debugger incorrectly

linkified chrome: and javascript URLs. If a user were tricked in to

clicking a specially crafted link, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. ([CVE-2018-5167](/security/CVE-2018-5167))

It was discovered that dragging and dropping link text on to the home

button could set the home page to include chrome pages. If a user were

tricked in to dragging and dropping a specially crafted link on to the

home button, an attacker could potentially exploit this bypass security

restrictions. ([CVE-2018-5169](/security/CVE-2018-5169))

It was discovered that the Live Bookmarks page and PDF viewer would run

script pasted from the clipboard. If a user were tricked in to copying and

pasting specially crafted text, an attacker could potentially exploit this

to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. ([CVE-2018-5172](/security/CVE-2018-5172))

It was discovered that the JSON viewer incorrectly linkified javascript:

URLs. If a user were tricked in to clicking on a specially crafted link,

an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information. ([CVE-2018-5176](/security/CVE-2018-5176))

It was discovered that dragging a file: URL on to a tab that is running in

a different process would cause the file to open in that process. If a

user were tricked in to dragging a file: URL, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to bypass intended security policies.

([CVE-2018-5181](/security/CVE-2018-5181))

It was discovered that dragging text that is a file: URL on to the

addressbar would open the specified file. If a user were tricked in to

dragging specially crafted text on to the addressbar, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to bypass intended security policies.

([CVE-2018-5182](/security/CVE-2018-5182))

##### References

* [Bug 1436117](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1436117)

#### [#CVE-2018-5152: WebExtensions information leak through webRequest API](#CVE-2018-5152)

Reporter
Andy McKay
Impact
moderate
##### Description

WebExtensions with the appropriate permissions can attach content scripts to Mozilla sites such as accounts.firefox.com and listen to network traffic to the site through the `webRequest` API. For example, this allows for the interception of username and an encrypted password during login to Firefox Accounts. This issue does not expose synchronization traffic directly and is limited to the process of user login to the website and the data displayed to the user once logged in.

#### [#CVE-2018-5163: Replacing cached data in JavaScript Start-up Bytecode Cache](#CVE-2018-5163)

Reporter
Nicolas B. Pierron
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If a malicious attacker has used another vulnerability to gain full control over a content process, they may be able to replace the alternate data resources stored in the JavaScript Start-up Bytecode Cache (JSBC) for other JavaScript code. If the parent process then runs this replaced code, the executed script would be run with the parent process' privileges, escaping the sandbox on content processes.

#### [#CVE-2018-5164: CSP not applied to all multipart content sent with multipart/x-mixed-replace](#CVE-2018-5164)

Reporter
Khalil Zhani
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Content Security Policy (CSP) is not applied correctly to all parts of multipart content sent with the `multipart/x-mixed-replace` MIME type. This could allow for script to run where CSP should block it, allowing for cross-site scripting (XSS) and other attacks.

##### References

* [Bug 1416045](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1416045)

#### [#CVE-2018-5166: WebExtension host permission bypass through filterReponseData](#CVE-2018-5166)

Reporter
Francois Lajeunesse Robert
Impact
moderate
##### Description

WebExtensions can use request redirection and a `filterReponseData` filter to bypass host permission settings to redirect network traffic and access content from a host for which they do not have explicit user permission.

##### References

* [Bug 1437325](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1437325)

#### [#CVE-2018-5167: Improper linkification of chrome: and javascript: content in web console and JavaScript debugger](#CVE-2018-5167)

Reporter
Wladimir Palant
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The web console and JavaScript debugger do not sanitize all output that can be hyperlinked. Both will display `chrome:` links as active, clickable hyperlinks in their output. Web sites should not be able to directly link to internal chrome pages. Additionally, the JavaScript debugger will display `javascript:` links, which users could be tricked into clicking by malicious sites.

##### References

* [Bug 1447969](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1447969)

#### [#CVE-2018-5168: Lightweight themes can be installed without user interaction](#CVE-2018-5168)

Reporter
Wladimir Palant
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Sites can bypass security checks on permissions to install lightweight themes by manipulating the `baseURI` property of the theme element. This could allow a malicious site to install a theme without user interaction which could contain offensive or embarrassing images.

##### References

* [Bug 1449548](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1449548)

#### [#CVE-2018-5169: Dragging and dropping link text onto home button can set home page to include chrome pages](#CVE-2018-5169)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If manipulated hyperlinked text with `chrome:` URL contained in it is dragged and dropped on the "home" icon, the home page can be reset to include a normally-unlinkable chrome page as one of the home page tabs.

##### References

* [Bug 1319157](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1319157)

#### [#CVE-2018-5172: Pasted script from clipboard can run in the Live Bookmarks page or PDF viewer](#CVE-2018-5172)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The Live Bookmarks page and the PDF viewer can run injected script content if a user pastes script from the clipboard into them while viewing RSS feeds or PDF files. This could allow a malicious site to socially engineer a user to copy and paste malicious script content that could then run with the context of either page but does not allow for privilege escalation.

##### References

* [Bug 1436482](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1436482)

#### [#CVE-2018-5173: File name spoofing of Downloads panel with Unicode characters](#CVE-2018-5173)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The filename appearing in the `Downloads` panel improperly renders some Unicode characters, allowing for the file name to be spoofed. This can be used to obscure the file extension of potentially executable files from user view in the panel.
*Note: the dialog to open the file will show the full, correct filename and whether it is executable or not.*

* [Bug 1438025](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1438025)

#### [#CVE-2018-5174: Windows Defender SmartScreen UI runs with less secure behavior for downloaded files in Windows 10 April 2018 Update](#CVE-2018-5174)

Reporter
Jimmy
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In the Windows 10 April 2018 Update, Windows Defender SmartScreen honors the `SEE_MASK_FLAG_NO_UI` flag associated with downloaded files and will not show any UI. Files that are unknown and potentially dangerous will be allowed to run because SmartScreen will not prompt the user for a decision, and if the user is offline all files will be allowed to be opened because Windows won’t prompt the user to ask what to do. Firefox incorrectly sets this flag when downloading files, leading to less secure behavior from SmartScreen.
*Note: this issue only affects Windows 10 users running the April 2018 update or later. It does not affect other Windows users or other operating systems.*

#### [#CVE-2018-5175: Universal CSP bypass on sites using strict-dynamic in their policies](#CVE-2018-5175)

Reporter
Masato Kinugawa
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A mechanism to bypass Content Security Policy (CSP) protections on sites that have a `script-src` policy of `'strict-dynamic'`. If a target website contains an HTML injection flaw an attacker could inject a reference to a copy of the `require.js` library that is part of Firefox’s Developer Tools, and then use a known technique using that library to bypass the CSP restrictions on executing injected scripts.

* [Bug 1432358](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1432358)

#### [#CVE-2018-5176: JSON Viewer script injection](#CVE-2018-5176)

Reporter
Tadj Youssouf
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The JSON Viewer displays clickable hyperlinks for strings that are parseable as URLs, including `javascript:` links. If a JSON file contains malicious JavaScript script embedded as `javascript:` links, users may be tricked into clicking and running this code in the context of the JSON Viewer. This can allow for the theft of cookies and authorization tokens which are accessible to that context.

#### [#CVE-2018-5177: Buffer overflow in XSLT during number formatting](#CVE-2018-5177)

Reporter
Guyio
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A vulnerability exists in XSLT during number formatting where a negative buffer size may be allocated in some instances, leading to a buffer overflow and crash if it occurs.

* [Bug 1451908](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1451908)

#### [#CVE-2018-5165: Checkbox for enabling Flash protected mode is inverted in 32-bit Firefox](#CVE-2018-5165)

Reporter
David Parks
Impact
low
##### Description

In 32-bit versions of Firefox, the Adobe Flash plugin setting for "Enable Adobe Flash protected mode" is unchecked by default even though the Adobe Flash sandbox is actually enabled. The displayed state is the reverse of the true setting, resulting in user confusion. This could cause users to select this setting intending to activate it and inadvertently turn protections off.

##### References

* [Bug 1451452](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1451452)

#### [#CVE-2018-5180: heap-use-after-free in mozilla::WebGLContext::DrawElementsInstanced](#CVE-2018-5180)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
low
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur during WebGL operations. While this results in a potentially exploitable crash, the vulnerability is limited because the memory is freed and reused in a brief window of time during the freeing of the same callstack.

##### References

* [Bug 1444086](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1444086)

#### [#CVE-2018-5181: Local file can be displayed in noopener tab through drag and drop of hyperlink](#CVE-2018-5181)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
low
##### Description

If a URL using the `file:` protocol is dragged and dropped onto an open tab that is running in a different child process the tab will open a local file corresponding to the dropped URL, contrary to policy. One way to make the target tab open more reliably in a separate process is to open it with the `noopener` keyword.

##### References

* [Bug 1424107](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1424107)

#### [#CVE-2018-5182: Local file can be displayed from hyperlink dragged and dropped on addressbar](#CVE-2018-5182)

Reporter
Jordi Chancel
Impact
low
##### Description

If a text string that happens to be a filename in the operating system's native format is dragged and dropped onto the addressbar the specified local file will be opened. This is contrary to policy and is what would happen if the string were the equivalent `file:` URL.

##### References

* [Bug 1435908](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1435908)

#### [#CVE-2018-5179: Service workers can self update to keep a worker running](#CVE-2018-5179)

Reporter
Yannic Bonenberger
Impact
low
##### Description

A service worker can send the "activate" event on itself periodically which allows it to run perpetually. This would allow any malicious activity, such as logging an IP address by the service worker, to occur in the background.

One use of a WrappedI420Buffer in MediaPipeline [1] gets passed on further into the stack, but nothing keeps the PlanarYCbCrImage that owns the actual pixel buffer alive.
The WrappedI420Buffer outliving the PlanarYCbCrImage would be bad, but I hope and think we only end up reading that data as an image in a webrtc encoder and not doing any writing.

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]: [bug 1341285](/show_bug.cgi?id=1341285 "RESOLVED FIXED - Update WebRTC code to webrtc.org stable branch 57")
[User impact if declined]: There's a risk of the webrtc encoder accessing uninitialized memory. However we haven't seen or heard reports about this so I gather it's a very low risk.
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]: Yes, though not explicitly testing what this fix is for, as it is speculative.
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]: It's speculative, so no
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]: No
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]: None
[Is the change risky?]: No
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]: It may extend the lifetime of some internal images. The worst that could happen would be shutdown leaks.
[String changes made/needed]: None

I'd like to let this ride with 60 unless you feel strongly about fixing it in 59.

The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter

You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard

Steps to reproduce:
Hi, below is a bug report for a bug I also reported today in the Skia issue tracker (<https://bugs.chromium.org/p/skia/issues/detail?id=7674>). I assume it will be handled over there, but since this is a security issue impacting Firefox and since it is under 90-day disclosure deadline I am reporting it here as well. I also want to raise attention to the fact that Skia in Mozilla repository is at least several months behind the version in <https://cs.chromium.org> so apart from this issue you are also affected by other issues that are already fixed in the main repo.
Please let me know how you would prefer to handle issues like this in the future.
Original report follows:
\*\*\*Please note: This bug is subject to a 90 day disclosure deadline. After 90 days elapse or a patch has been made broadly available, the bug report will become visible to the public.\*\*\*
In Skia, SkTDArray stores length (fCount) and capacity (fReserve) as 32-bit ints and does not perform any integer overflow checks. There are a couple of places where an integer overflow could occur:
(1) <https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/skia/include/private/SkTDArray.h?rcl=a93a14a99816d25b773f0b12868143702baf44bf&l=369>
(2) <https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/skia/include/private/SkTDArray.h?rcl=a93a14a99816d25b773f0b12868143702baf44bf&l=382>
(3) <https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/skia/include/private/SkTDArray.h?rcl=a93a14a99816d25b773f0b12868143702baf44bf&l=383>
and possibly others
In addition, on 32-bit systems, multiplication integer overflows could occur in several places where expressions such as
fReserve \* sizeof(T)
sizeof(T) \* count
etc. are used.
An integer overflow in (2) above is especially dangerous as it will cause too little memory to be allocated to hold the array which will cause a out-of-bounds write when e.g. appending an element.
I have successfully demonstrated the issue by causing an overflow in fPts array in SkPathMeasure (<https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/skia/include/core/SkPathMeasure.h?l=104&rcl=23d97760248300b7aec213a36f8b0485857240b5>) which is used when rendering dashed paths.
The PoC requires a lot of memory (My estimate is 16+1 GB for storing the path, additional 16GB for the SkTDArray we are corrupting), however there might be less demanding paths for triggering SkTDArray integer overflows.

Attached patch

[limit allocations in SkTDArray](attachment.cgi?id=8958007&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8958007&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1441941&attachment=8958007)

This patch depends on the Skia m66 update in [bug 1444506](/show_bug.cgi?id=1444506 "RESOLVED FIXED - Update Skia to milestone 66") for the safer sk\_malloc\_thow/sk\_realloc\_throw variants which take care of the size\_t overflows. These versions will fling an error at us if the multiplication by size would overflow. All downwind cases where SkTDArray does the count \* sizeof(T) itself are guarded by this, so we'll hit the exception in the sk\_malloc routines before we ever have to deal with the consequences of the overflow now.
In the remaining cases, we need to ensure the int addition doesn't overflow. Skia doesn't currently have a convenient mechanism for this aside from manual error checks, so we have to do release asserts against the int limits to verify here.

Doesn't std::numeric\_limits<int>::max() return an int? If so, std::numeric\_limits<int>::max() \* 4 is going to overflow so the check won't work as intended.

limit allocations in SkTDArray
[Security approval request comment]
> How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
See above.
> Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
Nothing specific.
> Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All.
> Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
Requires some sk\_malloc machinery in Skia m66 update from [bug 1444506](/show_bug.cgi?id=1444506 "RESOLVED FIXED - Update Skia to milestone 66").
> How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Unlikely, just asserts instead of overflows.

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1441941&attachment=8962999)

This backports the safe sk\_malloc\_throw variants that were used in this patch so that it will work with the older Skia in 52 ESR.
[Approval Request Comment]
If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration:
User impact if declined: Sec-high exploit via canvas.
Fix Landed on Version: 61 and uplifted to 60
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): Not risky, just adding some release asserts where normally overflows might lead to crashes and other dangerous behavior.
String or UUID changes made by this patch: None

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).
