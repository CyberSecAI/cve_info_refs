Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2018-5711:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an **infinite loop** in the `gdImageCreateFromGifCtx()` function, located in `gd_gif_in.c` within the libgd library.
*   The specific cause is a **signedness confusion**, which leads to incorrect interpretation of end-of-file (EOF) conditions during GIF parsing.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Infinite Loop:** The core issue is the presence of a `do-while` loop that depends on a condition that is never met because of a type confusion. Specifically, an `unsigned char` type is used to store the result of a `GetDataBlock` call, which can return a negative value on EOF, causing the loop to continue infinitely. This makes the loop incapable of breaking upon reaching the end of GIF data.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a denial-of-service condition by supplying a specially crafted GIF file that triggers the infinite loop.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** The infinite loop consumes server resources, potentially exhausting CPU and memory.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious GIF File:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted or malicious GIF file.
*   **Application Dependent:** Exploitation depends on an application using the vulnerable `gdImageCreateFromGifCtx()` function, such as PHP's GD library.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Supply Input:** An attacker needs the ability to supply the malicious GIF file to a vulnerable application. This could be achieved through various means, including:
    *   Uploading the file to a website that processes images.
    *   Sending the file via email to a system that uses image processing.
    *   Making a crafted web request to a server processing image data.

**Technical Details and Descriptions:**

*   The `do-while` loop in `gd_gif_in.c`:
    ```c
    do {
        sd->firstcode = sd->oldcode =
          GetCode(fd, &sd->scd, sd->code_size, FALSE, ZeroDataBlockP);
    } while (sd->firstcode == sd->clear_code);
    ```
*   The `GetCode` function uses `GetDataBlock`, which returns a signed value but stores it into an `unsigned char`.
    ```c
     static int GetCode_(gdIOCtx *fd, CODE_STATIC_DATA *scd, int code_size, int flag, int *ZeroDataBlockP) {
         int           i, j, ret;
         unsigned char count;
    
         ...
           if ((count = GetDataBlock(fd, &scd->buf[2], ZeroDataBlockP)) <= 0)
                scd->done = TRUE;
         ...
     }
    ```
*   The type mismatch (signed to unsigned) causes the loop termination condition `sd->firstcode == sd->clear_code` to never be met when a negative value (EOF) is returned by `GetDataBlock`, which is then stored in the `count` variable.

**Additional Notes from the Provided Content:**

*   The vulnerability affects PHP versions prior to: 5.6.33, 7.0.27, 7.1.13, and 7.2.1.
*   Red Hat has issued security advisories (RHSA-2018:1296 and RHSA-2019:2519) to address this and other related issues in Red Hat Software Collections.
*   Ubuntu has issued a USN-3755-1 security advisory to address the issue.
*   The vulnerability was initially reported to the PHP project and has been addressed with a patch.
*   Patches have been provided for both the PHP source code and the libgd library.
*   The vulnerability is described as a "Denial of Service (DoS) via infinite loop".
*   The severity is noted as "low" in Red Hat's Bugzilla but "Moderate" in the Red Hat security advisory.

In summary, CVE-2018-5711 describes a DoS vulnerability due to a type confusion in libgd's GIF parsing logic, which can be exploited by an attacker providing a malicious GIF file to a vulnerable service. The vulnerability is relevant to PHP due to its use of libgd for image processing.
