{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The web application's license key parameter is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting due to unsafe embedding of user input into application responses. Additionally, the lack of the X-Frame-Options header makes the web interface vulnerable to Clickjacking.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS): User-supplied input to the 'license key' parameter is not sanitized and is directly embedded into the web application's response, allowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.",
       "Clickjacking: The absence of the 'X-Frame-Options' header permits the web application to be loaded within an iframe, enabling clickjacking attacks."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of the stored XSS vulnerability can lead to session hijacking, account takeover (including password changes), and execution of malicious scripts like keyloggers. Clickjacking can result in unauthorized actions being performed or confidential information being revealed through user interaction with seemingly harmless web pages.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "XSS: An attacker injects malicious JavaScript into the vulnerable 'license key' parameter. This script is then executed when any user accesses the configuration page (`get_put_config.php`).",
      "Clickjacking: An attacker loads the target web application within an iframe on a malicious page, tricking the user into performing unintended actions."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to submit data to the license key parameter of the web application to exploit the XSS vulnerability. For the clickjacking attack, the attacker needs to host a webpage with a malicious iframe pointing to the target application."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability affects IMPINJ SPEEDWAY R420 RFID READER, specifically software version 5.8.1.240. The blog post provides detailed steps and screenshots of the exploitation process. The XSS is both stored and reflected, executing two times on the same page. The vendor was notified and fixed the vulnerability in a later version."
