Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-5211

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a SQL Injection (SQLi) flaw. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `playlist` parameter when constructing SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to time-based blind SQL injection.
- Lack of Input Sanitization: User-provided input in the `playlist` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Data Breach: An attacker could potentially extract sensitive information from the database.
- Unauthorized Access: An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, allowing them to modify or delete data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET Request: The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request targeting the `ajax.php` endpoint.
- `playlist` Parameter: The malicious SQL injection payload is inserted into the `playlist` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to have network access to the target server.
- Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter: The attacker must know to target the `playlist` parameter.
- Ability to Craft Malicious SQL Payload: The attacker needs to be able to construct a valid SQL injection payload that exploits the vulnerability (time-based in this case).

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit is a time-based blind SQL injection.
- The affected page is `ajax.php`.
- The vulnerable parameter is `playlist`.
- The provided exploit payload uses `sleep(20)` to verify the presence of the SQL injection vulnerability, this allows an attacker to determine true or false statements based on response times.
