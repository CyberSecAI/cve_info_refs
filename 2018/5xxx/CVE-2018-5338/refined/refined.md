- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper permissions on the `C:\ManageEngine` directory which allows non-privileged users to escalate privileges to `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Improper file system permissions leading to privilege escalation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Non-privileged users can gain `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` level privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploiting the improperly configured permissions on the `C:\ManageEngine` directory.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a non-privileged user on the system where ManageEngine Endpoint Central is installed.
