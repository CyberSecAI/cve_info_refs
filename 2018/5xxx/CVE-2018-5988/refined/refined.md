Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization when handling the `id` parameter in `index.php` and `mobile_preview.php`. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. This allows attackers to manipulate database queries by injecting malicious SQL code through the `id` parameter.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:
    *   Access sensitive database information.
    *   Modify data within the database.
    *   Potentially gain further control of the application or server, depending on database permissions and configurations.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable PHP files (`index.php` and `mobile_preview.php`).
    *   The attacker manipulates the `id` parameter within the URL by injecting SQL code.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application.
    *   No special privileges or specific network position appear to be required. The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
