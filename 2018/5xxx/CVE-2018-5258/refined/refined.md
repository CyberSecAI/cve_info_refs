    "root_cause": "The Neon app for iOS does not properly validate X.509 certificates from SSL servers.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Missing SSL Certificate Validation",
       "Hardcoded private keys within the app",
        "Custom encryption layer using a key received from the server, encrypted with hardcoded private keys"

      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack"
