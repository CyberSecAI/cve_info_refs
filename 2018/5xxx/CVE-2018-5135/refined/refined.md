{
  "CVE-2018-5135": {
    "description": "WebExtensions can bypass normal restrictions in some circumstances and use `browser.tabs.executeScript` to inject scripts into contexts where this should not be allowed, such as pages from other WebExtensions or unprivileged `about:` pages.",
    "root_cause": "The activeTab permission in WebExtensions was not properly restricted, allowing scripts to be injected into contexts where they should have been blocked.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper access control",
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could execute arbitrary scripts in contexts that should be protected, potentially leading to privilege escalation, data theft or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious web extension leveraging `browser.tabs.executeScript` API.",
        "required_capabilities": "A user needs to install a malicious WebExtension."
