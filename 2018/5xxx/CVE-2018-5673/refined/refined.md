{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The WordPress plugin 'booking-calendar' fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, leading to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Additionally, it lacks CSRF protection, enabling Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in 'extras', 'themes', and 'forms' settings pages due to insufficient input sanitization.",
    "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) due to lack of CSRF protection."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that gets executed in the browsers of other users, including administrators, when they visit affected pages. This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other malicious activities. Additionally, CSRF allows an attacker to trick an admin into performing unintended actions.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "An attacker with low privilege access (e.g., editor role) can inject malicious scripts into the plugin settings.",
     "An attacker can craft a malicious HTML page that, when visited by an admin, submits a crafted form to modify plugin settings via CSRF."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
     "Low privilege access to the WordPress admin panel (for XSS).",
    "Ability to trick an admin user into visiting a malicious HTML page hosted by the attacker (for CSRF)."
  ]
