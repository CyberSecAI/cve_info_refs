Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Joomla! SimpleCalendar component version 3.1.9 is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization. Specifically, the `catid` parameter within the URL is not properly validated, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection vulnerability. The component fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `catid` parameter.

* **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
    * Extract sensitive data from the database.
    * Modify or delete data within the database.
    * Potentially gain unauthorized access to the system or application.

* **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests. By crafting a malicious URL with SQL injection code in the `catid` parameter, an attacker can exploit the vulnerability. The vulnerable URL parameter is `catid`.

* **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable Joomla! instance. No special privileges are required to send these requests.
