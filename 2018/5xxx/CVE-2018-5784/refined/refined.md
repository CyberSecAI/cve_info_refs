Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-5784:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an uncontrolled resource consumption within the `TIFFSetDirectory` function in `tif_dir.c`. Specifically, the declared number of directory entries in a TIFF file is not validated against the actual number of entries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `TIFFSetDirectory` function iterates through directory entries based on a declared count, without verifying if the declared count matches the actual number of directory entries present.
- Circular linked list of IFDs (Image File Directories): An attacker can craft a TIFF file where the "next IFD" offset points back to a previous IFD, creating a circular loop.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): By crafting a malicious TIFF file, an attacker can force the `TIFFSetDirectory` function to enter an infinite loop. This loop consumes excessive resources causing the application to hang or crash.
- Uncontrolled resource consumption: The loop continues until either the hardcoded limit of 65535 directories is reached. Even after this limit is hit, the processing continues, further wasting resources.
- System Hang/OOM Killer trigger: If the loop consumes too much memory, it might hang the system or trigger the operating system's OOM (Out-of-Memory) killer.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious TIFF file: An attacker crafts a TIFF file where the declared number of directories is much higher than the actual number, and the next IFD offset points to a previous IFD creating a loop.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a specially crafted TIFF file to a system or application that uses the vulnerable libtiff library. The attacker could do this by uploading the file, sending it as an email attachment, or by hosting the file on a website.
- No special privileges are required for the exploitation of the vulnerability.
