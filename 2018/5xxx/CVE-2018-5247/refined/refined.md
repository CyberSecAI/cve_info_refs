Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5247:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from incorrect handling of malformed image files by ImageMagick. Specifically, a memory leak occurs in the `ReadRLAImage` function when processing a crafted RLA image file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Leak:** The primary vulnerability is a memory leak. The provided GitHub issue shows that when `montage` is used to process a crafted `poc.rla` file, a memory leak of 8 bytes is detected in the `ReadRLAImage` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The USN (Ubuntu Security Notice) mentions that exploiting the incorrect handling of malformed image files can cause a denial of service. Repeatedly triggering the memory leak could lead to excessive memory consumption, eventually crashing the application or system.
*   **Possible Code Execution:** The USN also states that it's "possibly" able to execute code. While the provided information primarily focuses on the memory leak, the broader vulnerability associated with malformed image files can potentially be exploited for more severe impacts like arbitrary code execution. This is not directly demonstrated in the provided content but is indicated by the Ubuntu security notice.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Image File:** The attack vector involves tricking a user or automated system into opening a specially crafted image file (like the `poc.rla` file).
*   **Image Processing via `montage`:** The specific case demonstrated in the GitHub issue shows that running the `montage` command on a malicious `.rla` file can trigger the memory leak.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Malicious File:** An attacker needs the ability to provide or make the crafted image file available to the vulnerable ImageMagick application. This could be through user interaction (e.g., sending the file in an email, tricking the user to visit a malicious webpage) or automated processing (e.g., placing the file in a directory processed by a server using ImageMagick).
*   **Execution of ImageMagick:** The attacker doesn't need any special privileges. The vulnerability is triggered when a user or automated system invokes the ImageMagick program to process the malicious image.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-3681-1) groups this CVE with a large list of other vulnerabilities fixed in the same update for ImageMagick. This suggests the presence of multiple issues related to parsing and processing various image formats, any of which could potentially be exploited.
*   The specific memory leak demonstrated is in `coders/rla.c`, which indicates that the vulnerability lies in the RLA image format decoder.
*   The provided information provides more details about the specific memory leak than the generic CVE description (PLACEHOLDER).

In summary, CVE-2018-5247 in ImageMagick involves a memory leak caused by a malformed RLA image file, potentially leading to denial of service and possibly code execution, achievable by an attacker supplying a malicious image file to be processed by ImageMagick.
