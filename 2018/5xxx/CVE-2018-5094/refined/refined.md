{
  "CVE-2018-5094": {
    "Description": "A heap buffer overflow vulnerability may occur in WebAssembly when `shrinkElements` is called followed by garbage collection on memory that is now uninitialized. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability occurs due to a heap buffer overflow when garbage collection is performed on uninitialized memory after shrinking WebAssembly elements.",
    "Vulnerability": "Heap buffer overflow.",
    "Impact": "Potentially exploitable crash, leading to arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vector": "The vulnerability can be triggered by exploiting the WebAssembly API through JavaScript code.",
    "Attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious WebAssembly module and execute it in a vulnerable browser. They need to control the execution flow and data of the WebAssembly code."
