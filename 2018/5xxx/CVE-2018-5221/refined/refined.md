Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5221:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the BarcodeWiz ActiveX control. Specifically, the `BottomText` and `TopText` properties of the `BarcodeWiz.DLL` are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Buffer Overflow:** The vulnerability is triggered when excessively long strings are supplied to the `BottomText` or `TopText` properties, overwriting the buffer allocated for them.
*   **SEH Overwrite:** The buffer overflow leads to overwriting the Structured Exception Handler (SEH), which is a mechanism used by Windows to handle exceptions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By overwriting the SEH, an attacker can redirect execution flow to an arbitrary location in memory. This allows the attacker to execute their own malicious code on the target system.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Webpage:** An attacker can embed a malicious ActiveX control within a webpage. When a user visits this webpage using Internet Explorer, the exploit is triggered.
*   **Internet Explorer:** The vulnerability is specifically exploitable through Internet Explorer as it's reliant on ActiveX controls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote attacker:** Can be a malicious user on the internet
*   **Ability to create a malicious webpage:** The attacker needs to host or inject the malicious ActiveX control into a website that the victim will visit.
*   **Target User Interaction:** The victim must visit the malicious website using Internet Explorer for the exploit to be triggered.

**Additional Details:**
*   The `BarcodeWiz.DLL` version less than 6.7 is vulnerable.
*   The advisory includes specific details about the SEH chain overwrite.
*   The affected ActiveX control has a CLSID of `{CD3B09F1-26FB-41CD-B3F2-E178DFD3BCC6}`.
*   The control is marked as safe for scripting and initialization.
