Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5172:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Live Bookmarks page and PDF viewer in Firefox incorrectly execute script pasted from the clipboard. This is because they do not properly sanitize the input, allowing the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input sanitization: The application doesn't sanitize text pasted from the clipboard, leading to the execution of malicious script.
- Cross-site scripting (XSS): The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject and execute JavaScript within the context of the Live Bookmarks page or PDF viewer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks: Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the affected page. This could be used to steal cookies, authorization tokens, or perform other actions on behalf of the user.
-  Social engineering: Attackers can trick users into copying and pasting malicious code, leading to unintended script execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- User interaction: The attack requires a user to copy malicious script content and paste it within the Live Bookmarks page or PDF viewer.
- Clipboard: The vulnerability leverages the clipboard as a means to transfer the malicious script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to prepare a malicious JavaScript that the victim can copy.
- The attacker must trick the victim into pasting the malicious script into either the Live Bookmarks page or the PDF viewer.
