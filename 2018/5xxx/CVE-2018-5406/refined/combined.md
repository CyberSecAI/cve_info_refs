  CERT Coordination Center report update
* ## Description

  The Quest team received a report from CERT Coordination Center regarding vulnerabilities involving the KACE System Management Appliance(SMA) below:

  CVE-2018-5404 Blind SQL Injection Vulnerability

  CVE-2018-5405 Stored XSS Vulnerability

  CVE-2018-5406 Misconfigured CORS Vulnerability

  Quest takes the handling of vulnerabilities seriously, and we investigate and respond to all reported potential vulnerabilities. Our vulnerability reporting and response process can be found [here](https://support.quest.com/essentials/reporting-security-vulnerability).
* ## Resolution

  Quest's investigation has determined that successful user authentication to the Admin or System user interfaces is required to take advantage of any of these vulnerabilities.

  These vulnerabilities have been addressed in our 9.1 release of the KACE SMA which can be downloaded [here](https://support.quest.com/kace-systems-management-appliance/9.1/download-new-releases).

## Multiple vulnerabilities in Quest Kace System Management Appliance

#### Vulnerability Note VU#877837

Original Release Date: 2019-06-01 | Last Revised: 2019-06-03

---

### Overview

The Quest Kace System Management (K1000) Appliance contains multiple vulnerabilities, including a blind SQL injection vulnerability and a stored cross site scripting vulnerability. It also suffers from misconfigurations in the cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) mechanism and improperly validates source communications.

### Description

| [**CVE-2018-5404**](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-5404): The Quest Kace System Management (K1000) Appliance allows an authenticated, remote attacker with least privileges ('User Console Only' role) to potentially exploit multiple Blind SQL Injection vulnerabilities to retrieve sensitive information from the database or copy the entire database. ([CWE-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html))  [**CVE-2018-5405**](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-5405): The Quest Kace System Management (K1000) Appliance allows an authenticated least privileged user with ‘User Console Only’ rights to potentially inject arbitrary JavaScript code on the tickets page. Script execution could allow a malicious user of the system to steal session cookies of other users including Administrator and take over their session. This can further be exploited to launch other attacks. The software also does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users. The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users. ([CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html))[**CVE-2018-5406**](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-5406): The Quest Kace System Management (K1000) Appliance allows a remote attacker to exploit the misconfigured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) mechanism. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform sensitive actions such as adding a new administrator account or changing the appliance’s settings. A malicious internal user could also gain administrator privileges of this appliance and use it to visit a malicious link that exploits this vulnerability. This could cause the application to perform sensitive actions such as adding a new administrator account or changing the appliance’s settings. ([CWE-284](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)) |
| --- |

### Impact

| An authenticated remote attacker could leverage Blind SQL injections to obtain sensitive data. An authenticated user with "user console only" rights may inject arbitrary JavaScript, which could result in an attacker taking over a session of others, including an Administrator. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could add an administrator-level account or change the appliance's settings. |

* ## Title

  CERT Coordination Center report update
* ## Description

  The Quest team received a report from CERT Coordination Center regarding vulnerabilities involving the KACE System Management Appliance(SMA) below:

  CVE-2018-5404 Blind SQL Injection Vulnerability

  CVE-2018-5405 Stored XSS Vulnerability

  CVE-2018-5406 Misconfigured CORS Vulnerability

  Quest takes the handling of vulnerabilities seriously, and we investigate and respond to all reported potential vulnerabilities. Our vulnerability reporting and response process can be found [here](https://support.quest.com/essentials/reporting-security-vulnerability).
* ## Resolution

  Quest's investigation has determined that successful user authentication to the Admin or System user interfaces is required to take advantage of any of these vulnerabilities.

  These vulnerabilities have been addressed in our 9.1 release of the KACE SMA which can be downloaded [here](https://support.quest.com/kace-systems-management-appliance/9.1/download-new-releases).
