  "CVE-2018-5745": {
    "description": "An assertion failure was found in the way bind implemented the \"managed keys\" feature. An attacker could use this flaw to cause the named daemon to crash. This flaw is very difficult for an attacker to trigger because it requires an operator to have BIND configured to use a trust anchor managed by the attacker.",
    "root_cause": "An error in the managed-keys feature.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Assertion failure causing denial of service."
    ],
    "impact": "The named daemon to crash, resulting in denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker could use a trust anchor managed by the attacker and cause a bind server which uses managed-keys to exit due to an assertion failure.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the operator to have BIND configured to use a trust anchor managed by the attacker. This makes exploitation very difficult."
