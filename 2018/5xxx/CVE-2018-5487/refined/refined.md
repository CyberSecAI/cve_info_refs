Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5487:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The content directly references **CVE-2018-5487** and provides information specific to this CVE, confirming its relevance.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability stems from the fact that OnCommand Unified Manager versions 7.2 through 7.3 for Linux and Windows ship with the **Java Management Extension Remote Method Invocation (JMX RMI) service bound to the network**.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution:** The JMX RMI service is accessible without authentication, creating an attack vector that can lead to remote code execution.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected OnCommand Unified Manager servers. This can lead to a complete compromise of the system.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - The attack vector is **network-based**, targeting the exposed JMX RMI service.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Network Access:** An attacker needs network connectivity to the target OnCommand Unified Manager server and must be able to reach the JMX RMI service via ports 5679 and 33333.
   - **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any valid credentials to trigger the vulnerability.
