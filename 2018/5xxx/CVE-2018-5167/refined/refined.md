Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5167:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The web console and JavaScript debugger were not properly sanitizing output, leading to the improper linkification of `chrome:` and `javascript:` URLs. Specifically, these tools were treating these URLs as active hyperlinks, which could be clicked by users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Sanitization:** The core issue is the lack of proper sanitization of URLs in the web console and JavaScript debugger.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The debugger displaying `javascript:` links could lead to XSS attacks, as users could be tricked into clicking on them.
- **Exposure of internal browser functionality:** Allowing `chrome:` links to be active could expose internal browser functionality to malicious sites.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** While the `javascript:` links execute in an unprivileged context, it was shown that request headers including cookies and authorization tokens, could be accessed.
- **Security Context Bypass:** The ability to link to `chrome:` pages directly from web content could bypass security protections put in place.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Web Pages:** Attackers could craft malicious web pages that log `javascript:` or `chrome:` URLs to the console, or include them as values in a debugger watch expression.
- **Social Engineering:** Users could be tricked into clicking the malicious links displayed in the console or debugger.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the content that gets displayed in the web console or JavaScript debugger.
- The attacker relies on the user to interact with the malicious links (click on them)

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was discovered by Wladimir Palant.
- The fix involves removing `javascript:` from the list of valid protocols for linkification in the affected components and preventing `chrome:` links from working in the content console/debugger clients.
- A separate bug was to be opened for fully disallowing `chrome:` and `resource:` links.
-  The fix was implemented by modifying the `reps.js` file which was used by the old console and the debugger and removing javascript from the list of valid protocols.
