#### [#CVE-2018-5158: Malicious PDF can inject JavaScript into PDF Viewer](#CVE-2018-5158)

Reporter
Wladimir Palant
Impact
high
##### Description

The PDF viewer does not sufficiently sanitize PostScript calculator functions, allowing malicious JavaScript to be injected through a crafted PDF file. This JavaScript can then be run with the permissions of the PDF viewer by its worker.

##### References

* [Bug 1452075](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1452075)

#### [#CVE-2018-5159: Integer overflow and out-of-bounds write in Skia](#CVE-2018-5159)

Reporter
Ivan Fratric
Impact
high
##### Description

An integer overflow can occur in the Skia library due to 32-bit integer use in an array without integer overflow checks, resulting in possible out-of-bounds writes. This could lead to a potentially exploitable crash triggerable by web content.

##### References

* [Bug 1441941](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1441941)

#### [#CVE-2018-5160: Uninitialized memory use by WebRTC encoder](#CVE-2018-5160)

Reporter
Andreas Perhson

##### References

* [Bug 1436117](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1436117)

#### [#CVE-2018-5152: WebExtensions information leak through webRequest API](#CVE-2018-5152)

Reporter
Andy McKay
Impact
moderate
##### Description

WebExtensions with the appropriate permissions can attach content scripts to Mozilla sites such as accounts.firefox.com and listen to network traffic to the site through the `webRequest` API. For example, this allows for the interception of username and an encrypted password during login to Firefox Accounts. This issue does not expose synchronization traffic directly and is limited to the process of user login to the website and the data displayed to the user once logged in.

##### References

* [Bug 1415644](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1415644)
* [Bug 1427289](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1427289)

#### [#CVE-2018-5153: Out-of-bounds read in mixed content websocket messages](#CVE-2018-5153)

Reporter
Dennis Fuchs
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If websocket data is sent with mixed text and binary in a single message, the binary data can be corrupted. This can result in an out-of-bounds read with the read memory sent to the originating server in response.

##### References

* [Bug 1436809](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1436809)

#### [#CVE-2018-5163: Replacing cached data in JavaScript Start-up Bytecode Cache](#CVE-2018-5163)

Reporter
Nicolas B. Pierron
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If a malicious attacker has used another vulnerability to gain full control over a content process, they may be able to replace the alternate data resources stored in the JavaScript Start-up Bytecode Cache (JSBC) for other JavaScript code. If the parent process then runs this replaced code, the executed script would be run with the parent process' privileges, escaping the sandbox on content processes.

##### References

* [Bug 1426353](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1426353)

#### [#CVE-2018-5164: CSP not applied to all multipart content sent with multipart/x-mixed-replace](#CVE-2018-5164)

Reporter
Khalil Zhani
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Content Security Policy (CSP) is not applied correctly to all parts of multipart content sent with the `multipart/x-mixed-replace` MIME type. This could allow for script to run where CSP should block it, allowing for cross-site scripting (XSS) and other attacks.

##### References

* [Bug 1416045](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1416045)

#### [#CVE-2018-5166: WebExtension host permission bypass through filterReponseData](#CVE-2018-5166)

Reporter
Francois Lajeunesse Robert
Impact
moderate
##### Description

WebExtensions can use request redirection and a `filterReponseData` filter to bypass host permission settings to redirect network traffic and access content from a host for which they do not have explicit user permission.

##### References

* [Bug 1437325](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1437325)

#### [#CVE-2018-5167: Improper linkification of chrome: and javascript: content in web console and JavaScript debugger](#CVE-2018-5167)

Reporter
Wladimir Palant
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The web console and JavaScript debugger do not sanitize all output that can be hyperlinked. Both will display `chrome:` links as active, clickable hyperlinks in their output. Web sites should not be able to directly link to internal chrome pages. Additionally, the JavaScript debugger will display `javascript:` links, which users could be tricked into clicking by malicious sites.

##### References

* [Bug 1447969](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1447969)

#### [#CVE-2018-5168: Lightweight themes can be installed without user interaction](#CVE-2018-5168)

Reporter
Wladimir Palant
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Sites can bypass security checks on permissions to install lightweight themes by manipulating the `baseURI` property of the theme element. This could allow a malicious site to install a theme without user interaction which could contain offensive or embarrassing images.

##### References

* [Bug 1449548](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1449548)

#### [#CVE-2018-5169: Dragging and dropping link text onto home button can set home page to include chrome pages](#CVE-2018-5169)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If manipulated hyperlinked text with `chrome:` URL contained in it is dragged and dropped on the "home" icon, the home page can be reset to include a normally-unlinkable chrome page as one of the home page tabs.

##### References

* [Bug 1319157](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1319157)

#### [#CVE-2018-5172: Pasted script from clipboard can run in the Live Bookmarks page or PDF viewer](#CVE-2018-5172)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The Live Bookmarks page and the PDF viewer can run injected script content if a user pastes script from the clipboard into them while viewing RSS feeds or PDF files. This could allow a malicious site to socially engineer a user to copy and paste malicious script content that could then run with the context of either page but does not allow for privilege escalation.

##### References

* [Bug 1436482](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1436482)

#### [#CVE-2018-5173: File name spoofing of Downloads panel with Unicode characters](#CVE-2018-5173)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The filename appearing in the `Downloads` panel improperly renders some Unicode characters, allowing for the file name to be spoofed. This can be used to obscure the file extension of potentially executable files from user view in the panel.
*Note: the dialog to open the file will show the full, correct filename and whether it is executable or not.*

##### References

* [Bug 1438025](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1438025)

#### [#CVE-2018-5174: Windows Defender SmartScreen UI runs with less secure behavior for downloaded files in Windows 10 April 2018 Update](#CVE-2018-5174)

Reporter
Jimmy
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In the Windows 10 April 2018 Update, Windows Defender SmartScreen honors the `SEE_MASK_FLAG_NO_UI` flag associated with downloaded files and will not show any UI. Files that are unknown and potentially dangerous will be allowed to run because SmartScreen will not prompt the user for a decision, and if the user is offline all files will be allowed to be opened because Windows won’t prompt the user to ask what to do. Firefox incorrectly sets this flag when downloading files, leading to less secure behavior from SmartScreen.
*Note: this issue only affects Windows 10 users running the April 2018 update or later. It does not affect other Windows users or other operating systems.*

* [Bug 1447080](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1447080)

#### [#CVE-2018-5175: Universal CSP bypass on sites using strict-dynamic in their policies](#CVE-2018-5175)

Reporter
Masato Kinugawa
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A mechanism to bypass Content Security Policy (CSP) protections on sites that have a `script-src` policy of `'strict-dynamic'`. If a target website contains an HTML injection flaw an attacker could inject a reference to a copy of the `require.js` library that is part of Firefox’s Developer Tools, and then use a known technique using that library to bypass the CSP restrictions on executing injected scripts.

##### References

* [Bug 1432358](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1432358)

#### [#CVE-2018-5176: JSON Viewer script injection](#CVE-2018-5176)

Reporter
Tadj Youssouf
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The JSON Viewer displays clickable hyperlinks for strings that are parseable as URLs, including `javascript:` links. If a JSON file contains malicious JavaScript script embedded as `javascript:` links, users may be tricked into clicking and running this code in the context of the JSON Viewer. This can allow for the theft of cookies and authorization tokens which are accessible to that context.

##### References

* [Bug 1442840](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1442840)

#### [#CVE-2018-5177: Buffer overflow in XSLT during number formatting](#CVE-2018-5177)

Reporter
Guyio
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A vulnerability exists in XSLT during number formatting where a negative buffer size may be allocated in some instances, leading to a buffer overflow and crash if it occurs.

##### References

* [Bug 1451908](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1451908)

#### [#CVE-2018-5165: Checkbox for enabling Flash protected mode is inverted in 32-bit Firefox](#CVE-2018-5165)

Reporter
David Parks
Impact
low
##### Description

In 32-bit versions of Firefox, the Adobe Flash plugin setting for "Enable Adobe Flash protected mode" is unchecked by default even though the Adobe Flash sandbox is actually enabled. The displayed state is the reverse of the true setting, resulting in user confusion. This could cause users to select this setting intending to activate it and inadvertently turn protections off.

##### References

* [Bug 1451452](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1451452)

#### [#CVE-2018-5180: heap-use-after-free in mozilla::WebGLContext::DrawElementsInstanced](#CVE-2018-5180)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
low
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur during WebGL operations. While this results in a potentially exploitable crash, the vulnerability is limited because the memory is freed and reused in a brief window of time during the freeing of the same callstack.

##### References

* [Bug 1444086](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1444086)

#### [#CVE-2018-5181: Local file can be displayed in noopener tab through drag and drop of hyperlink](#CVE-2018-5181)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
low
##### Description

If a URL using the `file:` protocol is dragged and dropped onto an open tab that is running in a different child process the tab will open a local file corresponding to the dropped URL, contrary to policy. One way to make the target tab open more reliably in a separate process is to open it with the `noopener` keyword.

##### References

* [Bug 1424107](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1424107)

#### [#CVE-2018-5182: Local file can be displayed from hyperlink dragged and dropped on addressbar](#CVE-2018-5182)

Reporter
Jordi Chancel
Impact
low
##### Description

If a text string that happens to be a filename in the operating system's native format is dragged and dropped onto the addressbar the specified local file will be opened. This is contrary to policy and is what would happen if the string were the equivalent `file:` URL.

##### References

* [Bug 1435908](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1435908)

#### [#CVE-2018-5179: Service workers can self update to keep a worker running](#CVE-2018-5179)

Reporter
Yannic Bonenberger
Impact
low
##### Description

A service worker can send the "activate" event on itself periodically which allows it to run perpetually. This would allow any malicious activity, such as logging an IP address by the service worker, to occur in the background.

Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner

# USN-3645-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

11 May 2018

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application

crash, bypass same-origin restrictions, conduct cross-site scripting (XSS)

attacks, install lightweight themes without user interaction, spoof the

filename in the downloads panel, or execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-5150](/security/CVE-2018-5150), [CVE-2018-5151](/security/CVE-2018-5151), [CVE-2018-5153](/security/CVE-2018-5153), [CVE-2018-5154](/security/CVE-2018-5154),

[CVE-2018-5155](/security/CVE-2018-5155), [CVE-2018-5157](/security/CVE-2018-5157), [CVE-2018-5158](/security/CVE-2018-5158), [CVE-2018-5159](/security/CVE-2018-5159), [CVE-2018-5160](/security/CVE-2018-5160),

[CVE-2018-5163](/security/CVE-2018-5163), [CVE-2018-5164](/security/CVE-2018-5164), [CVE-2018-5168](/security/CVE-2018-5168), [CVE-2018-5173](/security/CVE-2018-5173), [CVE-2018-5175](/security/CVE-2018-5175),

[CVE-2018-5177](/security/CVE-2018-5177), [CVE-2018-5180](/security/CVE-2018-5180))

Multiple security issues were discovered with WebExtensions. If a user

were tricked in to installing a specially crafted extension, an attacker

could potentially exploit these to obtain sensitive information, or bypass

security restrictions. ([CVE-2018-5152](/security/CVE-2018-5152), [CVE-2018-5166](/security/CVE-2018-5166))

It was discovered that the web console and JavaScript debugger incorrectly

linkified chrome: and javascript URLs. If a user were tricked in to

clicking a specially crafted link, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. ([CVE-2018-5167](/security/CVE-2018-5167))

It was discovered that dragging and dropping link text on to the home

button could set the home page to include chrome pages. If a user were

tricked in to dragging and dropping a specially crafted link on to the

home button, an attacker could potentially exploit this bypass security

restrictions. ([CVE-2018-5169](/security/CVE-2018-5169))

It was discovered that the Live Bookmarks page and PDF viewer would run

script pasted from the clipboard. If a user were tricked in to copying and

pasting specially crafted text, an attacker could potentially exploit this

to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. ([CVE-2018-5172](/security/CVE-2018-5172))

It was discovered that the JSON viewer incorrectly linkified javascript:

URLs. If a user were tricked in to clicking on a specially crafted link,

an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information. ([CVE-2018-5176](/security/CVE-2018-5176))

It was discovered that dragging a file: URL on to a tab that is running in

a different process would cause the file to open in that process. If a

user were tricked in to dragging a file: URL, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to bypass intended security policies.

([CVE-2018-5181](/security/CVE-2018-5181))

It was discovered that dragging text that is a file: URL on to the

addressbar would open the specified file. If a user were tricked in to

dragging specially crafted text on to the addressbar, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to bypass intended security policies.

([CVE-2018-5182](/security/CVE-2018-5182))

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:58.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/58.0
Build ID: 20180206200532
Steps to reproduce:
By leveraging the request redirection and filterReponseData, one can bypass the host permission to access content returned by an arbitrary host.
Actual results:
The attachment is a POC extension that have the webRequest, webRequestBlocking and <http://localhost> permission that upon loading will :
1- Open a new tabs to <http://localhost>
2- Redirect the request toward <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/user_profile>
3- Output the content of <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/user_profile> in the console
4- Close the tab
Expected results:
filterResponseData should be allowed only if the extension has the host permission for the fetched resource.

The issue here is that StreamFilter is not disconnected upon a redirect.
The filter remains connected and receives data on the redirected channel. In a poorly written extension, this could result in multiple filters receiving the data. A short test I did, based on the attached extension, initiated a tab to <http://allizom.org>, which redirected -> <https://allizom.org> -> <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org> and I received 3 dumps of the page content for bugzilla. Note that for that to happen I changed to all\_urls.
I'm really not certain of the sec severity here, if I were after the page content of a site I'd just request all\_urls to begin with since I wouldn't have to depend on a bug and IMO that permission would likely bypass user scrutiny.

For CSP we had to hook redirects and re-evaluate the policy permissions at each redirect. I think your filter will have to do the same and kill the stream when you bounce to an unallowed host.Keywords: [sec-moderate](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-moderate&resolution=---)

I'm inclined towards always disconnecting StreamFilter on a redirect.

I was unable to reproduce the bug on Firefox 60.0a1 (20180210220139).
I have attached the results I get when testing on the latest nightly Firefox 61.0a1 (20180313100127).
I just loaded the extension temporary and looked in the console for the output, tried this while logged in and out from <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org>.Flags: needinfo?(marius.santa)

A response returning application/json will be displayed in the JSON Viewer and links in the data will be linkified. While this might be convenient, javascript: links will also be linkified. Web services don't expect that JSON output needs to be sanitized, so injecting a javascript: URL into the output is often trivial. See for example this Mozilla URL:
> [https://token.services.mozilla.com/1.0/sync/javascript:alert(JSON.stringify(JSONView.headers.request%29%29](https://token.services.mozilla.com/1.0/sync/javascript%3Aalert%28JSON.stringify%28JSONView.headers.request%29%29)
If the user somehow clicks value of the errors.0.name property an alert message will show up - JavaScript code executed successfully. And while the principal is set to the null principal so that the code cannot access document.cookies for example, it can access the JSONView object injected by the JSON Viewer. That object contains among other things all request headers - meaning also cookies and authorization tokens.
This JavaScript code can also trigger saving of arbitrary content, though that shouldn't be as critical:
> [https://token.services.mozilla.com/1.0/sync/javascript:void(window.dispatchEvent(new%2520CustomEvent(%2527contentMessage%2527,%7Bdetail:%7Btype:%2527save%2527,value:%2527data:,foobar%2527%7D%7D%29%29%29](https://token.services.mozilla.com/1.0/sync/javascript%3Avoid%28window.dispatchEvent%28new%2520CustomEvent%28%2527contentMessage%2527%2C%7Bdetail%3A%7Btype%3A%2527save%2527%2Cvalue%3A%2527data%3A%2Cfoobar%2527%7D%7D%29%29%29)
Clearly, JSON Viewer should only linkify HTTP and HTTPS URLs. For reference, the problematic code line is <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/6ff60a083701d08c52702daf50f28e8f46ae3a1c/devtools/client/shared/components/reps/reps.js#88>. While this also allows data: and chrome: URLs, browser security mechanisms will no longer allow navigating to those.

After updating Nightly this appears to be fixed, I guess that this is a duplicate? In Firefox 59.0.1 this issue is still reproducible.

It seems that <https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/aa46f0522cfd> (meaning [bug 1440388](/show_bug.cgi?id=1440388 "RESOLVED FIXED - Devtools Reps: update bundle to v0.21.0")) removed javascript from validProtocols variable, a change not visible in DXR yet for some reason. The same code exists in two other locations in the Firefox codebase however and hasn't been updated there. The old console frontend doesn't appear to be used any more, but the JavaScript debugger still uses the problematic code. You can see by adding "javascript:alert(1)" as watch expression in the debugger - clicking the value will show an alert.
There is another issue here: both console and debugger will still linkify chrome:// URLs. So if a website logs "chrome://global/content/" to console or if you have it as a value in a debugger watch expression, this link will work. A while back websites were forbidden from linking to chrome:// because it could introduce security issues because browser UI didn't expect untrusted parameters. Here Firefox still allows websites to link to chrome:// and potentially exploit security issues, even if users are far less likely to click the links.

Nominating this for bounty consideration.
Can you submit some easier STR for a test case that isn't in the JSON viewer? :)
Whichever is easiest to help reproducing and understanding this issue better.
Also, can you come up with a list of all the affected code? [Comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=1447969#c2 "VERIFIED FIXED - Old console and current debugger linkify javascript: URLs") seems a bit incomprehensive.

:nchevobbe, can we also update these with the new reps bundle? Though see below.

I think we don't want to break this outright because those links should work in the browser console and debugger.
It seems more likely that we should alter the openLinks parameter for those tools so that it doesn't trigger opening those links if not loaded in the browser toolbox / console.Flags: needinfo?(nchevobbe)

So, javascript: URLs should not be linkified in the console nor browser console anymore, since they both use the reps bundle.
<https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/devtools/client/webconsole/console-output.js#l31> is the old console frontend (which do not use reps), which when [Bug 1347127](/show_bug.cgi?id=1347127 "RESOLVED FIXED - Enable new console frontend in Browser Toolbox") land won't be used anywhere. We can still remove the "javascript" element from the valid protocol list for the old frontend and uplift it if you want.
The debugger was updated to use the latest Reps version this week (see <https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/pull/5714>), and the debugger bundle containing this should land soon in mozilla central.
Regarding chrome: and data: urls, what is the risk here ?Flags: needinfo?(nchevobbe)

data: URIs present no risk from what I can tell. When in content, they won't load (top navigation to data: URIs is forbidden now). In developer tools these will open in a new tab, without inheriting any security context.
As to chrome: URLs, I cannot find the bug where linking from content to chrome: was disallowed, that was a long time ago. I only remember that it was about a Firefox vulnerability where opening a chrome: URL with particular parameters resulted in execution of arbitrary code with chrome privileges. It was deemed that allowing webpages to trigger arbitrary chrome: URLs is too dangerous.

Looks to me like this is addressed in [comment #6](/show_bug.cgi?id=1447969#c6 "VERIFIED FIXED - Old console and current debugger linkify javascript: URLs"). My understanding is that both cases are now fixed on nightly with the new reps bundle, and the fact that the old console is dead (and has been dead for content consoles since 57, though AIUI the new frontend will be vulnerable in 59/60 given it doesn't have the new reps bundle). :nchevobbe and Wladimir, can you confirm? :nchevobbe: How upliftable is the reps bundle change? Do we need to uplift spot-fixes for the console and/or debugger to 60? If so we can consider doing that either here or in a separate sec-sensitive bug?

Preventing this is part of our defense-in-depth strategy, yes. However, given that the console and debugger cases require the user to manually open those devtools on an attacking page (as opposed to the json viewer which can open in-content and is therefore more vulnerable to clickjacking techniques etc.), an attack that uses chrome: URLs seems somewhat implausible to me (nor do I know of any current issues where just loading a chrome URI causes issues - if such issues exist they ought to be fixed separately, so please report in a new bug). Not significantly more likely than, say, putting the link in the clipboard and telling the user to click 'paste and go' from the location bar context menu (which will work, IIRC).
I still think we should fix it, but as I said in [comment #4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1447969#c4 "VERIFIED FIXED - Old console and current debugger linkify javascript: URLs"), it's not as straightforward as just disallowing them - frontend developers still need to be able to click links in the browser console to open the relevant source (which I noticed was broken on Nightly recently, I need to check if it's fixed by now...).
Given all of that, I would like to open a separate (public, sec-want/sec-audit) bug for disallowing chrome: and resource: links (really, anything non-http/https, maybe non-protocol-of-debuggee so that we don't kill file: links for users debugging file: pages) for content console/debugger clients.Flags: needinfo?(nchevobbe)Flags: needinfo?(gaubugzilla)

(Note that the fixes in [bug 1442840](/show_bug.cgi?id=1442840 "VERIFIED FIXED - Iframe injection & content spoofing & scripts execution via json viewer") will mean chrome: URIs should not be opened anymore for links in the JSON viewer, only http/https links, even if they still 'look' linkified, they have a click handler that will prevent opening them)

It's not easily upliftable as is, there are many other changes that needs different call sites options in the tools that use them. What we could do is simply alter the valid protocol array in 59 and 60, bot in reps.js and in debugger-bundle (which includes reps). I never done anything like that so I don't know what would be the proper way to handle this.Flags: needinfo?(nchevobbe)

Yes, I can confirm that javascript: URLs are no longer linkified in the debugger. The problematic code is still there for the old console but no longer used from what I can tell.

Well, source links should open in the debugger view rather than a new tab but I see your point.

Fine with me. I merely didn't want this aspect of the issue to be forgotten.Flags: needinfo?(gaubugzilla)

This sgtm as a simple way of mitigating the JS angle here. I'm reopening this so we can track this fix here.

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]: n/a
[User impact if declined]: minor security issues in old console (should be unused except for browser console, which has to be preffed on and hopefully has clue-ful users) and js debugger (requiring significant user interaction)
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]: generally yes
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]: a different fix was applied in nightly, so no.
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]: not really
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]: n/a
[Is the change risky?]: no
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]: this breaks linking javascript: URIs for the old console and debugger. Nothing and nobody should be relying on that working.
[String changes made/needed]: no

For the JSON Viewer, the patch in the other bug only linkified http/https, and it enforces opening the links in a new tab.
I don't know what codepath the console and debugger use to open links, and if they could ever be convinced to load them in the same tab. As Wladimir said elsewhere in this bug (I think?) navigation to toplevel data: URIs is now prevented anyway ( <https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2017/11/27/blocking-top-level-navigations-data-urls-firefox-59/> ) -- but coincidentally, I think that shipped a release later than planned, and there's still an about:config pref to turn it off.
So I was mostly being cautious. If we're confident that they can't be used for an attack I'm fine leaving the reps bundle to link them, also because I understand that they can be useful.
Out of curiosity, how do we deal with links in the inspector? Like image data: URIs in the style sidebar for list-style-image and background-image and the like? I assume they don't use either the debugger or the console codepath here...
Do you want us to land a follow-up patch to unblock data: URIs on 60 for the old console frontend + debugger? Personally, I think the risk+effort/reward calculus means we shouldn't, but I could be persuaded otherwise...Flags: needinfo?(gijskruitbosch+bugs) → needinfo?(nchevobbe)

As I mentioned, debugger opens data: links in a new tab - it ignores that "no top-level navigation to data:" pref but otherwise it's unproblematic.

I tried Firefox 60.0b8 today and I see something weird. javascript: URLs in the JSON Viewer are linkified but clicks are ignored - that's fine. javascript: URLs in watch expression in the JS Debugger aren't linkified, same goes for the Browser Console - also fine. However, the console in the Web Developer tools will still linkify javascript: URLs, e.g. if the page does console.log("javascript:alert('oops')"). These links open in a new tab and the code executes in an unprivileged context (about:blank), but this still shouldn't be.Flags: needinfo?(gaubugzilla)

Actually, my findings above aren't weird at all seeing that the instance under <https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-beta/file/85da1c81b9f4/devtools/client/shared/components/reps/reps.js#l88> hasn't been changed. While it doesn't matter for the JSON Viewer (clicks on javascript: links aren't processed due to changes in [bug 1442840](/show_bug.cgi?id=1442840 "VERIFIED FIXED - Iframe injection & content spoofing & scripts execution via json viewer")), this code is also used by the new console fronten.

Right... Nicholas, we could uplift a 1-line fix to the reps bundle for this, or uplift the reps bundle change, or do nothing. Given there isn't a concrete security impact for 60 anymore, I could live with the last option - but on the other hand, this will be an ESR release and it may be nice to have that change for 60 anyway. Up to you...
