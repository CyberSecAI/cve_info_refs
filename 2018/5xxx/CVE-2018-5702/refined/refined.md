    "CVE-2018-5702": {
      "root_cause": "The Transmission BitTorrent client relied on the `X-Transmission-Session-Id` header for access control, which is not a forbidden header for Fetch. This allowed remote attackers to bypass access control using a DNS rebinding attack.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure RPC handling",
        "Reliance on a non-forbidden header for access control",
        "Vulnerability to DNS rebinding attacks"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote attackers could execute arbitrary RPC commands, which could lead to writing to arbitrary files. This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Visiting a malicious website",
        "DNS rebinding attack",
        "POST requests to /transmission/rpc"
      ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": [
        "Ability to create a malicious website",
        "Control of a DNS server (or compromised DNS records)",
        "Ability to send POST requests to the Transmission RPC endpoint"
      ],
       "additional_details": "The vulnerability can be exploited using a DNS rebinding attack where a website uses a domain that alternates between the attacker's IP and localhost, allowing the attacker to bypass the same-origin policy and send requests to the vulnerable Transmission daemon running on the user's machine. The attacker can then use RPC calls to manipulate Transmission settings, including setting a download directory and executing arbitrary commands using the `script-torrent-done-enabled` option."
