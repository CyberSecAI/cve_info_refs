##### References

* [Bug 1449898](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1449898)

#### [#CVE-2018-5158: Malicious PDF can inject JavaScript into PDF Viewer](#CVE-2018-5158)

Reporter
Wladimir Palant
Impact
high
##### Description

The PDF viewer does not sufficiently sanitize PostScript calculator functions, allowing malicious JavaScript to be injected through a crafted PDF file. This JavaScript can then be run with the permissions of the PDF viewer by its worker.

##### References

* [Bug 1452075](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1452075)

#### [#CVE-2018-5159: Integer overflow and out-of-bounds write in Skia](#CVE-2018-5159)

Reporter
Ivan Fratric
Impact
high
##### Description

An integer overflow can occur in the Skia library due to 32-bit integer use in an array without integer overflow checks, resulting in possible out-of-bounds writes. This could lead to a potentially exploitable crash triggerable by web content.

##### References

* [Bug 1441941](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1441941)

#### [#CVE-2018-5160: Uninitialized memory use by WebRTC encoder](#CVE-2018-5160)

Reporter
Andreas Perhson

* [Bug 1436117](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1436117)

#### [#CVE-2018-5152: WebExtensions information leak through webRequest API](#CVE-2018-5152)

Reporter
Andy McKay
Impact
moderate
##### Description

WebExtensions with the appropriate permissions can attach content scripts to Mozilla sites such as accounts.firefox.com and listen to network traffic to the site through the `webRequest` API. For example, this allows for the interception of username and an encrypted password during login to Firefox Accounts. This issue does not expose synchronization traffic directly and is limited to the process of user login to the website and the data displayed to the user once logged in.

##### References

* [Bug 1415644](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1415644)
* [Bug 1427289](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1427289)

#### [#CVE-2018-5153: Out-of-bounds read in mixed content websocket messages](#CVE-2018-5153)

Reporter
Dennis Fuchs
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If websocket data is sent with mixed text and binary in a single message, the binary data can be corrupted. This can result in an out-of-bounds read with the read memory sent to the originating server in response.

##### References

* [Bug 1436809](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1436809)

#### [#CVE-2018-5163: Replacing cached data in JavaScript Start-up Bytecode Cache](#CVE-2018-5163)

Reporter
Nicolas B. Pierron
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If a malicious attacker has used another vulnerability to gain full control over a content process, they may be able to replace the alternate data resources stored in the JavaScript Start-up Bytecode Cache (JSBC) for other JavaScript code. If the parent process then runs this replaced code, the executed script would be run with the parent process' privileges, escaping the sandbox on content processes.

* [Bug 1426353](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1426353)

#### [#CVE-2018-5164: CSP not applied to all multipart content sent with multipart/x-mixed-replace](#CVE-2018-5164)

Reporter
Khalil Zhani
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Content Security Policy (CSP) is not applied correctly to all parts of multipart content sent with the `multipart/x-mixed-replace` MIME type. This could allow for script to run where CSP should block it, allowing for cross-site scripting (XSS) and other attacks.

##### References

* [Bug 1416045](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1416045)

#### [#CVE-2018-5166: WebExtension host permission bypass through filterReponseData](#CVE-2018-5166)

Reporter
Francois Lajeunesse Robert
Impact
moderate
##### Description

WebExtensions can use request redirection and a `filterReponseData` filter to bypass host permission settings to redirect network traffic and access content from a host for which they do not have explicit user permission.

##### References

* [Bug 1437325](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1437325)

#### [#CVE-2018-5167: Improper linkification of chrome: and javascript: content in web console and JavaScript debugger](#CVE-2018-5167)

Reporter
Wladimir Palant
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The web console and JavaScript debugger do not sanitize all output that can be hyperlinked. Both will display `chrome:` links as active, clickable hyperlinks in their output. Web sites should not be able to directly link to internal chrome pages. Additionally, the JavaScript debugger will display `javascript:` links, which users could be tricked into clicking by malicious sites.

##### References

* [Bug 1447969](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1447969)

#### [#CVE-2018-5168: Lightweight themes can be installed without user interaction](#CVE-2018-5168)

Reporter
Wladimir Palant
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Sites can bypass security checks on permissions to install lightweight themes by manipulating the `baseURI` property of the theme element. This could allow a malicious site to install a theme without user interaction which could contain offensive or embarrassing images.

##### References

* [Bug 1449548](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1449548)

#### [#CVE-2018-5169: Dragging and dropping link text onto home button can set home page to include chrome pages](#CVE-2018-5169)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If manipulated hyperlinked text with `chrome:` URL contained in it is dragged and dropped on the "home" icon, the home page can be reset to include a normally-unlinkable chrome page as one of the home page tabs.

##### References

* [Bug 1319157](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1319157)

#### [#CVE-2018-5172: Pasted script from clipboard can run in the Live Bookmarks page or PDF viewer](#CVE-2018-5172)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The Live Bookmarks page and the PDF viewer can run injected script content if a user pastes script from the clipboard into them while viewing RSS feeds or PDF files. This could allow a malicious site to socially engineer a user to copy and paste malicious script content that could then run with the context of either page but does not allow for privilege escalation.

##### References

* [Bug 1436482](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1436482)

#### [#CVE-2018-5173: File name spoofing of Downloads panel with Unicode characters](#CVE-2018-5173)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The filename appearing in the `Downloads` panel improperly renders some Unicode characters, allowing for the file name to be spoofed. This can be used to obscure the file extension of potentially executable files from user view in the panel.
*Note: the dialog to open the file will show the full, correct filename and whether it is executable or not.*

* [Bug 1438025](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1438025)

#### [#CVE-2018-5174: Windows Defender SmartScreen UI runs with less secure behavior for downloaded files in Windows 10 April 2018 Update](#CVE-2018-5174)

Reporter
Jimmy
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In the Windows 10 April 2018 Update, Windows Defender SmartScreen honors the `SEE_MASK_FLAG_NO_UI` flag associated with downloaded files and will not show any UI. Files that are unknown and potentially dangerous will be allowed to run because SmartScreen will not prompt the user for a decision, and if the user is offline all files will be allowed to be opened because Windows won’t prompt the user to ask what to do. Firefox incorrectly sets this flag when downloading files, leading to less secure behavior from SmartScreen.
*Note: this issue only affects Windows 10 users running the April 2018 update or later. It does not affect other Windows users or other operating systems.*

* [Bug 1447080](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1447080)

#### [#CVE-2018-5175: Universal CSP bypass on sites using strict-dynamic in their policies](#CVE-2018-5175)

Reporter
Masato Kinugawa
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A mechanism to bypass Content Security Policy (CSP) protections on sites that have a `script-src` policy of `'strict-dynamic'`. If a target website contains an HTML injection flaw an attacker could inject a reference to a copy of the `require.js` library that is part of Firefox’s Developer Tools, and then use a known technique using that library to bypass the CSP restrictions on executing injected scripts.

* [Bug 1432358](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1432358)

#### [#CVE-2018-5176: JSON Viewer script injection](#CVE-2018-5176)

Reporter
Tadj Youssouf
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The JSON Viewer displays clickable hyperlinks for strings that are parseable as URLs, including `javascript:` links. If a JSON file contains malicious JavaScript script embedded as `javascript:` links, users may be tricked into clicking and running this code in the context of the JSON Viewer. This can allow for the theft of cookies and authorization tokens which are accessible to that context.

##### Description

In 32-bit versions of Firefox, the Adobe Flash plugin setting for "Enable Adobe Flash protected mode" is unchecked by default even though the Adobe Flash sandbox is actually enabled. The displayed state is the reverse of the true setting, resulting in user confusion. This could cause users to select this setting intending to activate it and inadvertently turn protections off.

#### [#CVE-2018-5180: heap-use-after-free in mozilla::WebGLContext::DrawElementsInstanced](#CVE-2018-5180)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
low
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur during WebGL operations. While this results in a potentially exploitable crash, the vulnerability is limited because the memory is freed and reused in a brief window of time during the freeing of the same callstack.

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
low
##### Description

If a URL using the `file:` protocol is dragged and dropped onto an open tab that is running in a different child process the tab will open a local file corresponding to the dropped URL, contrary to policy. One way to make the target tab open more reliably in a separate process is to open it with the `noopener` keyword.

#### [#CVE-2018-5182: Local file can be displayed from hyperlink dragged and dropped on addressbar](#CVE-2018-5182)

Reporter
Jordi Chancel
Impact
low
##### Description

If a text string that happens to be a filename in the operating system's native format is dragged and dropped onto the addressbar the specified local file will be opened. This is contrary to policy and is what would happen if the string were the equivalent `file:` URL.

#### [#CVE-2018-5179: Service workers can self update to keep a worker running](#CVE-2018-5179)

Reporter
Yannic Bonenberger
Impact
low
##### Description

A service worker can send the "activate" event on itself periodically which allows it to run perpetually. This would allow any malicious activity, such as logging an IP address by the service worker, to occur in the background.

##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Jon Coppeard, Jason Kratzer, Nathan Froyd, Paul Theriault, Ryan VanderMeulen, Tyson Smith, Sebastian Hengst, Byron Campen, Emilio Cobos Álvarez, Ronald Crane, and Phillipp reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 59. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Install attached PoC
Actual results:
<https://addons.mozilla.org> is opened and then using browser.webRequest.filterResponseData we filter the script loading of google-analytics injecting it with our own code.
Expected results:
Usually when you mention "<all\_urls>" within the manifest permission you still can't execute JS on the addons website, but for some reason webRequest doesn't perform this check.

At this point, the original reasons for blocking extension scripts on AMO no longer hold. The original prohibition was mainly due to the fact that the mozAddonManager API allowed it to install extensions without any user confirmation. The current API only allows the ability to list installed extensions, and to install without the second xpinstall whitelist prompt.
At this point, I think this bug should be rated sec-moderate at best, at least as far as AMO is concerned. As far as its relationship to [bug 1415644](/show_bug.cgi?id=1415644 "RESOLVED FIXED - Should extensions get access to accounts.firefox.com") is concerned, if that bug is sec-high and the bug allowed extensions to bypass the same restrictions for those sites, I suppose this bug should be treated as sec-high too.
I can't say for sure whether I would have fixed that loophole in the process of fixing bug [bug 1415644](/show_bug.cgi?id=1415644 "RESOLVED FIXED - Should extensions get access to accounts.firefox.com") if this bug hadn't been filed. Although I suspect that in the process of fixing [bug 1444539](/show_bug.cgi?id=1444539 "RESOLVED FIXED - Response filters should not persist across redirects"), at least, I would have.

(In reply to Kris Maglione [:kmag] (long backlog; ping on IRC if you're blocked) from [comment #7](/show_bug.cgi?id=1427289#c7 "VERIFIED FIXED - Executing JS on addons.mozilla.org using webRequestBlocking"))

There seems to be an exception somewhere to this rule.
on testpilot domain we can execute the following:
navigator.mozAddonManager.createInstall({
url: "[https://testpilot.firefox.com/files/@testpilot-addon/signed-addon.xpi](https://testpilot.firefox.com/files/%40testpilot-addon/signed-addon.xpi)"
}).then(function(e){e.install().then(function(){})})
and the 'legacy' addon is installed automatically. I wonder if this bug could be hypothetically used to intercept the XPI, but probably not since I have no idea how the signing and verification methods work. Will test later (unless someone with more knowledge tells me its impossible)

We never showed pre-install confirmations for legacy extensions, this was an explicit decision from product (or UX?), we had some back-and-forth about it but they were pretty firm. We do show a post-install notification for legacy extensions.
Of course, legacy extensions need to be specially signed to run on release or beta, there are a dwindling number of these that still exist and we should be down to zero some time this year. And nightly/devedition users who have flipped the extensions.legacy.enabled preference may still install legacy extensions. But again, if somebody did manage to exploit this, they could only install a signed legacy extension from AMO and the user would still see a post-install notification.

Well feel free to poke at it, but if if you manage to modify the XPI and not break the signature verification in the process, that would be a separate bug with the signing system.Flags: needinfo?(aswan)

Which can easily be circumvented via webextension api's by closing the tab or window (and opening a new one).

I still wouldn't rate this more than sec-moderate at this point.
The original problem was that an extension could be installed with few-to-no visible permissions and then silently install another extension (possibly created by the same author) to get whatever elevated privileges it wanted. At this point, any WebExtension with elevated privileges would trigger a permission prompt that the user would have to accept.
A Mozilla-signed legacy extension would not trigger a permission prompt, but there are only a few of those in existence, they can't be generally created, and they don't trigger permission prompts on install, anyway. Having an extension silently install them is annoying, but not a serious privilege escalation.
If you can find a Mozilla-signed extension that would allow a WebExtension to gain elevated privileges when installed, I may reconsider, but for now, I still consider this bug only moderate.

# USN-3645-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

11 May 2018

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application

crash, bypass same-origin restrictions, conduct cross-site scripting (XSS)

attacks, install lightweight themes without user interaction, spoof the

filename in the downloads panel, or execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-5150](/security/CVE-2018-5150), [CVE-2018-5151](/security/CVE-2018-5151), [CVE-2018-5153](/security/CVE-2018-5153), [CVE-2018-5154](/security/CVE-2018-5154),

[CVE-2018-5177](/security/CVE-2018-5177), [CVE-2018-5180](/security/CVE-2018-5180))

Multiple security issues were discovered with WebExtensions. If a user

were tricked in to installing a specially crafted extension, an attacker

could potentially exploit these to obtain sensitive information, or bypass

security restrictions. ([CVE-2018-5152](/security/CVE-2018-5152), [CVE-2018-5166](/security/CVE-2018-5166))

It was discovered that the web console and JavaScript debugger incorrectly

linkified chrome: and javascript URLs. If a user were tricked in to

clicking a specially crafted link, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. ([CVE-2018-5167](/security/CVE-2018-5167))

It was discovered that dragging and dropping link text on to the home

button could set the home page to include chrome pages. If a user were

tricked in to dragging and dropping a specially crafted link on to the

home button, an attacker could potentially exploit this bypass security

restrictions. ([CVE-2018-5169](/security/CVE-2018-5169))

It was discovered that the Live Bookmarks page and PDF viewer would run

script pasted from the clipboard. If a user were tricked in to copying and

pasting specially crafted text, an attacker could potentially exploit this

to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. ([CVE-2018-5172](/security/CVE-2018-5172))

It was discovered that the JSON viewer incorrectly linkified javascript:

URLs. If a user were tricked in to clicking on a specially crafted link,

an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information. ([CVE-2018-5176](/security/CVE-2018-5176))

It was discovered that dragging a file: URL on to a tab that is running in

a different process would cause the file to open in that process. If a

user were tricked in to dragging a file: URL, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to bypass intended security policies.

([CVE-2018-5181](/security/CVE-2018-5181))

It was discovered that dragging text that is a file: URL on to the

addressbar would open the specified file. If a user were tricked in to

dragging specially crafted text on to the addressbar, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to bypass intended security policies.

([CVE-2018-5182](/security/CVE-2018-5182))

[Test HTML page that reproduces the problem. Edit the server URL to point to a websockets endpoint. Then pick a small text file to send. Debugging messages are displayed to the console.](attachment.cgi?id=8949513)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8949513&action=edit)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:59.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/59.0
Build ID: 20180205211730
Steps to reproduce:
Sent a websocket message that was composed of text and binary data concatenated into a single blob. To see the problem, text data must be before the binary data.
Actual results:
On Firefox 58+, the binary data gets corrupted. If you open the attached HTML file, and pick a file. The websocket message that gets sent looks like this:
<header>ееееееееееееееееее
"<header>" is the text part of the message. "eeeeeeee...." is the binary data that should be the content of the file. Each binary byte has been replaced by an "e".
Expected results:
On earlier versions of Firefox (<58) and other browsers (IE & Chrome) the websocket message looks like this:
<header>text file content.

Other items of note:
I have included a workaround in the attached HTML file. By sending a single byte of the file data before the text data the problem does not appear. Just search for "workaround" and swap in the commented out line.
The blob that I am passing to websocket.send() looks fine, but the data that is sent is corrupted. The attached HTML file prints each byte of the blob (in numeric and character form) to the web browser console before the websocket message is sent.
For a webserver I am using JBoss (Wildfly 10). Using annotations in a Java class I have setup a websockets endpoint that takes the websocket messages and writes them to files. Let me know if this code would be helpful to have.

Attached patch

[patch](attachment.cgi?id=8964066&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8964066&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1436809&attachment=8964066)

This is a regression caused by [bug 1415081](/show_bug.cgi?id=1415081 "RESOLVED FIXED - Sending big in-memory blobs to WebSocket makes FF to crash or fail"). NS\_ReadInputStreamToString doesn't read all bytes because the input stream is nsMultiplexInputStream and the second part is stored in SlicedInputStream which doesn't implement ReadSegments. The result is that we go beyond the buffer end and we send a random data from memory to the server.
This patch doesn't fix NS\_ReadInputStreamToString, it just adds a check to OutboundMessage::ConvertStreamToString() so we abort the connection when all data wasn't converted.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
This seems more likely to be a bug in nsMultiplexInputStream and in SlicedInputStream.
1. for nsMultiplexInputStream the bug is here: <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/xpcom/io/nsMultiplexInputStream.cpp#428-430,446> because we don't propagate the ReadSegments() error.
2. For SlicedInputStream, if we need to implement ReadSegments, let's do it.
The proposed patch seems just a way to hide the bug.

Although it's not clearly stated in nsIInputStream.idl, the general rule IMHO is that Read/ReadSegments returns success if some data was read. So the code in nsMultiplexInputStream seems to be correct.
> 2. For SlicedInputStream, if we need to implement ReadSegments, let's do it.
Agree, implementing SlicedInputStream::ReadSegments() will fix this bug so that the message will be correctly sent.
> The proposed patch seems just a way to hide the bug.
I don't agree. If we fix SlicedInputStream then nsMultiplexInputStream can fail on other input stream type. If we fix nsMultiplexInputStream then NS\_ReadInputStreamToString can read the data from other buggy input stream type. So I think we have to check how many bytes were read by NS\_ReadInputStreamToString.

I agree with Michal; we really need this check.
We should also try to implement SlicedInputStream::ReadSegments() in a follow-up bug.
I'd also like to see a test for this bug added, so we don't regress in the future.

Attached patch

[patch v2 - removed checkin comment that tells how to exploit the bug](attachment.cgi?id=8964107&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8964107&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1436809&attachment=8964107)

[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
The exploit is easy to make.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
A test would point to the problem, so we should land some test later.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
58 and newer versions
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
[bug 1415081](/show_bug.cgi?id=1415081 "RESOLVED FIXED - Sending big in-memory blobs to WebSocket makes FF to crash or fail")
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
Trivial to backport if needed, but the patch should probably apply cleanly as is.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Very unlikely, no special testing should be needed.

The test should probably land together with the fix of SlicedInputStream. In any case, the test should land after this fix is in the release.

We should file a follow-up bug to implement this.
The patch should also MOZ\_DIAGNOSTIC\_ASSERT that temp->Length() == mLength so we don't just silently ignore this problem in the future.

There is no bug for it yet. I have a patch, but it doesn't help because the underlying stream doesn't implement it either <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/5ff2d7683078c96e4b11b8a13674daded935aa44/netwerk/base/nsFileStreams.cpp#221>
Looks like the best solution here is to use Read instead of ReagSegments at <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/5ff2d7683078c96e4b11b8a13674daded935aa44/netwerk/base/nsNetUtil.cpp#1631>.

In theory, BufferWriter::Write() checks if the stream is buffered: NS\_InputStreamIsBuffered(). If that is not the case, NS\_NewBufferedInputStream is used to wrap the underlying stream. BufferedStream implements ReadSegments().
But NS\_InputStreamIsBuffered() checks if ReadSegments() works reading 1 byte only. This doesn't work for nsMultiplexInputStream because maybe just 1 of the sub streams doesn't support ReadSegments() and, if that one is not the first stream, NS\_InputStreamIsBuffered() will not detect it.
Here my proposal:
1. NS\_InputStreamIsBuffered() should QI the inputStream to see if it implements nsIMultiplexInputStream.
2. if it does, it calls NS\_InputStreamIsBuffered() on each substream. When one of them fails, it returns false.Flags: needinfo?(amarchesini)

This won't work when nsMultiplexInputStream is hidden behind some other stream. Let's say I'll land the ReadSegments implementation of SlicedInputStream, then we can have something like this:
sliced stream -> muxed stream -> ( string stream + file input stream )
This passes the test but fails to read.

Right. Probably the best way to do this is to introduce a new interface and use it to know if the stream supports ReadSegments(). The cleanest way would be to move ReadSegments() in a separate interface. Each 'meta' stream should expose such interface only if the underlying stream(s) supports that too.
A similar approach has been done for nsIAsyncInputStream and other interfaces in SlicedInputStream, Multiplex, MIME and so on.

There are a lot of stream interfaces--we're wondering if we could just hack around this for now by detecting the failure in bufferwriter when we try to readSeg, then fall back to seeking the streams back to 0 and using the slow Read() path (i.e. read w/o using ReadSegements).
Baku, does that hack sound OK?Flags: needinfo?(amarchesini)

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=1415644#c0)• 7 years ago |
|  | |

Currently WebExtensions can attach content scripts to accounts.firefox.com and listen to traffic using the webRequest API. That means an extension could intercept your user name and password for that site.
If an extension did that, then the argument is that then the extension would have access to all the data stored in the sync backend. That might be your complete browsing history, for example.
To do this an extension needs to ask for permission to accounts.firefox.com specifically, or <all\_urls>. We are potentially asking the user to make the leap that access to <all\_urls> might mean "all my browsing history" I've synced.
The developer could get access to this by asking for the history API, for example, but that warns the user (hopefully clearly) that they've asked for this.
This assumes that getting access to accounts.firefox.com means that a malicious extension can get access to the browsing history... so cc'ing rkelly for that. Pinging jkt for the security view of this.

To be clear, the password doesn't transit the wire in plaintext, they'd have to get it directly out of the password field in the DOM.

But intercepting what's on the wire is sufficient to login to the user's account and run cracking attacks if they've chosen a weak password.

Note that extensions aren't the same as packet sniffers, they can use requestBody to get the unencrypted payload of a POST.
But ... an extension can do the same on google.com or facebook.com or whatever to swipe other valuable credentials. I don't think we should treat something differently just because we operate it unless we have a really specific and compelling reason to do so.

Just to check, I found I couldn't examine the requests made by the sync process to the server using webRequest. We specifically made the decision that system requests are not examinable by webRequest in [bug 1279371](/show_bug.cgi?id=1279371 "RESOLVED FIXED - chrome.webRequest events have not occur with service request, but it is not documented") and others. However if I open a tab to accounts.firefox.com, or go to about:preferences#sync and sign in, the traffic is observable in webRequest.
The argument here, is that the storing of all your history and bookmarks on a Mozilla server is a feature of Firefox. And hence different from Google or Facebook.

I feel like we had an older bug where some of this stuff was discussed; :vladikoff do you recall?
The counterpoint is that users might reasonably expect e.g. a password-manager addon to work correctly on accounts.firefox.com, and I don't know whether we can enumerate a set of "safe" capabilities to expose that would allow this, without allowing more general access.Flags: needinfo?(vlad)

I don't know all the capabilities of accounts.firefox.com but here is what I know:
It has the following I do know of:
- Info:
- Username, password
- Other info: picture etc
- Devices linked
- Delete account
Which aren't problematic really other than annoying if exploited.
However given an extension could sniff credentials, then use these to modify what extensions a user has installed on sync. This would be considered an escape hatch on the current permission model.
I would personally suggest this should be restricted unless we have a clear use-case for not.
Even then I would suggest having a new keyword for restricted urls like: <possibly\_insecure> which initially could be used internally by Mozilla signed extensions.
> I don't know whether we can enumerate a set of "safe" capabilities to expose that would allow this, without allowing more general access.
I don't think there is an alternative here either.Flags: needinfo?(wleung)

Oh yes, this is a really good point that I frequently forget about: if you can write data into sync for a user, you can change their list of synced addons, causing new webextensions to be installed.

Installing potentially malicious addon X to force an install of potentially malicious addon Y isn't that useful. Do the malicious work in addon X instead.
If I had access to your sync data, I'd look for the bookmark that points to your bank and rewrite it to my phishing site instead.

- I could ask for only \*.firefox.com and gain any permission without ever asking for it
- Native messaging, <all\_urls>, proxy are the areas I was thinking of
- I could replace existing extensions with fake ones too
- I suspect this exploit could be done with just active tab too

Arguably, if we don't trust users are checking permissions then an extension could do this also with "bookmarks" and "history" too.

Let's not make the assumption that users aren't reading the permissions because then everything is moot and we can all just go home, or to the pub.

I agree, I was inferring this from your previous statement:
> Installing potentially malicious addon X to force an install of potentially malicious addon Y isn't that useful. Do the malicious work in addon X instead.
If a user is checking the permissions they would see "active tab" permissions requested which results in their whole history/bookmarks/addons compromised.
I think we are in agreement here that this should be blocked.

In hindsight, I really should have made [bug 1361953](/show_bug.cgi?id=1361953 "RESOLVED FIXED - Consider preventing Web Extensions interacting with privileged Firefox web URLs") a higher risk or chased this more - I was very surprised that it was still open, I thought we had found a clear resolution there. But on reflection, this isn't an easy problem to solve.
We need to do something here and it needs to be holistic. I've been doing some testing of accounts.ifirefox.com with an extensions with the <all\_urls>, webRequest & webRequestBlocking permissions. With these three, a malicious extension can (for example):
\* remove the CSP for accounts.ifirefox.com
\* use location: to redirect resources (this would allow redirection of script resources, were it not for SRI)
\* read the Authorization header on API requests (and thus spoof sync API requests)
\* set fake CORS header so that accounts can be scraped (don't think that gives much in this case)
I'm worried we are just going to end up playing whack-a-mole here though. For example, consider all of the following which can be intercepted currently:
sync.services.mozilla.com
addons.cdn.mozilla.net
accounts-static.cdn.mozilla.net
api.accounts.firefox.com
oauth.accounts.firefox.com
profile.accounts.firefox.com
... etc
This seems like a problem waiting to happen. I at a bit of a loss on how to approach this, since I am not aware of a canonical list of subdomains and services that we need to protect here. And then what about services added in the future? I'm going to continue testing, and also talk to the folks (ekr and ckershb) who are looking at rationalise the privileges in Firefox front-end.
But if anyone can add more information here, i'm all ears.Flags: needinfo?(ptheriault)

Maybe this: [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1258135](/show_bug.cgi?id=1258135 "RESOLVED FIXED - ff fails to remember login for accounts.firefox.com") but there could more.

This is one of the downsides of using website UI rather than building it into the client (even if the implementation does an XHR/fetch and builds the UI client-side). We can protect special pages like about: from web extensions (but not from legacy add-ons, of course). See [bug 1034526](/show_bug.cgi?id=1034526 "NEW - New Sync should have an option to encrypt data with a secret that's not used for anything else and never entered into a Web page") and bugs duped to it.
We have the same problem with AMO. On the one had it's a website and it looks bad to prevent extensions from "enhancing" it like any other site ("favoritism!!"). On the other hand the original favoritism sin was giving that site extra powers in the first place, so that extensions abusing it were much worse than abusing a regular web page. We've really got to stop giving our own web pages magic powers.
Two bad choices: prevent legit extensions from doing helpful stuff on that site, or live with normal extensions (asking to modify all pages is common) having much more actual power than they realize. Given the choice I'd block extensions from mucking with FxA pages. When enough people complain that it's worth rewriting that functionality to have less power then we can unblock it.Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)

accounts.firefox.com does have access to webChannels but note that the main "attack" described in this bug is stealing credentials from the login page on accounts.firefox.com, which would be an issue even if webChannels were stripped away.

The inverse attack is also possible, a kind of login fixation: a malicious addon could inject scripts into accounts.firefox.com, fire some webchannel messages to sign the browser in to sync with an account under the attacker's control, and then snoop on whatever data the victim's browser syncs to that account.

It's also worth considering explicitly: what measures, if any, does Google take to prevent a Chrome extension from stealing your Google account password? I wasn't able to find any explicit information on this topic from a bit of searching around.

In the past they haven't, but I haven't checked recently. One consequence of preventing add-on access to accounts.firefox.com is that third-party password managers would not be able to automatically capture and fill on accounts.firefox.com.
My motivator for originally raising this with Andy was this update: <https://dev.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/quarterly-updates>
Site Isolation
"Running an experiment in M63 to give process isolation to accounts.google.com, to improve Chrome Signin security."
Granted, it's not this issue exactly, but it made me think about what isolation we maybe should be providing in Firefox for Firefox Accounts that we're currently not.

It sounds like the main loss here is losing the ability for password managers to help with the Firefox Account login. At this point I think that's probably worth the loss in functionality for the possible security problems that could result. Marking as a P2 and we'll aim to get this done in the 59 or 60 cycle (more likely 60 at this point). If anyone has any concerns that about, please let me know.Priority: -- → P2

So what are you explicitly planning to do here? Note that just blocking accounts.mozilla.com is not enough to mitigate risk here - we need to prevent access to all the domains I mentioned in [comment 13](/show_bug.cgi?id=1415644#c13 "RESOLVED FIXED - Should extensions get access to accounts.firefox.com"), and probably others. If nothing else, the authorization header sent to sync.services.mozilla.com almost as sensitive as the user's password.
I don't have a canonical list currently, but I am working on a project with Christoph Kerschbaumer to try to enumerate all the semi-privileged origins in Firefox (included all the web pages with access to chrome features via various event/message passing APIs). Needinfo'ing myself to follow-up once we have that list.
I'm also wondering if WebRequest is the only threat here (cookies API? Others?)

[WIP patch covering WebRequest and ContentScripts](attachment.cgi?id=8931902&action=diff) (obsolete)

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1415644&attachment=8931902)

The patch submitted creates a new list provided from these conversations however I think the controls of these functionality should be moved to:
<https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/app/permissions>
The problem being is some of these issues are just because they accept password input which doesn't have restricted APIs. This poses an issue in itself as we need to maintain this list somewhere as Paul mentioned.
Also this bug fixes an issue where "privacy.resistFingerprinting.block\_mozAddonManager" actually allows content scripts on addons.mozilla.org due to the removal of the addon manager API.

It would be nice if we could unify this in the code somehow. The biggest problem I have with the patch above is it's a list that will get out of date easily.
If you have the ability to test some of the exploits you are worried about with that patch or provide some STRs this would be super helpful.
Do we also care about crash reporting being a vector here?

At a minimum we need a something configurable - I think the list of domains you have here should be a pref, that so we can maintain it without changing code.

Well its not really exploits. It's just using the APIs as they are intended but on sensitive domains. The testing I have done so far has just been writing my own addons. But we really need automated tests to make sure we don't regress this. If you are asking "what are all the things we need to block?" I will post that as an attachment, since I have a list but I dont think its complete yet (basically just from the security model: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u3IoSbMlMts_dZYkbQEXYY2VNOewTinpXtFCeEYdboo/edit>#)
>
> Do we also care about crash reporting being a vector here?
I don't know how this is related ? Oh you mean should we stop extensions messing with crash reports? Yes we should, but I think we already do. Im not sure what the terminology is but I believe all network request initiated from chrome bypass the WebRequest API. (I've heard these called 'system requests'Blocks: [1425197](/show_bug.cgi?id=1425197 "RESOLVED FIXED - browser.devtools.inspectedWindow.eval isn't blocked on addons.mozilla.org")Flags: needinfo?(ptheriault)

So as for a proposal I think we need a preference which contains a blacklist of semi-privileged domains which we want to forbid extensions to have access to. And then we need a consistent approach for forbid access. The APIs and features that I am aware that need to take these semi-privileged domains into account. ( Andrew, Kris, others, please review this, this is best effort from my understanding of the code that I have reviewed).
1. Manifest Attributes
- Host Permissions
- must no be able to request a URL that matches the blacklist [1]
- <all\_urls> must not include the blacklist
- "matches" parameter of content\_scripts manifest key must follow the same behavior as host permission
2. APIs which respect host permissions (ie should not be allowed on blacklisted domain)
tabs.executeScript
contentScripts.register
WebRequest & WebRequestBlocking
cookies
activeTab MUST NOT grant access on semi-privileged domains
3. Sensitive APIs which are currently an issue
Proxy API - this basically does the same thing as web request, but its not origin bound.
Devtools - this currently can interact in a variety of ways including injecting script (see [bug 1425197](/show_bug.cgi?id=1425197 "RESOLVED FIXED - browser.devtools.inspectedWindow.eval isn't blocked on addons.mozilla.org"))

I think at least for now silently failing is fine. Especially as assume we decide mozilla.org or newsite.pocket.com is banned for extension compat, just breaking the script rather than breaking install is likely better.
I still have much more testing to do, we likely will want a test for each of these scenarios highlighted by Paul in [Comment 25](/show_bug.cgi?id=1415644#c25 "RESOLVED FIXED - Should extensions get access to accounts.firefox.com").

Reviewing :jkt patch (<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8949037&action=diff>) I could tell that it will not cover every cases.
The problem is not limited to semi-privileged related to mozilla URL. It is related to any Firefox feature running in privileged mode that is performing actions based on the informations exchanged with a remote server. For example, one could set up its own Firefox Account Server. Applying the proposed patch will obviously no prevent an extension to eavesdrop or spoofing sync data with a privately owned server.
In short term it could do it to minimize risk but in the end another solution should be put inplace.
A solution that I could think of for long term is having a "firefox privileged url" type for preferences. Then extension limitations should be applied to every URL flagged as "firefox privileged url". To enable this, one would have to go though all url used by privileged components to flag them as such.
Note:
- On a side note, considering introducing other types for preferences could be a good thng form a security perspective. For example, preference that are meant to have JSON in it could not be set to invalid JSON so that an attacker could exploit an error mishandling.

FLR: That seems out of scope here, we aren't trying to catch all internal browser calls to third party URLs. Granted we might want to consider that for a different bug especially for Tor users wishing to ensure the browser can't be intercepted to other calls. My understanding is Browser context calls are restricted from extensions in most cases anyway.
The scope of this bug actually is more about non privileged calls from content pages to URLs that have more permissions within the browser via other means. So accounts.firefox.com can allow the extension to modify the users sync account and escalate privileges etc. Given we are now using the pref, if there is a way for a user to sync to a different URL, we could edit the pref within the browser too.

Hey so unfortunately I won't be able to continue to work on this, I wrapped up the patch so that I think it could be continued to work on or just merge as is.
There isn't as many tests as I would like here but it feels pretty urgent to cover all the cases that Paul highlighted.
I hit some road bumps that really slowed me down here:
- xpcshell tests I couldn't get to work with a different hostname (mozilla.org), I added a new identity but it didn't proxy locally as I would have expected elsewhere.
- The pref isn't live which perhaps isn't a problem in product, however it makes testing pretty hard.
I need to move onto something else but I want to ensure this doesn't bitrot. Even if this doesn't cover all cases I think the patch is worth dropping in given the risks here.

Sorry for redirection but Shane should probably take a look at the webrequest bits.
This could use a test, as it is complete broken right now due to typo in the pref name...
Much more importantly though, is this really maintainable? How are we going to keep this list updated? Do new services that use Firefox accounts have to get a change to this pref shipped before they can be deployed?

DDurst pinged me about this one. They'd like to see this fix land in ESR60. Adding a 60+ tracking flag to ensure it gets closer monitoring by relman team.

Perhaps we can try (post-release) to tie the list to the intercepted requests / preffed-to-localhost domains in test prefs?

Comparing to the default permissions in <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/app/permissions> would also be helpful to catch new privileged origins.

Assuming you're talking about build/pgo/server-locations.txt I'm not seeing a connection, there's not much overlap between the list of hosts in the attached patch and the contents of that file...

Yeah, this would help us catch (some) sites to which the browser grants extra privileges but my understanding is that the patch attached here tries to enumerate all the domains that use Firefox accounts. Most of those sites don't have any special access to browser features, they just happen to use fxa for authentication. Relying on the browser having a complete and up-to-date list of such sites sounds like something almost guaranteed to fail.

Create a list of restricted domains
Looks reasonable for what its doing. While existing tests should cover most of this, I'd still like to see the test patch ready before landing since there are some differences (e.g. pref change support, lack of requestBody for our special flavour of website). I kind of question the pref observer...do we expect the restrictedDomains list to be modified at runtime, if so how is that happening (ie. do we intend to do hotfixes to update this or something)?

Maybe its best to have somebody with stronger c++ chops take a look at this, but doesn't this keep referencing (but never unrefing) the underlying AtomSet?

If you mean AddRefing, no, AtomSet is not refcounted. Get() returns a reference to the instance that is owned by the AtomSetPref.

Create a list of restricted domains
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Not terribly easily. It contains a list of interesting domains that a malicious extension might try to extract Mozilla services API/auth tokens from, but it doesn't suggest any particular reason that accessing those domains might be interesting.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
No.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All.
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
No. It would not be hard to backport to 59 release, but it also would not be worth the risk.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Not very likely. It should only affect extensions which access certain internal Mozilla domains, most of which are CDNs or API endpoints. Several of them already have restricted access, so the likelihood of this breaking legitimate production extensions is fairly low.

Just wondering, wouldn't it be better if sub domains of the restricted domain list were also considered as restricted ?

Perhaps, but that check would be much more expensive.

I didn't understand the nature of the mechanism you added. The attack I was thinking of was intercepting the loading of a script that is included on AMO. I assumed that for WebRequest, the blocking would be done on the request's URL, and thus intercepting google analytics on AMO would still be allowed (since it isn't on the blacklist). But I see from testing the check is on the URL of the document which triggered the request (is that correct?).
I was also concerned that if you intercepted google analytics on a different domain, you could poison the cache for AMO. But as far as I can from testing, modifications made by filterResponseData are not stored in the cache (as far as I can tell, only the original response is cached, not the modified one? Is that correct?).
So from what I can tell, any domain in this restricted list:
- can not have a content script injected into it (via manifest, contentScripts.register() or tabs.executeScript())
- webRequest events will not be sent for tabs with a document that matches one of the blocked domains
- can not use Devtools API to inject script (browser.devtools.inspectedWindow.eval)
Is my understanding correct? I've added this to the security model document [1]. Please let me know if Ive misunderstood anything here.
Note that one API that lives outside these restrictions is the Proxy API. This make sense I think: Proxy can already be used to intercept any URL, including system requests (like update requests etc)- which makes sense, otherwise it would break the usefulness of being able to set the network proxy. But our add-on review team should probably be aware of the sensitive nature of the Proxy permission.

So, there are a few different sets of restrictions here:
- Extensions cannot see requests unless they have permissions for the domains of
both the requested URL and for the document requesting the URL. As of this bug,
that check also takes into account the restricted domains list.
- Extensions cannot modify requests if they don't have permission to see them,
per the above, or if the document the request belongs to has access to the
mozAddonManager API. As of this bug, this restriction also applies to the
StreamFilter API.
- Extensions cannot load content scripts into any domain that they do not have
host permissions for, any site that has access to the mozAddonManager API, or,
as of this bug, any domain on the restricted domains list.
- Extensions cannot make non-CORS requests to any domain they do not have host
permissions for or, as of this bug, any domain on the restricted domains list.
They can still make requests to domains with mozAddonManager access as long as
they are not also on the restricted domains list (which I believe they all are).
The behavior introduced by this bug is less lenient, since one of the concerns
was the possibility of getting access to Firefox Accounts tokens. We didn't have
that concern when restricting access to the mozAddonManager API.

I'm not especially concerned about the proxy API here. The sites that we're
restricting access to here, and all of the resources they load, should only be
accessible over HTTPS. Unless the proxy they're being forwarded to has a trusted
certificate for those sites, they shouldn't be able to cause any problems beyond
DOS. If they do have access to trusted certificates for those sites, we have
bigger problems.
