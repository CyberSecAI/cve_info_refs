The provided content describes a vulnerability in the SrbTransLatin WordPress plugin, which is distinct from the described CVE. The content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability, while CVE-2018-5368 is a placeholder. Therefore, the content is not related to CVE-2018-5368.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `lang_identificator` parameter in the SrbTransLatin plugin settings page is not properly sanitized, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.
- The plugin lacks CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to trick an admin into performing unwanted actions via a crafted HTML page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS: Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the `lang_identificator` parameter and stored in the plugin's settings, which will then be executed in the admin's browser when the settings page is accessed
- CSRF: The absence of CSRF tokens allows an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated admin user.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- XSS: Allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the admin's browser, potentially stealing cookies, redirecting to malicious sites, or performing other actions on behalf of the admin.
- CSRF: When combined with XSS, allows attacker to perform actions as the admin, like changing settings or creating a new admin user.

**Attack vectors:**
- XSS: The attacker injects the malicious payload through the `lang_identificator` parameter in the plugin settings page.
- CSRF: The attacker crafts an HTML page with a form that submits a malicious request to the plugin's settings page, and tricks the admin into visiting it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- For XSS, the attacker needs to be able to submit a crafted payload to the `lang_identificator` parameter
- For CSRF, the attacker needs to be able to create a malicious web page that includes a form to trigger the exploit.  The attacker needs to trick an authenticated administrator into visiting their malicious page.
