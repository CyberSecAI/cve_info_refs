# BMO

From MozillaWiki

[Jump to navigation](#mw-head)
[Jump to search](#searchInput)

This is the main public page for all things related to <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org>, aka BMO, Mozilla's customized version of [Bugzilla](http://www.bugzilla.org).

BMO is a core piece of infrastructure at Mozilla. It is used to track not only bugs and feature requests but also many other tasks across various teams.

The BMO source is a slightly modified fork of Bugzilla with many custom extensions. It is currently based on Bugzilla 4.2 but with many features backported from 4.4 and master. All the BMO devs are also involved in the Bugzilla project, and we contribute features and fixes upstream where they are generally applicable, that is, not too specific to Mozilla's particular needs.

Updates are usually deployed on a weekly basis and are listed on the [Recent Changes](/BMO/Recent_Changes "BMO/Recent Changes") page.

# B-Team

The team that works on BMO is called the B-Team, because of past affiliation with the defunct Automation and Tools team (A-Team).

* dkl: Dave Lawrence (Owner/Engineer)
* glob (Manager)

The Low-level, security, and quality tools team contributes tooling, and development:

* calixte: Calixte Denizet, (AutoNag)
* marco: Marco Castelluccio, (BugBug)

We also also have some volunteers, that we consider to be part of the B-Team as well:

* seban: Sebastin Santy (long-term volunteer, past GSoC student)
* atoll: Richard Solderberg (Reviewer-at-Large, slightly borrowed from Mozilla IT)
* kohei: Kohei Yoshino, (UX Designer)
* *... and you can be one too!*

There are also some people that still have some involvement with BMO,
but their day-to-day attention is directed to other parts of Mozilla.

* zeid: Zeid Zabaneh (Engineer)

Past contributors include:

* mary: Mary Umoh (Intern, Summer 2017)
* gerv: Gervase Markham
* mcote: Mark Côté
* dylan: Dylan Hardison
* imadueme: Israel Madueme (Engineer)
* justdave: Dave Miller
* emceeaich: Emma Humphries, (Bugmaster)
* mhentges: Mitchell Hentges (Engineer)

# New Users

Getting used to Bugzilla can be a bit daunting. We have a short [introductory video](https://gerv.makes.org/popcorn/1bn6) available that is as gentle as possible. You may also be interested in the [[MDN section about Bugzilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Bugzilla)], which contains information more suitable as an introduction to a general audience. Of special interest is the MDN article, [What to do and what not to do in Bugzilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/What_to_do_and_what_not_to_do_in_Bugzilla), which contains instructions on getting elevated privileges.

# New Bots

If you have a bot that uses BMO, be sure to add it to the [BMO/Bot Registry](/BMO/Bot_Registry "BMO/Bot Registry")
so we know who to contact about it!

# User Guide

We're putting together a [user guide](/BMO/UserGuide "BMO/UserGuide") with helpful information on various aspects of Bugzilla. New and experienced users alike should benefit from it. There's a lot to go through, so please feel free to contribute!

# Road Map

We keep a yearly [road map](/BMO/Road_Map "BMO/Road Map") with our medium-term plans (1-2 years), at a high level. Also see our [current projects](/BMO#Current_Projects "BMO") for some of the big items we are working on in the current quarter.

# Browser Support For BMO

Full Support includes: The current versions of Firefox, Chrome, Chromium, Safari, WebKit, and Edge; and the latest Firefox ESR.

Limited Support includes: The previous versions of Firefox, Chrome, Chromium, Safari, WebKit, Edge, and Firefox ESR; and Firefox Nightly.

Internet Explorer is no longer supported, though some features may still work with IE 11.

See [bug 1359310](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1359310) and [bug 1422435](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1422435).

## JavaScript and Analytics

JavaScript is required to use bugzilla.mozilla.org.

The `Do Not Track` header sent by your browser is honored.

# Third-Party Applications

Lots and lots of web apps and general tools have been written to interface with BMO. We have started [cataloguing them](/BMO/ThirdPartyApps "BMO/ThirdPartyApps"). If you're looking for different ways to interface with BMO, check it out; similarly, if you are thinking about writing an app, check the catalogue to see if something similar exists that you could use, contribute to, or fork before setting out on your own.

There's one in particular that is particularly important: [Phabricator](https://moz-conduit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/phabricator-user.html), Mozilla's new and growing code-review tool.

# More Information about BMO

Our discussion forum is mozilla.tools.bmo [[mailing list](https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/tools-bmo)] [[Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mozilla.tools.bmo)] [USENET].

We also have answers to [Frequently Asked Questions](/BMO/FAQ "BMO/FAQ") and a slightly-but-not-too-out-of-date [hardware diagram](http://people.mozilla.org/~justdave/BugzillaPhysicalDiagram-rev110504.png).

If you're building an application or tool that interfaces with BMO, you may be interested in the following:

* [Best practices and etiquette](/BMO/Integration_Best_Practice "BMO/Integration Best Practice") for integrating external apps with BMO
* Info and plans on Bugzilla's [REST API](/Bugzilla%3AREST_API "Bugzilla:REST API"), and the older, deprecated [BzAPI](/Bugzilla%3ABzAPI "Bugzilla:BzAPI").

# Contributing to BMO

If you'd like to help out with BMO specifically (as opposed to the general upstream [Bugzilla project](/Bugzilla "Bugzilla")), you can find us in #bmo on irc.mozilla.org. If you plan on contributing patches, see the documentation in the [README.rst](https://github.com/mozilla-bteam/bmo/blob/master/README.rst). You can file bugs under the [bugzilla.mozilla.org product](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org). Don't file them under the Bugzilla product unless you are sure it's a bug in the general Bugzilla product. In particular, all administrative changes should be filed under bugzilla.mozilla.org (see below for more).

# Policies and Procedures

## Code Updates

Code updates are normally deployed to bugzilla.mozilla.org late Monday/early Tuesday, US/Pacific time, at no specific time, if changes need to be pushed out. Security fixes or other fatal type errors will always go out as soon as possible.

Updates are usually deployed on a weekly basis and are listed on the [BMO/Recent Changes](/BMO/Recent_Changes "BMO/Recent Changes") page.

## Administrative Changes

If you need changes to BMO's configuration to support your team, project, etc., please consult this page before filing bugs:

* [General information on requesting Changes to BMO](/BMO/Requesting_Changes "BMO/Requesting Changes")

## BMO Administrative Processes

* [Adding a new product](/BMO/new-product "BMO/new-product")
* [Adding a new "rapid release" version](/BMO/new-version "BMO/new-version")
* [Adding a new BMO security group](/BMO/new-security-group "BMO/new-security-group")
* [Retiring Products and Components](/BMO/RetiringComponents "BMO/RetiringComponents"): moving things to the Graveyard classification.
* [Restoring Disabled Accounts](/BMO/RestoringDisabledAccounts "BMO/RestoringDisabledAccounts")
* [Merging Accounts](/index.php?title=BMO/MergingAccounts&action=edit&redlink=1 "BMO/MergingAccounts (page does not exist)")
* [Disabling Accounts](/BMO/DisablingAccounts "BMO/DisablingAccounts")

See also [BMO on Mana](https://mana.mozilla.org/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=45845955) (requires LDAP).

## BMO Development and Other Processes

* [Overall Development Processes](/BMO/Development_Processes "BMO/Development Processes")

* [Planning a BMO outage](/BMO/OutagePlanning "BMO/OutagePlanning")
* [Reset the development branch to master](/BMO/ResetDevelopmentBranch "BMO/ResetDevelopmentBranch")
* [Maintaining Perl Dependencies for BMO](/BMO/Perl_Dependencies "BMO/Perl Dependencies")

## Custom Bug Entry Forms

In the past, BMO developers supported writing custom bug entry forms specific for the needs of different projects and groups within Mozilla. In order to focus more on other important features, we will no longer be providing that support going forward. For more information on why this change was made, see [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.tools.bmo/tp4dSwUfKSA).

There is a new [custom form framework](https://github.com/mozilla-bteam/custom-form-example) being developed by an outside contributor named Sebastin Santy. It is still in the early stages but it eventually will be very useful for users who want to create a customized bug entry form that can be used to submit bugs to BMO.

#### [#CVE-2018-5159: Integer overflow and out-of-bounds write in Skia](#CVE-2018-5159)

Reporter
Ivan Fratric
Impact
high
##### Description

An integer overflow can occur in the Skia library due to 32-bit integer use in an array without integer overflow checks, resulting in possible out-of-bounds writes. This could lead to a potentially exploitable crash triggerable by web content.

#### [#CVE-2018-5160: Uninitialized memory use by WebRTC encoder](#CVE-2018-5160)

Reporter
Andreas Perhson

* [Bug 1436117](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1436117)

#### [#CVE-2018-5152: WebExtensions information leak through webRequest API](#CVE-2018-5152)

Reporter
Andy McKay
Impact
moderate
##### Description

WebExtensions with the appropriate permissions can attach content scripts to Mozilla sites such as accounts.firefox.com and listen to network traffic to the site through the `webRequest` API. For example, this allows for the interception of username and an encrypted password during login to Firefox Accounts. This issue does not expose synchronization traffic directly and is limited to the process of user login to the website and the data displayed to the user once logged in.

#### [#CVE-2018-5163: Replacing cached data in JavaScript Start-up Bytecode Cache](#CVE-2018-5163)

Reporter
Nicolas B. Pierron
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If a malicious attacker has used another vulnerability to gain full control over a content process, they may be able to replace the alternate data resources stored in the JavaScript Start-up Bytecode Cache (JSBC) for other JavaScript code. If the parent process then runs this replaced code, the executed script would be run with the parent process' privileges, escaping the sandbox on content processes.

#### [#CVE-2018-5164: CSP not applied to all multipart content sent with multipart/x-mixed-replace](#CVE-2018-5164)

Reporter
Khalil Zhani
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Content Security Policy (CSP) is not applied correctly to all parts of multipart content sent with the `multipart/x-mixed-replace` MIME type. This could allow for script to run where CSP should block it, allowing for cross-site scripting (XSS) and other attacks.

* [Bug 1416045](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1416045)

#### [#CVE-2018-5166: WebExtension host permission bypass through filterReponseData](#CVE-2018-5166)

Reporter
Francois Lajeunesse Robert
Impact
moderate
##### Description

WebExtensions can use request redirection and a `filterReponseData` filter to bypass host permission settings to redirect network traffic and access content from a host for which they do not have explicit user permission.

* [Bug 1437325](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1437325)

#### [#CVE-2018-5167: Improper linkification of chrome: and javascript: content in web console and JavaScript debugger](#CVE-2018-5167)

Reporter
Wladimir Palant
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The web console and JavaScript debugger do not sanitize all output that can be hyperlinked. Both will display `chrome:` links as active, clickable hyperlinks in their output. Web sites should not be able to directly link to internal chrome pages. Additionally, the JavaScript debugger will display `javascript:` links, which users could be tricked into clicking by malicious sites.

#### [#CVE-2018-5168: Lightweight themes can be installed without user interaction](#CVE-2018-5168)

Reporter
Wladimir Palant
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Sites can bypass security checks on permissions to install lightweight themes by manipulating the `baseURI` property of the theme element. This could allow a malicious site to install a theme without user interaction which could contain offensive or embarrassing images.

* [Bug 1449548](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1449548)

#### [#CVE-2018-5169: Dragging and dropping link text onto home button can set home page to include chrome pages](#CVE-2018-5169)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If manipulated hyperlinked text with `chrome:` URL contained in it is dragged and dropped on the "home" icon, the home page can be reset to include a normally-unlinkable chrome page as one of the home page tabs.

* [Bug 1319157](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1319157)

#### [#CVE-2018-5172: Pasted script from clipboard can run in the Live Bookmarks page or PDF viewer](#CVE-2018-5172)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The Live Bookmarks page and the PDF viewer can run injected script content if a user pastes script from the clipboard into them while viewing RSS feeds or PDF files. This could allow a malicious site to socially engineer a user to copy and paste malicious script content that could then run with the context of either page but does not allow for privilege escalation.

##### References

* [Bug 1436482](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1436482)

#### [#CVE-2018-5173: File name spoofing of Downloads panel with Unicode characters](#CVE-2018-5173)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The filename appearing in the `Downloads` panel improperly renders some Unicode characters, allowing for the file name to be spoofed. This can be used to obscure the file extension of potentially executable files from user view in the panel.
*Note: the dialog to open the file will show the full, correct filename and whether it is executable or not.*

#### [#CVE-2018-5174: Windows Defender SmartScreen UI runs with less secure behavior for downloaded files in Windows 10 April 2018 Update](#CVE-2018-5174)

Reporter
Jimmy
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In the Windows 10 April 2018 Update, Windows Defender SmartScreen honors the `SEE_MASK_FLAG_NO_UI` flag associated with downloaded files and will not show any UI. Files that are unknown and potentially dangerous will be allowed to run because SmartScreen will not prompt the user for a decision, and if the user is offline all files will be allowed to be opened because Windows won’t prompt the user to ask what to do. Firefox incorrectly sets this flag when downloading files, leading to less secure behavior from SmartScreen.
*Note: this issue only affects Windows 10 users running the April 2018 update or later. It does not affect other Windows users or other operating systems.*

#### [#CVE-2018-5175: Universal CSP bypass on sites using strict-dynamic in their policies](#CVE-2018-5175)

Reporter
Masato Kinugawa
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A mechanism to bypass Content Security Policy (CSP) protections on sites that have a `script-src` policy of `'strict-dynamic'`. If a target website contains an HTML injection flaw an attacker could inject a reference to a copy of the `require.js` library that is part of Firefox’s Developer Tools, and then use a known technique using that library to bypass the CSP restrictions on executing injected scripts.

#### [#CVE-2018-5176: JSON Viewer script injection](#CVE-2018-5176)

Reporter
Tadj Youssouf
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The JSON Viewer displays clickable hyperlinks for strings that are parseable as URLs, including `javascript:` links. If a JSON file contains malicious JavaScript script embedded as `javascript:` links, users may be tricked into clicking and running this code in the context of the JSON Viewer. This can allow for the theft of cookies and authorization tokens which are accessible to that context.

#### [#CVE-2018-5177: Buffer overflow in XSLT during number formatting](#CVE-2018-5177)

Reporter
Guyio
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A vulnerability exists in XSLT during number formatting where a negative buffer size may be allocated in some instances, leading to a buffer overflow and crash if it occurs.

#### [#CVE-2018-5165: Checkbox for enabling Flash protected mode is inverted in 32-bit Firefox](#CVE-2018-5165)

Reporter
David Parks
Impact
low
##### Description

In 32-bit versions of Firefox, the Adobe Flash plugin setting for "Enable Adobe Flash protected mode" is unchecked by default even though the Adobe Flash sandbox is actually enabled. The displayed state is the reverse of the true setting, resulting in user confusion. This could cause users to select this setting intending to activate it and inadvertently turn protections off.

* [Bug 1451452](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1451452)

#### [#CVE-2018-5180: heap-use-after-free in mozilla::WebGLContext::DrawElementsInstanced](#CVE-2018-5180)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
low
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur during WebGL operations. While this results in a potentially exploitable crash, the vulnerability is limited because the memory is freed and reused in a brief window of time during the freeing of the same callstack.

* [Bug 1444086](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1444086)

#### [#CVE-2018-5181: Local file can be displayed in noopener tab through drag and drop of hyperlink](#CVE-2018-5181)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
low
##### Description

If a URL using the `file:` protocol is dragged and dropped onto an open tab that is running in a different child process the tab will open a local file corresponding to the dropped URL, contrary to policy. One way to make the target tab open more reliably in a separate process is to open it with the `noopener` keyword.

#### [#CVE-2018-5182: Local file can be displayed from hyperlink dragged and dropped on addressbar](#CVE-2018-5182)

Reporter
Jordi Chancel
Impact
low
##### Description

If a text string that happens to be a filename in the operating system's native format is dragged and dropped onto the addressbar the specified local file will be opened. This is contrary to policy and is what would happen if the string were the equivalent `file:` URL.

#### [#CVE-2018-5179: Service workers can self update to keep a worker running](#CVE-2018-5179)

Reporter
Yannic Bonenberger
Impact
low
##### Description

A service worker can send the "activate" event on itself periodically which allows it to run perpetually. This would allow any malicious activity, such as logging an IP address by the service worker, to occur in the background.

(In reply to Tooru Fujisawa [:arai] from [comment #2](/show_bug.cgi?id=1319157#c2 "RESOLVED FIXED - Home button drop handler should urlSecurityCheck all the links in a pipe (|) separated set of URLs dropped on it"))
> can you describe the attack scenario?
> so that I can test.
If you selected text like this from a webpage:
[http://www.example.com/|chrome://browser/content/](http://www.example.com/%7Cchrome%3A//browser/content/)
and drag it to the home button, it'd set your homepage to 2 tabs, example.com and chrome://browser/content/ .
This shouldn't be allowed, because the web page can't open (link to) chrome://browser/content/ , so neither should it be able to trick you into opening it.
When I looked at dom/base/contentAreaDropListener.js, it looked like it security-checks each URI so will remove ones that you can't link to based on the triggering principal.
Having just actually tested it, it looks like it's still broken, even though I thought this was, at the latest, fixed by [bug 1424107](/show_bug.cgi?id=1424107 "RESOLVED FIXED - Drag and dropping file: URL into new tab with rel=noopener allows opening locally stored files").
I expect the dropped link handler doesn't split on '|' but the home button does. So either the dropped link handler needs to be taught about this, or we stop making this type of multiple-links stuff work in the home button, or we add securitychecking in the home button code itself, or something.Flags: needinfo?(gijskruitbosch+bugs)

Attached patch

[Check each URIs for home button.](attachment.cgi?id=8953057&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8953057&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1319157&attachment=8953057)

To perform extra check on the dropped items, I added nsIDroppedLinkHandler.validateURIsForDrop
that receives the drop event and URIs,
so that we can reuse the code that validates the URIs, in contentAreaDropListener.js.
now homeButtonObserver.onDrop extracts URIs from the dropped text, by splitting them by "|", and check them by nsIDroppedLinkHandler.validateURIsForDrop.Flags: needinfo?(arai.unmht)

This looks OK to me. I don't know that we need to actually show a message to the user. If a user clicks a link to a chrome: URI that we block, we show no user-visible message at all. We just warn in the browser console (SecurityError: so-and-so may not link to so-and-so). I think we could do the same here, but it's up to you.

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

The security checks determining which websites are allowed to install lightweight themes and particularly which are allowed to install them without user's consent are based on the baseURI property of the theme element. Unlike the document URI, this property can be easily manipulated - e.g. by using a <base href="..."> tag. This is what the attached proof of concept page does - opening it will immediately install a theme named "Hacked you" because the security checks consider that page to be discovery.addons.mozilla.org. This is also problematic in light of [bug 527463](/show_bug.cgi?id=527463 "RESOLVED INVALID - Update checks for lightweight themes should not happen for non-whitelisted sites"): a theme might not even change the appearance of Firefox but invisibly track the user via updateURL instead.

Self-nit: should probably call this \_shouldShowUndoPrompt. Also, perhaps it's better off being re-inlined into the 1 callsite. \*shrug\*. Up to y'all what you think is better.

Out of curiosity, how did you find this? I would like us to audit for more mistaken checks here, but it's not clear to me how to go about that - obviously not all uses of 'baseURI' are suspect, and there are rather a lot of them. :-\
Separately, we're already looking at how to do a better job of doing a unified set of security checks for things like this, which would have helped... See also discussion at <https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=&hl=en#!topic/firefox-dev/naSYfA-e2Jw> , for which (coincidentally) there's a meeting later today.Flags: needinfo?(gaubugzilla)

Nothing fancy - I am going through all code interacting with web pages, looking for wrong assumptions. In particular, this means all addEventListener(...,...,...,true) calls.Flags: needinfo?(gaubugzilla)

It gets used to resolve relative URIs in the theme, and nothing else AFAICT. So if the theme specified a background image as 'foo.jpg', it'd get resolved against the base URI defined in the document that specified the lwtheme. I think that's probably fine, and potentially needs to keep doing what it's doing to avoid a case where some webpage hypothetically had:
// on www.foo.com/mythemes/
<base href="mythemeresources/">
<body data-lwthemestuff="... foo.jpg">
because if we use the principal's URI that won't use the baseURI, and so the image URIs won't resolve correctly.
It's an edgecase, but because this isn't technically a security check, I think it's OK.

Once again bitten in the butt by giving special powers to our own web pages.
The actual security damage here is low (easily reset from the addons dialog) but the potential reputational damage could be horrible if script-kiddies weaponize competing offensive images and spread via malicious ads.

I assume you flagged me for the webapi.testing bits, r=me on that.
Between Gijs and mconley I think the baseURI/principal bits have been carefully thought through but if you want another reviewer with a deep enough understanding to spot potential issues, I don't think I have the depth to provide that...

Patch v0.1
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]: n/a
[User impact if declined]: security issue where people can driveby-install lightweight themes
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]: generally yes, in <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/test/general/browser_bug592338.js> .
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]: not yet
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]:
1. open testcase on this bug
2. theme shouldn't automatically install (ie only install after explicit user confirmation in the doorhanger)
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]: n/a
[Is the change risky?]: no
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]: small JS-only change in a feature that we only really use for lwt install/preview on AMO. Also, this is a security fix and we still have quite some beta runway left, so I'm not too worried...
[String changes made/needed]: no

Can do.
[Approval Request Comment]
If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration:
sec-moderate with driveby negative effects for users, relatively simple patch
User impact if declined: security issue.
Fix Landed on Version: 61, uplift to 60
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): relatively low... small-ish JS-only patch, has automated tests for the basics not breaking.
String or UUID changes made by this patch: noneFlags: needinfo?(gijskruitbosch+bugs)

Patch for esr
If kids these days are anything like me and my friends were back in school, [comment 10](/show_bug.cgi?id=1449548#c10 "VERIFIED FIXED - Lightweight themes can be installed automatically, without user's consent") sounds frighteningly plausible in situations where ESR is likely being used. Approved for 52.8.0.

# USN-3645-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

11 May 2018

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application

crash, bypass same-origin restrictions, conduct cross-site scripting (XSS)

attacks, install lightweight themes without user interaction, spoof the

filename in the downloads panel, or execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-5150](/security/CVE-2018-5150), [CVE-2018-5151](/security/CVE-2018-5151), [CVE-2018-5153](/security/CVE-2018-5153), [CVE-2018-5154](/security/CVE-2018-5154),

[CVE-2018-5155](/security/CVE-2018-5155), [CVE-2018-5157](/security/CVE-2018-5157), [CVE-2018-5158](/security/CVE-2018-5158), [CVE-2018-5159](/security/CVE-2018-5159), [CVE-2018-5160](/security/CVE-2018-5160),

[CVE-2018-5163](/security/CVE-2018-5163), [CVE-2018-5164](/security/CVE-2018-5164), [CVE-2018-5168](/security/CVE-2018-5168), [CVE-2018-5173](/security/CVE-2018-5173), [CVE-2018-5175](/security/CVE-2018-5175),

[CVE-2018-5177](/security/CVE-2018-5177), [CVE-2018-5180](/security/CVE-2018-5180))

Multiple security issues were discovered with WebExtensions. If a user

were tricked in to installing a specially crafted extension, an attacker

could potentially exploit these to obtain sensitive information, or bypass

security restrictions. ([CVE-2018-5152](/security/CVE-2018-5152), [CVE-2018-5166](/security/CVE-2018-5166))

It was discovered that the web console and JavaScript debugger incorrectly

linkified chrome: and javascript URLs. If a user were tricked in to

clicking a specially crafted link, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. ([CVE-2018-5167](/security/CVE-2018-5167))

It was discovered that dragging and dropping link text on to the home

button could set the home page to include chrome pages. If a user were

tricked in to dragging and dropping a specially crafted link on to the

home button, an attacker could potentially exploit this bypass security

restrictions. ([CVE-2018-5169](/security/CVE-2018-5169))

It was discovered that the Live Bookmarks page and PDF viewer would run

script pasted from the clipboard. If a user were tricked in to copying and

pasting specially crafted text, an attacker could potentially exploit this

to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. ([CVE-2018-5172](/security/CVE-2018-5172))

It was discovered that the JSON viewer incorrectly linkified javascript:

URLs. If a user were tricked in to clicking on a specially crafted link,

an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information. ([CVE-2018-5176](/security/CVE-2018-5176))

It was discovered that dragging a file: URL on to a tab that is running in

a different process would cause the file to open in that process. If a

user were tricked in to dragging a file: URL, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to bypass intended security policies.

([CVE-2018-5181](/security/CVE-2018-5181))

It was discovered that dragging text that is a file: URL on to the

addressbar would open the specified file. If a user were tricked in to

dragging specially crafted text on to the addressbar, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to bypass intended security policies.

([CVE-2018-5182](/security/CVE-2018-5182))
