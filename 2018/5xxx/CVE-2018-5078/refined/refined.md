The provided content details multiple stored XSS and CSRF vulnerabilities in the "Advanced Real Estate Script."

**XSS Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it on the page. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Lack of input sanitization and output encoding leads to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. This could lead to account hijacking, information theft, or further malicious actions.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   `sitesettings.php`: The `keyword` parameter is vulnerable.
    *   `manageownerlist.php`: The `contact` parameter is vulnerable.
    *   `eventlist.php`: The `cast` parameter is vulnerable.
    *   `movieedit.php`: The `moviename` parameter is vulnerable.
    *   `snacks_edit.php`: The `snacks_name` parameter is vulnerable.
    *   `newsedit.php`: The `newstitle` parameter is vulnerable.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Attacker needs to be able to submit POST requests to the vulnerable endpoints, with malicious payloads in the specified parameters. An authenticated user, likely with admin access, is needed to inject the malicious code.

**CSRF Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The application does not implement proper CSRF protection measures, such as synchronizer tokens or checking the origin header.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Missing CSRF protection allows an attacker to trick a user into making unintended requests by crafting malicious HTML forms or using JavaScript to perform actions on behalf of the victim.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can perform actions on behalf of a logged-in user without their knowledge or consent. This includes changing user details, adding/removing content, or performing sensitive operations.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The provided POC code demonstrates how an attacker can use a crafted HTML page with JavaScript to make a POST request to `movieedit.php` and change the movie name to a malicious payload.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user to load their malicious page, possibly via social engineering or other means.
