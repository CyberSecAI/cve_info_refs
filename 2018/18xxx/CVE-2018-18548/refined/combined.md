**Vulnerable App:**

```
# Title: AjentiCP 1.2.23.13 - Cross-Site Scripting
# Author: Numan OZDEMIR (https://infinitumit.com.tr)
# Vendor Homepage: ajenti.org
# Software Link: https://github.com/ajenti/ajenti
# Version: Up to v1.2.23.13
# CVE: CVE-2018-18548

# Description:

# Attacker can inject JavaScript codes without Ajenti privileges by this
# vulnerabillity.
# Normally an attacker cant intervene to Ajenti without Ajenti privileges.
# But with this vulnerability, if attacker can create a folder (may be by
# a web app vulnerability) he can run
# bad-purposed JavaScript codes on Ajenti user's browser, while the user
# using File Manager tool.
# So this vulnerability makes high risk.

# How to Reproduce:
1)- Create a directory as named xss payload. Like, im<img src onerror=alert(1337)>dir
2)- Open this directory in File Manager tool in Ajenti server admin panel.

```

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Contributing

Helpers are welcome ! There are many ways to help in Ajenti Project :

* [Translations](https://docs.ajenti.org/en/latest/man/contributing.html)
* [Plugin development](https://docs.ajenti.org/en/latest/dev/intro.html)
* [Core development](https://docs.ajenti.org/en/latest/dev/intro-core.html)

## Roadmap

Actually big changes are planned and under development. A global roadmap is :

* ~~Migrating to Python3~~
~~* Migrating to [python-socketio](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/python-socketio)~~* ~~Implement better API REST with @get, @post ... decorators~~
* Migrating from AngularJS to Angular 13 (work in progress):
  + plugins core and dashboard are almost done, but there's a lot of work to migrate all other plugins.
  + This work take actually place in the branch [ajenti-3-dev](https://github.com/ajenti/ajenti/tree/ajenti-3-dev) and the new plugins are stored in the directory [plugins-new](https://github.com/ajenti/ajenti/tree/ajenti-3-dev/plugins-new)
  + The documentation is located at <https://docs.ajenti.org/en/ajenti-3-dev/index.html>
* Add a lot of new plugins: once the migration to Angular done, we can add a lot of plugins to manage services on the server ( like apache2, nginx, postfix, etc ... ).
* Migrating to [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html): concept tested, but migration not really started.

## Sıkça Sorulan Sorular

Tüm sorularınız için +0850 800 1483 numaramızdan bizi arayabilirsiniz.

### Bilinen Cloud Saldırıları Nelerdir ?

Siteler Arası Sahtecilik (Cross-Site Request Forgery): CSRF, kurbanı, doğası gereği zararlı olan, kullanıcı olarak bazı görevleri yerine getirme isteği göndermeye ikna etmek için tasarlanmış bir saldırıdır. Yan Kanal Saldırıları (Side Channel Attacks): Bu saldırı türü buluta özgüdür ve potansiyel olarak çok yıkıcıdır, ancak büyük ölçüde beceri ve şans gerektirir. Bu saldırı şekli, mağdurun gizliliğini dolaylı olarak bulutta paylaşılan kaynakları kullandıkları gerçeğinden yararlanarak ihlal etmeye çalışır. İmza Sarma Atakları (Signature Wrapping Attacks): Bu, başka bir saldırı türüdür, bulut ortamına özgü değildir, ancak bir web uygulamasının güvenliğini açısından tehlikeli bir yöntemdir. Temel olarak, imza sarma saldırısı, web servislerinde kullanılan bir tekniğin kullanılmasına dayanır. Diğer Ataklar: Ağ koklama kullanarak servis kaçırma XSS saldırıları kullanarak oturum kaçırma Alan Adı Sistemi (DNS) saldırıları SQL enjeksiyon saldırıları Kriptanaliz saldırıları Hizmet reddi (DoS) ve Dağıtılmış DoS saldırıları Gibi örnekler verilebilir.

### Neden Cloud Sızma Testi Yaptırmalıyım

Sistemlerinizdeki güvenlik açıklarının siber güvenlik şirketleri tarafından kontrol edilmesi, güçlü ve zayıf yanlarının raporlanarak bilginize sunulması sistem güvenliğiniz adına büyük önem arz etmektedir. Fakat şirketinizin güvenliği sistemleriniz kadar Cloud tabanlı altyapınızın güvenliğine de bağlıdır. Cloud sızma testi hizmetimiz, buluttaki varlıklarınızın gerçekten ne kadar güvenli olduğunu belirlemenizde yardımcı olacaktır.

### Güvenlik Operasyon Merkezi (SOC) Bana Ne Sağlar ?

SOC’nizin yapacağı 5 temel şey: Kötü amaçlı ağın ve sistem etkinliğinin proaktif tespiti. Şirketlerinin bir ihlali tespit etmesi için ortalama 206 gün beklemek yerine ihlalin etkisini en aza indirgemek için mümkün olduğunca çabuk haberdar olmak istersiniz. Tehdit Farkındalığı sayesinde tehdit sizi vurmadan önce savunma konfigürasyonunu yeniden yapılandırabilme Güvenlik Açığı Yönetimi sayesinde ağınızdaki yeni tehditlere karşı neyin tehlikeye girebileceğini görme Ağınızda çalışan donanım ve yazılım varlıklarının farkındalığını sayesinde; varlıklarınıza yönelik ne tür tehditlere maruz kaldığınızdan haberdar olma Log Yönetimi sayesinde, bir güvenlik olayına veya yetkisiz erişime maruz kalmanız durumunda size ve herhangi bir otoriteye adli bilişimi tamamlama yetkinliğine sahip olma Bunlar, uyumluluk izlemesi ve diğerleri gibi SOC’nizde istediğiniz ana işlevlerdir. Şirketinizin korunmasını sağlamak için hepsinin kritik fonksiyonlar olduğu tartışılmazdır.

[+] Title: AjentiCP Dir Name Based Stored XSS <= v1.2.23.13
[+] Author: Numan OZDEMIR
[+] Vendor Homepage: ajenti.org
[+] Version: Up to v1.2.23.13.
[+] Discovered by Numan OZDEMIR in InfinitumIT Labs
[+] root@numanozdemir.com - info@infinitumit.com.tr
[~] Description:
Attacker can inject JavaScript codes without Ajenti privileges by this vulnerabillity.
Normally an attacker cant intervene to Ajenti without Ajenti privileges.
But with this vulnerability, if attacker can create a folder (may be by a web app vulnerability) he can run
bad-purposed JavaScript codes on Ajenti user's browser, while the user using File Manager tool.
So this vulnerability makes high risk.
[~] How to Reproduce:
1)- Create a directory as named xss payload. Like, im![]()dir
2)- Open this directory in File Manager tool in Ajenti server admin panel.
// for secure days...
