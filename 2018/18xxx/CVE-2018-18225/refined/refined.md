CVE-2018-18225:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: The CoAP dissector in Wireshark does not correctly compute the piv length, leading to a potential crash.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Incorrect length computation in the CoAP dissector.
  - Impact of exploitation: A malformed packet or trace file can cause Wireshark to crash.
  - Attack vectors: By injecting a malformed CoAP packet onto the wire or convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a system running Wireshark, or provide a malicious packet capture file.

CVE-2018-18226:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: The Steam IHS Discovery dissector in Wireshark could consume excessive system memory due to a memory-management issue.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:  The Steam IHS Discovery dissector had inefficient memory management.
  - Impact of exploitation:  The vulnerability could lead to excessive memory consumption, potentially crashing Wireshark.
  - Attack vectors: By sending a crafted Steam IHS Discovery packet.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: Network access to the machine running Wireshark.

CVE-2018-18227:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: The MS-WSP dissector in Wireshark had a NULL return value handling issue which could lead to a crash.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The dissector did not properly handle NULL return values.
  - Impact of exploitation: A malformed packet or trace file can cause Wireshark to crash.
  - Attack vectors: By injecting a malformed MS-WSP packet onto the wire or convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a system running Wireshark, or provide a malicious packet capture file.

CVE-2018-19622:
  - Root cause of vulnerability:  The MMSE dissector in Wireshark could go into an infinite loop due to a length overflow.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:  Length overflows in the MMSE dissector code.
  - Impact of exploitation: This could lead to an infinite loop, effectively causing a denial of service in Wireshark.
  - Attack vectors: By injecting a malformed MMSE packet onto the wire or convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position:  An attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a system running Wireshark, or provide a malicious packet capture file.

CVE-2018-16058:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: The Bluetooth AVDTP dissector in Wireshark could crash due to not properly initializing a data structure.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Improper initialization of data structure in the Bluetooth AVDTP dissector.
  - Impact of exploitation: A malformed packet or trace file can cause Wireshark to crash.
  - Attack vectors:  By injecting a malformed Bluetooth AVDTP packet or convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a system running Wireshark, or provide a malicious packet capture file.

CVE-2018-16057:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: The Radiotap dissector in Wireshark could crash due to a lack of validation of iterator operations.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Improper validation of iterator operations in the Radiotap dissector
  - Impact of exploitation: A malformed packet or trace file can cause Wireshark to crash.
  - Attack vectors: By injecting a crafted Radiotap packet or convincing a user to open a malicious packet capture file.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a system running Wireshark, or provide a malicious packet capture file.
