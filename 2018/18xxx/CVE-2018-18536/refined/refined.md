{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The GLCKIo and Asusgio drivers expose functionality to read/write data from/to IO ports without sufficient access control.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Exposed IOCTL with Insufficient Access Control [CWE-782]"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Local attacker can elevate privileges by leveraging the port mapped I/O access to run code with elevated privileges. The provided PoC demonstrates a hard reset of the PC.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access to the vulnerable device drivers.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs local access to the system and the ability to interact with the vulnerable device drivers."
