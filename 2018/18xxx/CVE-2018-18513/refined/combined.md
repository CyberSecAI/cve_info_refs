## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2019-03

## Security vulnerabilities fixed in Thunderbird 60.5

Announced
January 29, 2019
Impact
critical
Products
Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Thunderbird 60.5

*In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

#### [#CVE-2018-18500: Use-after-free parsing HTML5 stream](#CVE-2018-18500)

Reporter
Yaniv Frank with SophosLabs
Impact
critical
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur while parsing an HTML5 stream in concert with custom HTML elements. This results in the stream parser object being freed while still in use, leading to a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1510114](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1510114)

#### [#CVE-2018-18505: Privilege escalation through IPC channel messages](#CVE-2018-18505)

Reporter
Jed Davis
Impact
high
##### Description

An earlier fix for an Inter-process Communication (IPC) vulnerability, CVE-2011-3079, added authentication to communication between IPC endpoints and server parents during IPC process creation. This authentication is insufficient for channels created after the IPC process is started, leading to the authentication not being correctly applied to later channels. This could allow for a sandbox escape through IPC channels due to lack of message validation in the listener process.

Reporter
Hanno Böck, Damian Poddebniak
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A crash can occur when processing a crafted S/MIME message or an XPI package containing a crafted signature. This can be used as a denial-of-service (DOS) attack because Thunderbird reopens the last seen message on restart, triggering the crash again.

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Alex Gaynor, Christoph Diehl, Steven Crane, Jason Kratzer, Gary Kwong, and Christian Holler reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 64, Firefox ESR 60.4, and Thunderbird 60.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner

[Handful of use-after-free crashes in libical](attachment.cgi?id=8756033) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8756033&action=edit)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10\_11\_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/50.0.2661.102 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
Hello,
After fuzzing libical for a bit (tested against 1.0, 1.0.1 from [http://www.citadel.org/doku.php/documentation:featured\_projects:libical](http://www.citadel.org/doku.php/documentation%3Afeatured_projects%3Alibical) and from libical git master), I have a small handful of use-after-free crashes, but are likely the same root cause. These might fall under the bug bounty, they might not. Thunderbird does use libical for parsing, however. Let me know if this is an improper place to submit this bug report.
[http://mxr.mozilla.org/comm-central/search?string=icalcomponent\_as\_ical\_string&find=%2F&findi=&filter=%5E%5B%5E%5C0%5D\*%24&hitlimit=&tree=comm-central](http://mxr.mozilla.org/comm-central/search?string=icalcomponent_as_ical_string&find=%2F&findi=&filter=%5E%5B%5E%5C0%5D*%24&hitlimit=&tree=comm-central)
With any of the above mentioned versions, you can go from the root of the project, and make a directory called 'build', then cd to this directory and run cmake to compile with ASan.
cmake -DCMAKE\_CXX\_FLAGS="-fsanitize=address -fno-omit-frame-pointer" -DCMAKE\_EXE\_LINKER\_FLAGS="-fsanitize=address" -DCMAKE\_CXX\_COMPILER="clang++" ..
After compiling, while still in the build directory, the src/test/parser binary should be usable to reproduce my results. Simply pass the file to parse as an argument to the file.
I submitted a brief issue on github for the libical project (<https://github.com/libical/libical/issues/235>), looking for a secure way to get these files to the devs, but have gotten no response back.
Actual results:
Below is one of the stack traces from ASan. As you can see, the crash is the library for libical.

Philipp: do you have contacts with the libical team, or do we just grab their source. We'll need to figure out if these could be triggered in Thunderbird/Lightning, but even if they can't we need to let the libical maintainers know about them.
If you don't have contacts let the security team know and we'll reach out through our more general OSS security contacts.Component: Untriaged → GeneralFlags: needinfo?(philipp)Product: Thunderbird → Calendar

Lightning uses an older version of libical actually, I believe it is a derivative of 0.47. We are somewhat aware that there are issues with this older version, but as we are aiming to get rid of it we haven't taken action.
I've been in contact with Allen Winter before, although it has been a while. Per github his email is allen.winter@kdab.com. I have better contact to Ken Murchison, while he does not belong to the github org around libical, he is the #2 contributor for the project.
Let me know if you want me to introduce you to Ken or Allen, or if you want me to convey something.Flags: needinfo?(philipp)

Using my crashes against libical 0.47 yields even more results actually. They are attached.

If you find different crashes with different causes, you will need to open up a bug for each. They cannot all go into the same bug as it muddies up fixing things then because some may get fixed and the others lost.

Yes, sorry about that. Since this was originally opened with use-after-free in the title, I will keep those here and open a new bug report with the other crashes.

Each use-after-free, if they are a different crash and a different cause, should be in its own bug.

I believe they are the same bug, just with different paths being used to reach it.

Hi Brandon,
Thanks for the bug report. I am unable to reproduce the crash using commit af48b97b12f8d61bbaad3cd40d3a122a602a8648.
Did you happen to make local changes to the source before fuzzing? Also can you please up date to the latest commit and attach a single test case that will reproduce the crash as well as a matching ASan log with line numbers?

I've made no source changes. I tested against 0.47, 1.0, and master from 5 days ago (<https://github.com/libical/libical/issues/235>). The commit you are testing is from 3 days ago.
However, with the latest commit, I am able to still repro the issue with the testcase I will attach soon.

Hmm still no luck on my side. I'm not saying there isn't bug, only that I can't confirm it. You may need to contact Ken or Allen as suggested by Philipp (see [comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=1275400#c2 "RESOLVED FIXED - Handful use-after-free crashes in libical (used in Thunderbird)")) if you are not already in contact with them.
I did notice that the default build is not a static build. Perhaps you are using an old version of the lib from some where else on your system? Shot in the dark here, but hey I've done it before. First clear out build directly completely then try:
cmake -DCMAKE\_CXX\_FLAGS="-fsanitize=address -fno-omit-frame-pointer" -DCMAKE\_EXE\_LINKER\_FLAGS="-fsanitize=address" -DSTATIC\_ONLY=true -DCMAKE\_CXX\_COMPILER="clang++" ..
The only addition I've made is -DSTATIC\_ONLY=true so we get a static build and we know the code we are testing is in that binary. If you can still reproduce the issue after that I'll have to leave it up to the devs to investigate.

In the linked secret github gist, the entire process of rm'ing the build, rebuilding, then running the input to produce the use-after-free has been documented against the latest git commit.
<https://gist.github.com/brandonprry/9208ebd0bd4b79a6b2e98c92c8994f0a>
The issue still persists. If you don't believe that Thunderbird is vulnerable to this, that's OK. I knew going in what I was testing wasn't exactly what shipped with Thunderbird, but I didn't know what version it used (until just recently when 0.47 was mentioned). It's difficult to test against exactly what Thunderbird has, but if you have any suggestions, I will try them.

Ha got it! Compiler versions :) Thanks for the gist looking at the diff helped.
FWIW: I am was using clang 3.7.1 now I'm using clang 3.8.0.

Please also note that the version of libical that Lightning uses has some patches on top of 0.47, so there may be slight differences to the release version and maybe the one or other case less than in the github release.

I was able to copy the libical source code from the Lightning source tree into my libical 0.47 source tree, replacing any files that were changed with the Lightning copy. I was still able to reproduce the use after free.

Putting Ken and Allen on CC for the record. tl;dr; these issues also apply to the latest libical on github. If you also have time to take a look I would certainly appreciate, of course I'd take care of the backport myself.

If there is any other information required to determine whether this affects Lightning/Thunderbird, please ask. In the original bug report, I provided the source code I believed to be vulnerable in Thunderbird.

In an effort to provide more information, I have spent the day attempting to build Thunderbird + calendar with ASan to prove the code path I linked is viable, but I am unable to build thunderbird + calendar with ASan.
Building without ASan builds as expected but I don't get clear crashes. The line below will build Thunderbird + calendar successfully.
export CC=clang CXX=clang++ CFLAGS="" CXXFLAGS="" LDFLAGS=""; make -f client.mk
This one fails to build, and I am not sure why at this point.
export CC=clang CXX=clang++ CFLAGS="-fsanitize=address" CXXFLAGS="" LDFLAGS="-fsanitize=address"; make -f client.mk

So, after having dug in to this a bit more, it looks like an attacker may not be able to directly control the ical data being used through the vector I have pointed out, but I am not 100%.
However, while going through the source code, I noticed the ical function used to parse untrusted ical data is actually icalparser\_parse\_string(), which I have actually fuzzed and have a few bugs in as well. I will open these separately this evening after triaging.

Since there is no traction on any of these bugs related to libical, I've gone ahead and just made my research into libical public. I won't be updating these bug reports anymore.
Feel free to do whatever you would like with the bug reports I have opened.

Extension "{e2fda1a4-762b-4020-b5ad-a41df1933103}" is Lightning. So upstream Thunderbird seems to be affected by this CVE.

all those bugs have been squashed since libical3.0.0

Attached patch

[PortUseAfterFreeFixesForLibical-V1.diff](attachment.cgi?id=9009439&action=diff) (obsolete)

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1275400&attachment=9009439)

This patch backports four upstream commits I identified based on the previous comments to our version of libical:
\* Issue 253 / Commit 6b9438d746cec6e4e632d78c5244f4be6314d1c9
\* Issue 251 / Commit 38757abb495ea6cb40faa5418052278bf75040f7
\* Issue 251 / Commit 04d84749e53db08c71ed0ce8b6ba5c11082743cd
\* Issue 251 / Commit 830d9530817516377c2bc3b532798ce2c6b4765a
This is compiling and working locally for me, but I neither haven't done a try push so far nor have I investigated whether this would prevent the reported crashes.
Allen, can you confirm that I catched all upstream commits associated to [CVE-2016-5824](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-5824) since not all of them are clearly referenced in the issues?Assignee: nobody → makemydayStatus: UNCONFIRMED → ASSIGNEDEver confirmed: trueFlags: needinfo?(winter)

Thanks for looking through these. Codewise this looks ok. Can you do a try run? I hope these don't depend on other upstream changes.

I currently have problems to push, so if anybody else can do a try push before I fixed my issue, that would be appreciated.

Attached patch

[PortUseAfterFreeFixesForLibical-V2.diff](attachment.cgi?id=9012583&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9012583&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1275400&attachment=9012583)

I have removed the change to parser\_get\_next\_char in icalparser.c from the previous version of the patch since that led to test failures due to a different behaviour including to fail to parse an attendee at all if its CN has double dquotes (like CN=""some name"") instead of just having an attendee without a valid CN in this case. Maybe some more backports would have been needed to make it work as before or it's an upstream issue.
But since that change (upstream commit 04d84749e53db08c71ed0ce8b6ba5c11082743cd) is technically not needed beacause our code is different from upstream for that function and the upstream fix corrects something we don't have, we can omit this backport entirely here.
My try push for this patch doesn't have any releated failures: <https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try-comm-central&selectedJob=201941490&revision=d753c49aa747091057455a35ee1224d24bd73d0a>

PortUseAfterFreeFixesForLibical-V2.diff
Since backing on c-c probably won't bring any findings (since ical.js is the default) and I have been running the patched version for some time now without an issue, we should consider an early uplift.

This line is the only change here, all the rest of the changes in this hunk are white-space changes that change tabs to spaces. Is that intentional? Personally, I'd only change that one line given that the entire library is riddled with white-space issues.

Yes, the whitespace changes are intended. Please land the patch as is.Flags: needinfo?(makemyday)
