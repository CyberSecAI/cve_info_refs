Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-18513:

**CVE Description:**

The provided content gives a description of CVE-2018-18513 as: "A crash can occur when processing a crafted S/MIME message or an XPI package containing a crafted signature. This can be used as a denial-of-service (DOS) attack because Thunderbird reopens the last seen message on restart, triggering the crash again."

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Thunderbird handles crafted S/MIME messages or XPI packages that contain manipulated signatures. The root cause is not explicitly stated, but the crash occurs during the processing of these crafted inputs, suggesting a parsing or validation error within the cryptographic or signature handling logic of Thunderbird or potentially its underlying libraries like NSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Handling:** The primary weakness is Thunderbird's failure to properly handle and validate specially crafted S/MIME messages and XPI package signatures, leading to a crash.
- **Potential Cryptographic Issue:** The crafting of signatures suggests a potential issue in cryptographic handling of signatures.
- **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** A crafted message that causes a crash that can be triggered on restart makes Thunderbird vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** An attacker can repeatedly crash Thunderbird by sending a specially crafted S/MIME message, effectively preventing a user from using the application. This is further exacerbated by the fact that Thunderbird reopens the last seen message upon restart, causing a crash loop.
- **Potential for further exploitation (speculative):** While not explicitly stated in the content, a crash of this nature may, in some cases, be exploitable for arbitrary code execution but this is not described in the advisory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email:** Sending a crafted S/MIME message via email.
- **XPI Package:** Delivering a malicious XPI package containing the crafted signature as an addon.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Send Emails:** The attacker must be capable of sending emails to the victim's email address or delivering a crafted XPI package to the user.
- **Knowledge of Exploitable Crafting:** The attacker needs knowledge to create or obtain a crafted S/MIME message or XPI package with the triggering vulnerability. This may require reverse engineering or exploiting details of the affected software.

**Additional Notes**
- The fix involved upgrading NSS, indicating that the vulnerability likely lies within the underlying cryptographic libraries used by Thunderbird, specifically related to signature verification.
- The bug report ([Bug 1533300](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1533300)) associated with this CVE mentions that it was fixed by upgrading NSS, highlighting that the root cause was not in Thunderbird code itself but in the NSS library.
- The impact is moderate, since the issue is a denial of service, and not arbitrary code execution.
