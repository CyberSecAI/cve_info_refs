**Vulnerability:** Self Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Affected Product:** Zoho ManageEngine OpManager

**Affected Version:** 12.3

**Root Cause:** The application allows for the injection of client-side scripts by a user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Self-XSS: The vulnerability requires the user to be the one injecting the malicious script, usually through the browser itself.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- This can lead to the exposure of sensitive information if the attacker manages to steal session tokens via crafted javascript.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A user of the application would need to be tricked or convinced to enter malicious JavaScript code into a field or section that executes javascript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to social engineer or trick the victim into pasting malicious code into the browser when logged into ManageEngine OpManager.
- No network access or server access is needed.

**Remediation:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in the latest version of OPManager, specifically build number 123219. Users are advised to update to the latest version.
