Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Tenda router's web server (httpd). Specifically, the vulnerability occurs during the processing of the `deviceMac` parameter within a POST request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The `deviceMac` parameter value is directly passed to `sprintf` which writes to a stack-based local variable without proper bounds checking. This can overwrite the return address of the function.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The web server doesn't sanitize or validate the length of the `deviceMac` parameter before using it in `sprintf`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) results in a denial-of-service. The buffer overflow overwrites the return address on the stack causing the device to crash.
- **Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE):** While the provided PoC causes a DoS, the vulnerability itself (stack-based buffer overflow) could potentially be exploited to achieve Remote Code Execution by carefully crafting the input to overwrite the return address with an attacker's address, and injecting malicious code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP POST request targeting the router's web server (httpd), sending a long value for the `deviceMac` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the router's web interface.
- **Knowledge of Target URL:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable URL with the overflowing `deviceMac` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**

- The affected Tenda router models include AC9, AC7, AC10, AC15, and AC18, and possibly others using the same firmware with versions V15.03.05.19(6318)_CN(AC9), V15.03.06.44_CN(AC7), V15.03.06.23_CN(AC10), V15.03.05.19_CN(AC15), V15.03.05.19(6318)_CN(AC18) and earlier.
- The content provides more detail than a standard CVE description, including the specific vulnerable parameter (`deviceMac`), the vulnerable function (`sprintf`), the location of the overflow (stack), and a PoC.
