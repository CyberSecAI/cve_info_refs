  "CVE-2018-18247": {
    "description": "Icinga Web 2 before 2.6.2 has XSS via the /icingaweb2/navigation/add icon parameter.",
    "root_cause": "The application fails to sanitize the input provided through the 'icon' parameter in the /icingaweb2/navigation/add endpoint.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker sends a crafted request to the vulnerable endpoint, including malicious JavaScript in the 'icon' parameter."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires a low privileged user account with access to the Icinga Web 2 interface to inject the malicious payload. User interaction is required to trigger the XSS. The attacker also needs to know the path to the vulnerable endpoint."

  "CVE-2018-18246": {
    "description": "Icinga Web 2 before 2.6.2 has CSRF via /icingaweb2/config/moduledisable?name=monitoring to disable the monitoring module, or via /icingaweb2/config/moduleenable?name=setup to enable the setup module.",
    "root_cause": "The application does not properly validate the origin of requests to module management endpoints, leading to CSRF.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"

    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker crafts a malicious link or web page that, when visited by an authenticated user, sends requests to the vulnerable endpoints (/icingaweb2/config/moduledisable or /icingaweb2/config/moduleenable)."
    ],

    "CVE-2018-18250": {
    "description": "Icinga Web 2 before 2.6.2 allows parameters that break navigation dashlets, as demonstrated by a single '$' character as the Name of a Navigation item.",
    "root_cause": "The application does not validate parameters used in navigation dashlets, allowing the insertion of characters that break their functionality.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation"

    "impact": "An attacker can disrupt the navigation dashlets, making the Icinga Web 2 interface unusable or more difficult to navigate.",
    "attack_vectors": [
       "An attacker crafts a malicious navigation item with a '$' character (or other breaking character) as its Name. This could be done via the web interface or via crafted API requests."

    "description": "Icinga Web 2 before 2.6.2 allows injection of PHP ini-file directives via vectors involving environment variables as the channel to send information to the attacker, such as a name=${PATH}\_${APACHE\_RUN\_DIR}\_${APACHE\_RUN\_USER} parameter to /icingaweb2/navigation/add or /icingaweb2/dashboard/new-dashlet.",

     ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary PHP ini-file directives, potentially allowing them to gain access to sensitive information (by manipulating log paths or error settings), disrupt the application or other malicious activity. The attacker can also use it to enumerate server environment variables.",
    "attack_vectors": [
       "The attacker crafts a malicious parameter, using environment variables as the channel to send information through the `name` parameter in `/icingaweb2/navigation/add` or `/icingaweb2/dashboard/new-dashlet` endpoints."
