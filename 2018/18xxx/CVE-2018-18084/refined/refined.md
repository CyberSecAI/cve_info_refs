Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described, which do relate to CVE-2018-18084, as the content discusses vulnerabilities in DuomiCMS v3.0, which is the product mentioned in the CVE.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The provided document details three vulnerabilities within DuomiCms v3.0:

1.  **XXE vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the use of the `simplexml_load_file` and `simplexml_load_string` functions to process XML data from a file that can be modified by the attacker, which are `data/admin/playerKinds.xml`. However, this vulnerability was mitigated due to HTML entity encoding of special characters.
2.  **Front-end Code Execution:** The root cause lies in the parsing of template tags. The system concatenates parsed tags and executes them via the `eval` function, allowing for arbitrary PHP code execution. Specifically the vulnerability is located in `duomiphp/core.class.php` within the `parseIf` and `parseSubIf` functions, which are called when processing template tags.
3.  **SQL Injection:** The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of the `$uid` variable, which is directly concatenated into SQL queries within the `duomiphp/ajax.php` file, specifically in the `addfav` method. The vulnerability also involves bypassing SQL detection rules in `duomiphp/sql.class.php`, where string manipulation is done to pass malicious SQL code through the filter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **XXE (Mitigated):** The potential for XML External Entity injection was present, but mitigated due to the HTML encoding.
2.  **Unsafe use of `eval`:** The `eval` function is used to execute code derived from user inputs within template parsing.
3.  **SQL Injection:** Direct concatenation of user-controlled input into SQL queries without proper sanitization. Insufficient SQL injection protection mechanisms can be bypassed due to how the filtering is applied.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **XXE (Mitigated):** An attacker could potentially read local files or perform other attacks, which was prevented due to HTML encoding.
2.  **Front-end Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data exfiltration, or denial of service.
3.  **SQL Injection:** An attacker can read sensitive data from the database, potentially including administrator credentials, or modify data.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **XXE (Mitigated):** Sending crafted data to `admin/admin_player.php` (POST `playername`, `info`, `order`, `trail`)
2.  **Front-end Code Execution:** By injecting malicious template tags in parameters such as the `searchword` parameter in `search.php`.
3.  **SQL Injection:** By crafting malicious payloads in the `uid` parameter in `duomiphp/ajax.php` when using the `addfav` action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **XXE (Mitigated):** Requires access to the admin panel to modify the XML file.
2.  **Front-end Code Execution:** Requires the ability to submit requests to the front-end pages with malicious template tags.
3.  **SQL Injection:** Requires the ability to send requests to the `ajax.php` endpoint with a crafted `uid` parameter. No administrative access is required.
