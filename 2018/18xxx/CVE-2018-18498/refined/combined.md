| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=1488180#c0)• 6 years ago |
|  | |

Extensions are only allowed to load some URLs (http(s), ftp:, moz-extension:, and about:blank).
However, these restrictions can be bypassed by using pipes in the URL passed to the browser.windows.create API.
STR
1. Install any add-on (no extension permissions required).
2. Visit about:debugging and click on the Debug button at the add-on.
3. Run the following snippet:
browser.windows.create({
url: "about:blank?|file:///tmp/|about:config"
});
Expected:
- An "about:blank" URL should be opened (maybe with some junk in its query string).
Actual:
- Three tabs are opened: "about:blank", "file:///tmp" and "about:config". The last two URLs are restricted URLs.
The crazy behavior of | will hopefully be addressed by [bug 1485961](/show_bug.cgi?id=1485961 "NEW - Make window.arguments handling in browser windows less quixotic and labyrinthine") (not adding see also because that bug is public).
I will covertly plug this hole (together with [bug 1486738](/show_bug.cgi?id=1486738 "RESOLVED FIXED - Tabs created through browser.windows.create are not associated with the extension's principal")) via (public) [bug 1393570](/show_bug.cgi?id=1393570 "VERIFIED FIXED - Consider windows.create cookieStoreId property").

I have submitted the patch for [bug 1393570](/show_bug.cgi?id=1393570 "VERIFIED FIXED - Consider windows.create cookieStoreId property"): <https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D4929>
That patch fixes this bug, by adding a number of parameters so that the code goes through this branch:
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/c3fef66a5b211ea8038c1c132706d02db408093a/browser/base/content/browser.js#1658>
instead of this branch (which ends up splitting the URL on pipes, causing this bug):
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/c3fef66a5b211ea8038c1c132706d02db408093a/browser/base/content/browser.js#1687-1688>

Verified as fixed using Firefox 64(buildid 20181105164654) on Winsows 10x64 and macOS 10.13.6.
I also confirmed that issue was reproducible on earlier FF versions.

The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Diego Calleja, Andrew McCreight, Jon Coppeard, Jed Davis, Natalia Csoregi, Nicolas B. Pierron, and Tyson Smith reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 63 and Firefox ESR 60.3. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context,

an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service,

bypass same-origin restrictions, or execute arbitrary code.

Reporter

Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Diego Calleja, Andrew McCreight, Jon Coppeard, Jed Davis, Natalia Csoregi, Nicolas B. Pierron, and Tyson Smith reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 63 and Firefox ESR 60.3. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Diego Calleja, Andrew McCreight, Jon Coppeard, Jed Davis, Natalia Csoregi, Nicolas B. Pierron, and Tyson Smith reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 63 and Firefox ESR 60.3. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.11; rv:61.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/61.0
Steps to reproduce:
This is the same issue as [bug#1495011](/show_bug.cgi?id=1495011 "RESOLVED FIXED - Unsafe use of CheckedInt (possible buffer overflow) in ScriptLoader::ConvertToUTF16").
nsresult
nsContentUtils::CalculateBufferSizeForImage(const uint32\_t& aStride,
const IntSize& aImageSize,
const SurfaceFormat& aFormat,
size\_t\* aMaxBufferSize,
size\_t\* aUsedBufferSize)
{
CheckedInt32 requiredBytes =
CheckedInt32(aStride) \* CheckedInt32(aImageSize.height);
if (!requiredBytes.isValid()) {
return NS\_ERROR\_FAILURE;
}
\*aMaxBufferSize = requiredBytes.value();
\*aUsedBufferSize = \*aMaxBufferSize - aStride + (aImageSize.width \* BytesPerPixel(aFormat));
return NS\_OK;
}
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/base/nsContentUtils.cpp#7863>
requiredBytes is checked for an overflow, however a couple of lines later its raw unchecked value is used in arithmetic calculations again. Thus aUsedBufferSize can potentially overflow on x86 systems.

# USN-3844-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

11 December 2018

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.10](/security/notices?release=cosmic)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service, bypass same-origin

restritions, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-12405](/security/CVE-2018-12405), [CVE-2018-12406](/security/CVE-2018-12406),

[CVE-2018-12407](/security/CVE-2018-12407), [CVE-2018-17466](/security/CVE-2018-17466), [CVE-2018-18492](/security/CVE-2018-18492), [CVE-2018-18493](/security/CVE-2018-18493),

[CVE-2018-18494](/security/CVE-2018-18494), [CVE-2018-18498](/security/CVE-2018-18498))

Multiple security issues were discovered in WebExtensions. If a user were

tricked in to installing a specially crafted extension, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to open privileged pages, or bypass other

security restrictions. ([CVE-2018-18495](/security/CVE-2018-18495), [CVE-2018-18497](/security/CVE-2018-18497))

Taking the bug from Dragana after a F2F discussion.
The check whether to add an entry (a channel) to a perf storage is made at [1]. I would expect we get blocked there, but we don't. The story is way different.
Taking the redirffeg2.html PoC and serving it locally to have a control over it, I ran the following tests and monitored load info and loading doc of each channel that tried to add itself at [1].
Test #1, the PoC for this bug, location="":
"<http://test.local/bugs/1487964/ffredirtest.html>"
- innerWindow=0x00000228c56be820,
- perf=0x00000228c62a6000,
- mLoadInfo->TP=0x00000228bab6138c "<http://test.local/bugs/1487964/redirffeg2.html>"
- loadingDoc->NP=0x00000228bab6138c "<http://test.local/bugs/1487964/redirffeg2.html>"
"<http://test.local/bugs/1487964/ffloctest.html>"
- innerWindow=0x00000228bd173020,
- perf=0x00000228c6281000,
- mLoadInfo->TP=0x00000228c62e260c "<http://test.local/bugs/1487964/ffredirtest.html>",
- loadingDoc->NP=0x00000228c62e260c "<http://test.local/bugs/1487964/ffredirtest.html>"
"<https://www.bing.com/search?q=test>"
- innerWindow=0x00000228bd173020,
- perf=0x00000228c6281000,
- mLoadInfo->TP=0x00000228c62e808c "<http://test.local/bugs/1487964/ffloctest.html>",
- loadingDoc->NP=0x00000228c62e260c "<http://test.local/bugs/1487964/ffredirtest.html>"
Note that the last entry's innerWindow and perf (=mozilla::dom::Performance) are the same object as for the ffloctest.html load (the one with <script>location="...").
Hence according the (for me kinda disputable) check at [1] this is not cross origin at all.
Test #2, meta refresh:
just a single entry in the list, but 3 are trying (and passing the check at [1]!) to be added. The listing looks exactly the same as for the above test. But the difference in the result (=no-leak) is that we are adding the entries using the originalURI of the channel - which in the case of a meta refresh is "<http://test.local/bugs/1487964/ffloctest.html>" for ffloctest.html and also for www.bing.com.
Test #3, 302 redirect:
"<http://test.local/bugs/1487964/ffredirtest.html>"
- innerWindow=0x00000228c56bb820,
- perf=0x00000228c624a000,
- mLoadInfo->TP=0x00000228bab6138c "<http://test.local/bugs/1487964/redirffeg2.html>",
- loadingDoc->NP=0x00000228bab6138c "<http://test.local/bugs/1487964/redirffeg2.html>"
"<https://www.bing.com/search?q=test>"
- innerWindow=0x00000228c39ca820,
- perf=0x00000228c5660000,
- mLoadInfo->TP=0x00000228c633e10c "<http://test.local/bugs/1487964/ffredirtest.html>",
- loadingDoc->NP=0x00000228c633e10c "<http://test.local/bugs/1487964/ffredirtest.html>"
Only two entries are trying to add themselves, because the ffloctest.html channel doesn't get a chance to be added (OnStopRequest is never called for a redirected HttpChannelChild, this may be different with e10s off!) And, as we are adding using the originalURL, it will show up as "<http://test.local/bugs/1487964/ffloctest.html>" in the performance entries listing, but is actually for the "bing.com" load.
[Bug 1185256](/show_bug.cgi?id=1185256 "RESOLVED FIXED - performance.getEntries() shows x-domain URLs after a redirect when loading from cache") fixed redirects for back/forward nav and session restore by correct propagation of the originalURL between the channels through docshell.
[Bug 1468523](/show_bug.cgi?id=1468523 "VERIFIED FIXED - Stealing of URL cross-domain using performance.getEntries() once again, treat meta refresh channel as a redirect by setting result principal URL") fixed regression from combination of that bug and [bug 1319111](/show_bug.cgi?id=1319111 "RESOLVED FIXED - Expose result principal URL (\"final channel URL\") on LoadInfo, convert current consumers of LOAD_REPLACE") by correctly setting the result principal URI on the meta refresh target channel.
I don't think we want to treat location=".." assignment as a redirect. We want to treat it as a navigation - right? We do treat meta refresh as a redirect, though.
To sum - I'm not sure what exactly to do here. I am also not sure what resources should be visible in the entries list and which not. If a page loads a cross-origin script, should it be visible to the page? (assuming yes) If that page is iframe-ed, should parent see its cross origin resources? Should parent see any resource of the iframe-ed page? (no idea)
Based on answers, I think the check at [1] should be changed or enhanced.

I hope I got the Gecko terminology correct here: inner windows (WindowProxy in the HTML Standard) are best not compared as they're shared across multiple outer windows (the Window object; where you want to make security checks on or on its associated document).
However, from <https://w3c.github.io/performance-timeline/#getentries-method-0> and also <https://w3c.github.io/navigation-timing/> it's not clear to me why these PerformanceEntry objects would ever be created for a different global. I'm guessing that's happening here because the <embed> initial load is done in the load group (fetch group in the standard, but basically not defined) of the parent and only once a docshell (browsing context) is created, does it get moved. So presumably something is messed up there, coupled with the fact that none of this is defined properly and performance timing isn't even grounded in terms of Fetch, despite us complaining about that for years...Flags: needinfo?(annevk)

> I hope I got the Gecko terminology correct here
You have it backwards. Inner windows are Window; outer windows are WindowProxy.
Past that, my take is that in fact figuring out what should be happening with resource timing is more or less impossible and we should disable the API altogether until the working group addresses that. In particular, the lack of a processing model makes it hard to answer basic questions like "when a load is being done in an <embed>, what global's resource timing list should be used in which cases and why"?
To answer the specific questions from [comment 5](/show_bug.cgi?id=1487964#c5 "VERIFIED FIXED - Cross-Origin URL Steal is possible using performance.getEntries()"):
> I don't think we want to treat location=".." assignment as a redirect.
Correct. When the location="..." set happens in the <embed>, the triggering principal should be whatever started the load. That part is correct in the information in [comment 5](/show_bug.cgi?id=1487964#c5 "VERIFIED FIXED - Cross-Origin URL Steal is possible using performance.getEntries()"). A location set is \_not\_ a redirect, so the originalURI should not stay the same across it. In any case, I suspect that replacing that location set by <a href> probably has the same behavior.
> To sum - I'm not sure what exactly to do here. I am also not sure what resources
> should be visible in the entries list and which not.
Yep. Neither is anyone else, which is why i think we should disable the API.
What happens if the <embed> is replaced by <iframe>? Does the behavior stay the same? That is, is this a general "loads of a new document in a child browsing context are treated as subresources of the parent page" issue, or is there something <embed>-specific there? I'm pretty sure this came up before, but I don't recall what the decision was about what the right behavior here is (again, the spec doesn't really say) or whether that decision got implemented.
> If a page loads a cross-origin script, should it be visible to the page?
The URL the page started loading should be. If there are redirects they should not show up.
> Should parent see any resource of the iframe-ed page?
For subresources, no. For navigations in the iframe, unclear.Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky) → needinfo?(past)

My understanding, and please correct me if I'm wrong, is that we don't know how to fix this bug because we don't know how to do so while remaining spec-compliant. I can drive this discussion in the working group, but can someone more familiar with these details than me file a spec issue?
<https://github.com/w3c/navigation-timing/issues/new>
Ideally we wouldn't provide any unnecessary details that could lead to an exploit before we get a chance to fix this.
Which part of navigation-timing are we considering disabling?Flags: needinfo?(past)

|  | |

The summary of the situation as I see it is:
1) We can't tell whether we're spec-compliant now or not, nor whether we would be after various fixes to this bug. This is due to the spec not having a well-defined processing model, and not having useful tests, as far as I can see.
2) We have had a significant number of security bugs in our implementation of this spec, due to the lack of clear definition of the processing model. As a result, instead of a single security analysis being done once, in the spec, every implementation has to do their own, and we haven't been able to devote sufficient resources to that.
3) The spec has informative text that is presumably intended to clarify things but seems to directly contradict the normative spec text.
The relevant spec here is resource-timing. I think we should disable all of it.

Just for the note, None of other browsers are going to disable resource timing API all together at the time.

I'm aware of that. I just don't think we should keep shipping this given the longstanding lack of a spec and unwillingness on the part of the working group to fix that. If this API were coming up with an intent to ship right now, I would object to shipping it.

I see. Also, worth to note that Google and Apple fixed this issue by disabling performance.getEntriesByType("resource")[1], so it's always undefined when we use performance.getEntriesByType("resource")[1] on Google Chrome and Apple Safari. So this should be a correct fix for this issue as we can not trigger redirection / navigation tricks using getEntriesByType("resource")[1] anymore. It appears that Mozilla Firefox for Windows and Android doesn't have history back-forward navigation reveal problem too so this should resolve this problem.Flags: needinfo?(honzab.moz)Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

Btw, from the [comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=1487964#c9 "VERIFIED FIXED - Cross-Origin URL Steal is possible using performance.getEntries()") - "or is there something <embed>-specific there?", this is not embed specific, it's same behavior on Iframe and Object on Mozilla Firefox. In certain browsers yes, there is something embed specific. For example, we can reveal latest Cross-Origin URL continuously using history.back(); on Internet Explorer with embed because after back-forward navigation embed tag on Internet Explorer will save the latest updated page inside embed tag even after back-forward navigation. This doesn't happen when you use Iframe and Object, page inside a frame is resetted to Original URL. So that's browser specific behavior, but this does not include Mozilla Firefox, in fact it doesn't even allow to use back-forward navigation on Mozilla Firefox for Windows and Android.

Anyways, this only affects Mozilla Firefox. Disabling performance.getEntriesByType("resource")[1] like what Google and Apple did will resolve this problem.

It appears that I can not attach screenshot on this comment, but I believe it's unnecessary as anyone can test this immediately on Google Chrome or Apple Safari.

Ah, I meant Google and Apple blocked from reading .name of the resource[1] so it always return undefined when we use .name after resource[1].

Which allows us to use performance.getEntriesByType("resource")[1] but being not able to read url anymore. Thus, redirection / navigation tricks can't be triggered anymore.

The screenshot I was sent just shows that performance.getEntriesByType("resource")[1] doesn't exist in Chrome. The question is whether performance.getEntriesByType("resource")[0] exists and if so what its .name is.
In general, the really interesting thing is to stop poking at specific indices or types and just look at
Array.prototype.slice.call(performance.getEntries()).map((e) => e.name)
which will give you all the URLs you can get out via the performance timing APIs. In this case, at least in Chrome, you can see that the history navigation is not showing up in the list at all.Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

I guess you could do it even more simply in browsers that support webidl iterator bits (which might be all of them now):
performance.getEntries().map(e => e.name)

yes, performance.getEntriesByType("resource")[0] exists in Chrome (and all other browsers that supports resource timing API) and its name returns the URL before the redirection, so Cross-Origin URL reveal issue not possible at least with these tricks. Although, Chrome allowed history navigation as I mentioned before, so one could continuously reveal the Cross-Origin URL. This was fixed on Chrome 70 update yesterday.

Btw, revealing Cross-Origin history navigation also works on Firefox but only on Firefox for iOS.

It appears that their behaviors are not same for some test cases.
Anyways, that would be the correct fix for this issue.

Hey Valentin, I think there is a semantic bug in the current implementation, in particular here [1]:
> if (!mLoadInfo->TriggeringPrincipal()->Equals(loadingDocument->NodePrincipal())) {
> return nullptr;
> }
That will only add same-origin loads to the docoument's performance entries, but for iframe loads you are comparing the triggeringPrincipal with the NodePrincipal of the iframe document not the parent document.
I guess in the iframe case we want to compare the triggeringPrincipal with the loadingDocument->GetParentDocument()->NodePrincipal.
What do you think?

Valentin, I see you are setting a bit in the loadinfo, but you don't serialize that bit in BackgroundUtils (somewhere around here [1]). To avoid additional problems, that's probably worth doing - thanks!

Thanks for pointing that out. I fixed it in the latest revision, if you care to take a look.
Is there a way of making the serialization future-proof? Maybe a static\_assert regarding the size of LoadInfo, so that it fails if any new members are added?Flags: needinfo?(valentin.gosu)

Thanks for incorporating that change. I agree, current practice of manually adding serialization code to BackgroundUtils.cpp and hoping that people don't forget to do that is not very bullet proof. FWIW, I filed [Bug 1506108](/show_bug.cgi?id=1506108 "NEW - Investigate if we can be smarter when serializing a Loadinfo") to investigate if we can add some guards to make it harder to shoot ourselves in the foot.

Taking [Comment #42](/show_bug.cgi?id=1487964#c42 "VERIFIED FIXED - Cross-Origin URL Steal is possible using performance.getEntries()") into consideration I have talked to Valentin Gosu and got the list of bugs that need verifying in order for this bug to be considered verified fixed. The list is:
- [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1468523](/show_bug.cgi?id=1468523 "VERIFIED FIXED - Stealing of URL cross-domain using performance.getEntries() once again, treat meta refresh channel as a redirect by setting result principal URL")
- [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1254688](/show_bug.cgi?id=1254688 "RESOLVED FIXED - Resource Timing API is storing resources sent by the previous page.")
- [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1408990](/show_bug.cgi?id=1408990 "VERIFIED FIXED - Resource Timing API leaks URL after subframe navigation")
None of these were affected by the fix to this bug, so I consider this issue to be VERIFIED FIXED for firefox 64 and 65.
