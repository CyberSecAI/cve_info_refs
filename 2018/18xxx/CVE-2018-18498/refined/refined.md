Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-18498:

**1. Verification of Relevance**
   - The content from Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSA-2019:0160, RHSA-2019:0159, RHSA-2018:3833, and RHSA-2018:3831), Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-3868-1 and USN-3844-1) and the Mozilla Security Advisory clearly identify CVE-2018-18498 as an "Integer overflow when calculating buffer sizes for images."
   - The Bugzilla entry ([Bug 1658402](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1658402)) also references CVE-2018-18498 and its description matches "Mozilla: Integer overflow when calculating buffer sizes for images"
   - Bugzilla entry [Bug 1500011](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1500011) and the Mozilla Security Advisory also directly mentions the vulnerability.
   - Therefore, the provided content is directly related to CVE-2018-18498

**2. Vulnerability Details**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by an integer overflow during buffer size calculations for images. The issue arises because a raw, unchecked value is used in buffer size calculation, instead of the safe CheckedInt32 value. 
*   **Weakness:** The primary weakness is an integer overflow vulnerability during the calculation of buffer sizes within the image processing functionality of the affected software.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Out-of-bounds Write:** The integer overflow can lead to an out-of-bounds write, potentially causing a crash or enabling arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Memory Corruption:** In general, integer overflows can lead to memory corruption issues due to the improper calculation of memory locations.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Exploitation of the integer overflow might allow an attacker to cause a denial-of-service.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is triggered by loading and processing specially crafted images.
    *   This can occur when a user interacts with web pages or via email clients (Thunderbird) that render images.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to control the image data that is processed by the vulnerable code. 
    *   This typically means the attacker would need to be able to influence the loading of images via a malicious website, email or other means where images can be loaded.
    *   No special privileges are necessary to trigger the vulnerability.

**3. Additional Details (Beyond CVE description):**

*   The specific vulnerable code is in `nsContentUtils::CalculateBufferSizeForImage` where it uses raw values of previously validated `CheckedInt32`. 
*   The fix involves using CheckedInt32 more pervasively in the buffer size calculations.
*   The issue is reproducible on x86 systems.
*   The fix addresses the issue by adding a number of parameters so that the code goes through a different branch that does not split the URL on pipes, which was a separate vulnerability.
*  It is noted that this can be exploited in a browser context or contexts where similar rendering functionality exists, but scripting needs to be enabled for the attack. Thunderbird disables scripting when reading emails, thus this attack vector is less of a concern within Thunderbird.

**4. Resolution**
   - The vulnerability is fixed in Firefox 64 and Firefox ESR 60.4 and Thunderbird 60.4
   - Red Hat and Ubuntu issued security advisories and fixed the vulnerability by updating the respective packages. 
   - The fix is also available in the mozilla65 milestone.

**In summary, CVE-2018-18498 is caused by an integer overflow vulnerability in image processing code. This vulnerability can allow a remote attacker to cause memory corruption or denial of service by providing maliciously crafted images. The provided content clearly explains the root cause, the weakness, the impact of exploitation, the attack vector, and the required attacker capabilities. Patches have been released for various distributions and browsers to resolve this issue.**
