Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the XSS vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `fname` parameter when adding or editing food items in the Waimai Super Cms admin panel. The application does not encode or filter potentially malicious script tags within the `fname` parameter before rendering the data back to the user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The application takes user-supplied input and displays it on the page without proper sanitization, which allows the execution of arbitrary Javascript code in the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Javascript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the `fname` parameter. This script can be executed in the context of a user's browser who views the vulnerable content.
- **Session Hijacking:** The attacker may steal session cookies or perform actions on behalf of the victim user.
- **Phishing:** The attacker could redirect the user to a malicious page or alter the appearance of the page to steal user credentials.
- **Defacement:** The attacker could alter the content of the vulnerable pages.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is initiated through an HTTP POST request sent to the server at two specific endpoints:
  - `/admin.php?m=Food&a=addsave` for adding a food item.
  - `/admin.php?m=Food&a=editsave` for editing an existing item.
- **`fname` Parameter:** The malicious payload is injected through the `fname` parameter in the POST request.
- **Multipart Form Data:** The `fname` parameter is within a multipart form data request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of how to send POST requests, including multipart form data.
- **Admin Panel access (likely):** It's likely the attacker needs to be logged into the admin panel of the Waimai Super Cms to access the vulnerable functionality.

**Technical Details:**

The provided exploit examples show the structure of the malicious POST requests including:

*   **Target URLs:**  `/admin.php?m=Food&a=addsave` and `/admin.php?m=Food&a=editsave`
*   **Payload Location:** The `<script>alert(20);</script>` (or similar) payload is injected into the `fname` form field.
*   **Multipart Form Data Structure:** The examples illustrate how to structure the multipart/form-data to inject the payload along with other required form parameters.

**Summary**
The content details a clear case of reflected XSS vulnerability where user input is not sanitized and rendered back to the user, allowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript code. The vulnerability is located in the food management functionality of Waimai Super Cms admin panel.
