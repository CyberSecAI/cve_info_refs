    - The malicious payload is embedded in the output of a Nagios check plugin.
    - An authenticated user must create an alert summary report that contains the malicious output for the XSS to be triggered.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the output of Nagios check plugins.
    - The attacker needs to trick a user to generate a report containing the malicious content.
