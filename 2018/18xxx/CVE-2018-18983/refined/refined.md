- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The program reads the contents of a file (already in memory) into another heap-based buffer without proper size checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could cause the program to crash or allow remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability can be exploited by providing a crafted input file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted file to the application. The attack is remotely exploitable and requires low skill to execute. The user needs to be tricked into opening the malicious file, indicated by the User Interaction requirement.
