- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper sanitization of user input leads to the possibility of executing remote code on the server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Injection (CWE-74). Specifically, improper neutralization of special elements in output used by a downstream component.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution, potentially leading to data exfiltration or system crashes.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by user-supplied input that is not properly sanitized before being processed by the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to supply the malicious user input. User interaction is required (UI:R) for successful exploitation. Network access (AV:N) is needed.
