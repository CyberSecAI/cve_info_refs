## Description

[![@Hexife](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10476944?u=1b4e4a24c2e74016f69a6e0abe76f7a6ea06f989&v=4&size=48)](/Hexife)[Hexife](https://github.com/Hexife)opened [on Nov 5, 2018](https://github.com/osCommerce/oscommerce2/issues/631#issue-377305890)

**Brief of this vulnerability**

osCommerce use `.htaccess` file for preventing to execute php and html files.

But it is not complete set to preventing all of malicious files.

As the result, Adversary can upload several types of malicious file.

This vulnerability needs the admin credentials, but this vulnerability can be used to compromise web server that osCommerce installed.

**Test Environment**

* Apache/2.4.18 (Debian)
* PHP 5.6.38-2+ubuntu16.04.1+deb.sury.org+1 (cli)

**Tested version**

2.3.4.1 (Downloaded from Official Site)

**Payload & Reason of vulnerability**

0. upload point

* Page : Admin page > Catalog > Categories / Products > New Products
* Upload malicious files via product images elements.
* Found Harmful Files is listed below.

---

1. PHP Code Execution

* Description of vulnerability

  `.htaccess` file located in `http://[ host ip ] /oscommerce2/catalog/images/` directory.

  It prevents to execution of several dangerous extensions.

  But its regular expression do not prevent `pht` extensions.

  As a result, php script with pht extension can be uploaded and executed.

ps. If osCommerce runs on PHP 7.1+ environment, `phar` extension also can be executed in the server.

This vulnerability reserved to [CVE-2018-18572](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pv4c-fq9m-45gm "CVE-2018-18572").

---

2. Handle the arbitrary file to execute as PHP script

* Description of vulnerability

  Upload File filter can not prevent to upload new `.htaccess` file.

  So, adversary can change the `.htaccess` file.

  If `.htaccess` file changed, all of the PHP-supported file can be executed.

  Even file that has arbitrary extension and PHP script can be executed.

This vulnerability reserved to [CVE-2018-18573](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r5xm-pjjm-47rm "CVE-2018-18573").

---

3. Execute HTML using SVG file format

* Description of vulnerability

  `.htaccess` file in `http://[ host ip ] /oscommerce2/catalog/images/` directory banned `html` extension, but there are several extensions that HTML can be executed.

  One of the extension string is `svg`.

  If adversary assemble SVG file and HTML file to SVG file, that assembed SVG file can be execute HTML in client browser.

---

4. Execute HTML using EML file format ( IE only )

* Description of vulnerability

  `.htaccess` file in `http://[ host ip ] /oscommerce2/catalog/images/` directory banned `html` extension, but there are several extensions that HTML can be executed.

  `eml` extention is not executed in other browsers, but only Internet Explorer render HTML elements in `eml` file.

---

5. Execute HTML using Strange file extension or No extension

* Description of vulnerability

  `.htaccess` file in `http://[ host ip ] /oscommerce2/catalog/images/` directory banned `html` extension, but there are several extensions that HTML can be executed.

  The file that has no extension or strange extension can be rendered in web browsers.

---

Vulnerability 1 and 2 are about PHP Code execution via arbitrary file upload, and others are about HTML Execution (related with XSS).

These vulnerabilities needs administrator credentials, but I still think it is vulnerable.

I did not upload test payloads due to abusing problems.

If you needs to fix these vulnerability, please announce me your mail.

Thank you.

## Description

osCommerce 2.3.4.1 has an incomplete '.htaccess' for blacklist filtering in the "product" page. Because of this filter, script files with certain PHP-related extensions (such as .phtml and .php5) didn't execute in the application. But this filter didn't prevent the '.pht' extension. Thus, remote authenticated administrators can upload '.pht' files for arbitrary PHP code execution via a /catalog/admin/categories.php?cPath=&action=new\_product URI.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
