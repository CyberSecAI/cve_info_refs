The provided content is related to CVE-2018-18711.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of CSRF protection in two POST methods within the wuzhicms application, allowing an attacker to change the super administrator's username and password without their consent.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the handling of username and password modification for the super administrator.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can change the super administrator's username and password by tricking the administrator into opening a malicious webpage while logged into the application. This could lead to complete account takeover and compromise of the entire system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that submits a POST request to the vulnerable endpoints.
- This malicious page is then sent to the super administrator.
- When the administrator opens the malicious page while logged in to the vulnerable application, the attacker's crafted form is submitted without the user's knowledge, resulting in modification of username/password.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to know the URL of the vulnerable wuzhicms instance.
- The attacker needs the target user to be logged into the wuzhicms application.
- The attacker needs to trick the target user into opening the malicious webpage.
