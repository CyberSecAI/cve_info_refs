Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-18700:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content from `gcc.gnu.org` directly references "Bug 87681," which describes a stack overflow vulnerability in `cp-demangle.c` within GNU libiberty. This vulnerability is triggered by recursive calls within the `d_name`, `d_encoding`, and `d_local_name` functions.  The Ubuntu Security Notices (USN-4336-1, USN-4326-1) also list CVE-2018-18700 as one of the vulnerabilities fixed, directly linking it to `libiberty`. Therefore, the content is directly related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is excessive recursion in the C++ demangling functions (`d_name`, `d_encoding`, and `d_local_name`) within `cp-demangle.c` in the `libiberty` library.  
-  Specifically, a specially crafted mangled name can cause these functions to call each other recursively without a proper termination condition, leading to stack exhaustion.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stack Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a stack overflow due to uncontrolled recursion in the demangling functions.
- **Lack of Recursion Limit:** The original code lacked a mechanism to limit the depth of recursion in these functions, making it susceptible to specially crafted inputs.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The most direct impact is a denial of service due to the application crashing with a stack overflow. This can occur when an attacker provides a specially crafted binary or mangled name to a program using the vulnerable library.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** The Ubuntu notices mention the possibility of arbitrary code execution. While not explicitly detailed in the bug report, it's possible that a sophisticated attacker could exploit the stack overflow to overwrite return addresses and gain control of the program's execution flow.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- The primary attack vector involves providing a specially crafted mangled name or a binary containing such a mangled name to a program using the vulnerable `libiberty` library, particularly when using tools like `nm -C` (which performs demangling).

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious input (binary or mangled name) to a program or process that uses the vulnerable libiberty library for C++ demangling. This could be through a file that the user or system processes or other external communication channels that process demangled names.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   The `gcc.gnu.org` bug report provides a proof-of-concept (POC) file that triggers the vulnerability.
*   The bug report shows the stack trace generated by ASAN (AddressSanitizer) when the vulnerability is triggered, clearly showing the recursive calls between `d_name`, `d_encoding`, and `d_local_name`.
*   The fix involved adding a recursion limit to the demangling code, which is enabled by default. The limit can be disabled using a new demangling option. This effectively prevents the stack overflow and DoS.
*   The fix also includes changes to handle a mangled string that is so long that there is not enough stack space for local arrays by adding a check and returning a failure result
*   The vulnerability affects versions of GNU binutils and libiberty that do not have the recursion limit fix.
*   The Ubuntu Security Notices indicate that the affected package is `libiberty` and provide patched versions for Ubuntu 18.04 and 16.04.
*  The Ubuntu security notices indicate that `binutils` package is also affected.

**Summary:**

CVE-2018-18700 is a stack overflow vulnerability in the C++ demangling functions of `libiberty`, caused by uncontrolled recursion. Attackers can trigger this by providing specially crafted input to programs that use this library, leading to a denial of service and potentially arbitrary code execution. The fix involves implementing a recursion limit, preventing the stack overflow.
