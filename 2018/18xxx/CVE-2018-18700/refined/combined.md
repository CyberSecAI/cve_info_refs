# USN-4336-1: GNU binutils vulnerabilities

22 April 2020

Several security issues were fixed in GNU binutils.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)

## Packages

* [binutils](/security/cves?package=binutils) - GNU assembler, linker and binary utilities

## Details

issues. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a

specially-crafted file, a remote attacker could cause GNU binutils to

crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary

code.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=87681#c0)  N1705695H    2018-10-22 06:48:08 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 44876](attachment.cgi?id=44876 "POC") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=44876&action=edit "POC") POC  An issue was discovered in cp-demangle.c in GNU libiberty, as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.31. Stack Exhaustion occurs in the C++ demangling functions provided by libiberty, and there is a stack consumption problem caused by recursive stack frames: d_name, d_encoding, and d_local_name.  Please use the "./nm -C $POC" to reproduce the bug. This result can trigger different Stack Overflow, you can try several times.   To reproduce this bug. You need to build bintuils-2.31 with ASAN. Here is the compile Option. Another approach is to set the break Point and debug it, then see the back trace.  > CC=clang LDFLAGS="-ldl" CFLAGS="-DFORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -fstack-protector-all -fsanitize=undefined,address -fno-omit-frame-pointer -g -O0 -Wno-error" ./configure --disable-shared --disable-gdb --disable-libdecnumber --disable-sim  The ASAN dumps the stack trace as follows:  > AddressSanitizer:DEADLYSIGNAL > ================================================================= > ==18186==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: stack-overflow on address 0x7ffeca00cf98 (pc 0x0000008e8b7a bp 0x7ffeca00d080 sp 0x7ffeca00cfa0 T0) >     #0 0x8e8b79 in d_name binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:1411:28 >     #1 0x8dcc1d in d_encoding binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:1312:12 >     #2 0x8ea4d3 in d_local_name binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:3590:14 >     #3 0x8e8b7e in d_name binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:1411:14 >     #4 0x8dcc1d in d_encoding binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:1312:12 >     #5 0x8ea4d3 in d_local_name binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:3590:14 >     #6 0x8e8b7e in d_name binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:1411:14 >     #7 0x8dcc1d in d_encoding binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:1312:12 >     #8 0x8ea4d3 in d_local_name binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:3590:14 >     #9 0x8e8b7e in d_name binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:1411:14 >     #10 0x8dcc1d in d_encoding binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:1312:12 >     #11 0x8ea4d3 in d_local_name binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:3590:14 >     #12 0x8e8b7e in d_name binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:1411:14 >     #13 0x8dcc1d in d_encoding binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:1312:12 >     #14 0x8ea4d3 in d_local_name binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:3590:14 >     #15 0x8e8b7e in d_name binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:1411:14 >     #16 0x8dcc1d in d_encoding binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:1312:12 >     #17 0x8ea4d3 in d_local_name binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:3590:14 >     ... >     #246 0x8e8b7e in d_name binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:1411:14 >     #247 0x8dcc1d in d_encoding binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:1312:12 >     #248 0x8ea4d3 in d_local_name binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:3590:14 >     #249 0x8e8b7e in d_name binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:1411:14 >  SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: stack-overflow binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:1411:28 in d_name >  ==19901==ABORTING >  00000000 AAborted ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=87681#c1)  Nick Clifton    2018-12-07 10:34:02 UTC  ``` Author: nickc Date: Fri Dec  7 10:33:30 2018 New Revision: 266886  URL: <https://gcc.gnu.org/viewcvs?rev=266886&root=gcc&view=rev> Log: Add a recursion limit to libiberty's demangling code.
