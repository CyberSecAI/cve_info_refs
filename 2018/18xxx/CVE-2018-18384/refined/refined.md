  "CVE-2018-18384": {
    "description": "Info-ZIP UnZip 6.0 has a buffer overflow in list.c, when a ZIP archive has a crafted relationship between the compressed-size value and the uncompressed-size value, because a buffer size is 10 and is supposed to be 12.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `list.c` file in Info-ZIP UnZip 6.0 has a buffer overflow vulnerability due to an insufficient buffer size when handling crafted ZIP archives.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer Overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "A successful attack can lead to a denial of service (DoS) due to a crash.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Crafted ZIP archive"
      ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted ZIP archive with a specific relationship between the compressed and uncompressed file sizes.",
      "additional_information": "The vulnerability occurs in the `ratio()` function in `list.c` where the calculated compression ratio is printed to a buffer `cfactorstr` with a size that can be overflowed by a large value. The fix involves increasing the size of the `cfactorstr` buffer and also replacing `sprintf()` with `snprintf()` for added robustness."
