  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2018-18915",
    "details": "The exiv2 packages provide a command line utility which can display and manipulate image metadata such as EXIF, LPTC, and JPEG comments.A flaw was found in Exiv2 0.27-RC1. An infinite loop in the Exiv2::Image::printIFDStructure function of image.cpp. A crafted input will lead to a remote denial of service attack.",

    ],
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an infinite loop in the `Exiv2::Image::printIFDStructure` function within the `image.cpp` file. This loop occurs because the value of `start` in the while loop does not change in specific cases, causing the program to enter an infinite loop.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Infinite loop vulnerability",
       "Denial of Service"
    ],
    "impact": "A crafted input file can cause the application to enter an infinite loop, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The application becomes unresponsive and consumes excessive resources.",
