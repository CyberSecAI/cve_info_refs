A Stored XSS vulnerability has been discovered in version 4.1.0 of AlchemyCMS via the /admin/pictures image field. NOTE: the vendor's position is that this is not a valid report: "The researcher used an authorized cookie to perform the request to a password-protected route. Without that session cookie, the request would have been rejected as unauthorized."
