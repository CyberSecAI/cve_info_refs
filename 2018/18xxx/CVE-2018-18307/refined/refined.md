      "vulnerability": "Potential bypass of authorization checks",
      "details": "The `BaseController` includes a rescue\_from block that handles exceptions. If an exception of type `CanCan::AccessDenied` is caught it calls `permission_denied(exception)`. Otherwise, it calls `exception_handler(exception)`. However, it does not specify how the `permission_denied(exception)` method functions.",
        "weakness": "Improper error handling might lead to bypassing authorization checks if `permission_denied` doesn't correctly handle the exception.",
       "impact": "Unauthorized access to admin functionalities if authorization is not enforced correctly.",
        "attack_vectors": "Manipulating user permissions or application state to trigger access denied exceptions.",
       "capabilities": "An attacker with some knowledge of the system and ability to manipulate user state."

    "resources_controller.rb": {
        "vulnerability": "Insecure parameter handling",
       "details": "The `resource_params` method in `ResourcesController` uses `params.require(resource_handler.namespaced_resource_name).permit!` which permits all parameters. This is explicitly marked as insecure.",
       "weakness": "Mass assignment vulnerability due to permitting all parameters.",

        "vulnerability": "Potential mass assignment vulnerability",
       "details": "The `picture_params` method in `PicturesController` uses `params.require(:picture).permit(:image_file, :upload_hash, :name, :tag_list)` which allows only these parameters to be updated. However, the `update_multiple` function iterates over multiple pictures to update `name` and `tag_list`. There is no mention how are these being updated using strong params.",
