## Description

[![@zelivans](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15815884?u=03087f76aaecbe31de1834cecedf443088ae02a8&v=4&size=48)](/zelivans)[zelivans](https://github.com/zelivans)opened [on Sep 26, 2018](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/issues/2888#issue-363921012)

This is another bug found with the fuzzer. With specific input it's possible to cause an inifinite loop in the `#next_block` method when parsing an asciidoctor file, due to a never breaking `while true` statement.

I think this bug should be prioritized since it can cause a denial of service in programs that rely on asciidoctor. Specifically GitHub is safe since it uses aggressive timeouts in its markup process, although I did later get a 500 error on the GitHub main page for a few hours that I've never seen before. I can't tell if it's related or not.

## Example input

```
::
///::
x

```

And also

```
* x
///::
x

```
## Explanation

In the `#next_block` method there is a `while true` statement that is used for flow control, and meant to execute only once according to its documentation. I provide no PR since I am not sure what is missing from the loop logic. Plus, I personally think it would be good practice to rewrite this and eliminate the use of an infinite loop especially since it is only used for flow control.
