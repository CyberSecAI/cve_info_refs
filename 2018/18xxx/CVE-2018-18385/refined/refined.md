The provided content is related to CVE-2018-18385.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** An infinite loop within the `Parser#next_block` method in Asciidoctor occurs due to a `while true` statement that does not properly terminate under specific input conditions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is the presence of a non-terminating `while true` loop in the parsing logic. This infinite loop is triggered by malformed input.

**Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The program or process parsing the Asciidoctor input will become unresponsive as it gets stuck in the infinite loop.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves supplying crafted Asciidoctor input that triggers the infinite loop. Examples of such input include:

```
::
///::
x
```

and

```
* x
///::
x
```

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to submit or feed the crafted input to an application or system that uses Asciidoctor for parsing. No special permissions or access is required.
