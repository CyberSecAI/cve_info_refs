# USN-4326-1: libiberty vulnerabilities

8 April 2020

Several security issues were fixed in libiberty.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [libiberty](/security/cves?package=libiberty) - library of utility functions used by GNU programs

## Details

It was discovered that libiberty incorrectly handled parsing certain

binaries. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a

specially crafted binary, a remote attacker could use this issue to cause

libiberty to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute

arbitrary code

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [libiberty-dev](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libiberty)
  -
  [20170913-1ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libiberty/20170913-1ubuntu0.1)

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [libiberty-dev](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libiberty)
  -
  [20160215-1ubuntu0.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libiberty/20160215-1ubuntu0.3)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=87681#c0)  N1705695H    2018-10-22 06:48:08 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 44876](attachment.cgi?id=44876 "POC") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=44876&action=edit "POC") POC  An issue was discovered in cp-demangle.c in GNU libiberty, as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.31. Stack Exhaustion occurs in the C++ demangling functions provided by libiberty, and there is a stack consumption problem caused by recursive stack frames: d_name, d_encoding, and d_local_name.  Please use the "./nm -C $POC" to reproduce the bug. This result can trigger different Stack Overflow, you can try several times.   To reproduce this bug. You need to build bintuils-2.31 with ASAN. Here is the compile Option. Another approach is to set the break Point and debug it, then see the back trace.  > CC=clang LDFLAGS="-ldl" CFLAGS="-DFORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -fstack-protector-all -fsanitize=undefined,address -fno-omit-frame-pointer -g -O0 -Wno-error" ./configure --disable-shared --disable-gdb --disable-libdecnumber --disable-sim  The ASAN dumps the stack trace as follows:  > AddressSanitizer:DEADLYSIGNAL > ================================================================= > ==18186==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: stack-overflow on address 0x7ffeca00cf98 (pc 0x0000008e8b7a bp 0x7ffeca00d080 sp 0x7ffeca00cfa0 T0) >     #0 0x8e8b79 in d_name binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:1411:28 >     #1 0x8dcc1d in d_encoding binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:1312:12 >     #2 0x8ea4d3 in d_local_name binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:3590:14 >     #3 0x8e8b7e in d_name binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:1411:14 >     #4 0x8dcc1d in d_encoding binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:1312:12 >     #5 0x8ea4d3 in d_local_name binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:3590:14 >     #6 0x8e8b7e in d_name binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:1411:14 >     #7 0x8dcc1d in d_encoding binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:1312:12 >     #8 0x8ea4d3 in d_local_name binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:3590:14 >     #9 0x8e8b7e in d_name binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:1411:14 >     #10 0x8dcc1d in d_encoding binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:1312:12 >     #11 0x8ea4d3 in d_local_name binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:3590:14 >     #12 0x8e8b7e in d_name binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:1411:14 >     #13 0x8dcc1d in d_encoding binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:1312:12 >     #14 0x8ea4d3 in d_local_name binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:3590:14 >     #15 0x8e8b7e in d_name binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:1411:14 >     #16 0x8dcc1d in d_encoding binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:1312:12 >     #17 0x8ea4d3 in d_local_name binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:3590:14 >     ... >     #246 0x8e8b7e in d_name binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:1411:14 >     #247 0x8dcc1d in d_encoding binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:1312:12 >     #248 0x8ea4d3 in d_local_name binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:3590:14 >     #249 0x8e8b7e in d_name binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:1411:14 >  SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: stack-overflow binutils-2.31/libiberty/./cp-demangle.c:1411:28 in d_name >  ==19901==ABORTING >  00000000 AAborted ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=87681#c1)  Nick Clifton    2018-12-07 10:34:02 UTC  ``` Author: nickc Date: Fri Dec  7 10:33:30 2018 New Revision: 266886  URL: <https://gcc.gnu.org/viewcvs?rev=266886&root=gcc&view=rev> Log: Add a recursion limit to libiberty's demangling code.

Stack Exhaustion occurs in the C++ demangling functions provided by libiberty, and there is a stack consumption problem caused by recursive stack frames: next_is_type_qua() and cplus_demangle_type()  Please use the "./nm -C $POC" to reproduce the bug. This result can trigger different Stack Overflow, you can try several times.  To reproduce this bug. You need to build bintuils-2.31 with ASAN. Here is the compile Option. Another approach is to set the break Point and debug it, as the stack overflow didn't crash the program.  > CC=clang LDFLAGS="-ldl" CFLAGS="-DFORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -fstack-protector-all -fsanitize=undefined,address -fno-omit-frame-pointer -g -O0 -Wno-error" ./configure --disable-shared --disable-gdb --disable-libdecnumber --disable-sim  The ASAN dumps the stack trace as follows:  > ASAN:DEADLYSIGNAL > ================================================================= > ==9864==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: stack-overflow on address 0x7fff9e5c9f58 (pc > 0x0000009684ac bp 0x000000000000 sp 0x7fff9e5c9f58 T0) >     #0 0x9684ab in next_is_type_qual cp-demangle.c:2290 >     #1 0x9684ab in cplus_demangle_type cp-demangle.c:2387 >     #2 0x9684ab in next_is_type_qual cp-demangle.c:2290 >     #3 0x9684ab in cplus_demangle_type cp-demangle.c:2387 >     #4 0x9684ab in next_is_type_qual cp-demangle.c:2290 >     #5 0x9684ab in cplus_demangle_type cp-demangle.c:2387 >     #6 0x9684ab in next_is_type_qual cp-demangle.c:2290 >     #7 0x9684ab in cplus_demangle_type cp-demangle.c:2387 >     #8 0x9684ab in next_is_type_qual cp-demangle.c:2290 >     #9 0x9684ab in cplus_demangle_type cp-demangle.c:2387 >     #10 0x9684ab in next_is_type_qual cp-demangle.c:2290 >     #11 0x9684ab in cplus_demangle_type cp-demangle.c:2387 >     #12 0x9684ab in next_is_type_qual cp-demangle.c:2290 >     #13 0x9684ab in cplus_demangle_type cp-demangle.c:2387 >     #14 0x9684ab in next_is_type_qual cp-demangle.c:2290 >     #15 0x9684ab in cplus_demangle_type cp-demangle.c:2387 >     #16 0x9684ab in next_is_type_qual cp-demangle.c:2290 >     #17 0x9684ab in cplus_demangle_type cp-demangle.c:2387 >     #18 0x9684ab in next_is_type_qual cp-demangle.c:2290 >     #19 0x9684ab in cplus_demangle_type cp-demangle.c:2387 >     #20 0x9684ab in next_is_type_qual cp-demangle.c:2290 >     #21 0x9684ab in cplus_demangle_type cp-demangle.c:2387 >     ... >     # 0xc5800000c22  (<unknown module>)  > SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: stack-overflow cp-demangle.c:2290 in next_is_type_qual > ==9864==ABORTING > 00000000 AAborted ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=87675#c1)  Michael Matz    2018-10-29 14:18:16 UTC  ``` One of usual fuzzer fake CVEs.  This is basically a similar "problem" like initially reported in   <https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=23008> where I actually analyzed it.  The problem is that C++ mangled names have a recursive structure.  For demonstration purposes let's assume that the character 'F' in a mangled name means "here come nested template arguments, described next", then you need to recurse down to decode those nested args, and if the next character is 'F' as well, you just recurse down again.  So a mangled "name" with a million 'F' characters in succession will need a recursion depth of a million.  So, when you feed the demangler such a name a stack overflow is expected. Exactly when the overflow occurs depends on how the demangler is compiled, i.e. how much stack space is needed from one to the next recursion level (sometimes the recursion is tail recursion, so in some compilation modes can even be elided and so lead to non-exhaustion).  Many characters of the mangled names have this property, so there are multiple variants of names that all lead to stack exhaustion, so the fuzzers were able to create many different testcases:  <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=85122> (aka bugzilla [PR23008](show_bug.cgi?id=23008 "RESOLVED FIXED - The charset decoder for UnicodeLittle gives wrong results")) <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=85452> <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=87335> <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=87636> <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=87675> <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=87681>  Unfortunately they now also started to submit fake CVEs for these, like this one (CVE-2018-18701) or CVE-2018-18700 (aka [bug 87681](show_bug.cgi?id=87681 "RESOLVED FIXED - Recursive Stack Overflow within function d_name, d_encoding, and d_local_name in cp-demangle.c, as demonstrated by \"nm -C\"")).  If libiberty ever implements a check for this (which essentially can only be an arbitrary limit, which is frowned upon, especially as it must be very small, as people might have their stack limit set very low) fine, if not, also fine. Until then feeding such names to any demangling tool leads to stack exhaustion and hence segfault.  Like any other memory exhaustion not a security bug. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=87675#c2)  Scott Gayou    2018-11-27 19:38:34 UTC  ``` As Michael said, this seems to be one of a large number of duplicates.  At least CVE-2018-18484, CVE-2018-18701, and CVE-2018-18700 seems to be a duplicates. I can only reproduce one of them via setting a lower ulimit -s, and the crashes all appear to be in cp-demangle.c. The call flows are similar yet slightly different. My guess is that a recursion limit would fix all of these hence they are the same root issue.  If upstream agrees, the duplicate CVE assignments can potentially be rejected. Let me know if anyone else has any evidence or arguments that these are different -- it is possible I made a mistake in the analysis. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=87675#c3)  Scott Gayou    2018-11-27 19:50:30 UTC  ``` My last comment was a bit confusing. I can reproduce 2/3 on a standard system, and the other 1/3 requires dropping ulimit -s down a bit. (to 4096). ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=87675#c4)  N1705695H    2018-12-01 07:01:44 UTC  ``` (In reply to Scott Gayou from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=87675#c3)) > My last comment was a bit confusing. I can reproduce 2/3 on a standard > system, and the other 1/3 requires dropping ulimit -s down a bit. (to 4096).  Hi，  I don't think you've made a clear analysis of the problem. This has nothing to do with how much stack memory you set up. No matter how big your stack memory is, it can still run out. The test case only give a small number of characters. As you can imagine, you can still run out of memory by giving a lot of characters.  In detail, the program requires the amount of resource such as time, memory, power, etc. Memory exhaustion problems in the server can occur circumstantially when programs are provided with inputs that exhibit worst-case behavior. However, the high space complexity of the algorithm or poorly-designed programs consume much more memory than necessary under well-conceived inputs. In particular, stack memory is very limited. An attacker may use own function call or multiple functions to call each other, exhausting stack memory. In other words, no matter how large your stack memory is, it will always run out(by given more "Z" or "U"). No matter how big you set it up, it's ultimately limited.   The problem itself is very difficult to fix. The problem is that C++ mangled names have a recursive structure. Simple restriction cycles are not necessarily good. Moreover, these examples give different stack frames. This is cause by giving different string input. Some are call itself. Some are call different function. In fact, it's hard to set recursive limits on every function. Recursion limit would not fix all of these hence they are different root cause(Loop calls involving six functions in a finite function stack frame). ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=87675#c5)  Nick Clifton    2018-12-07 10:34:02 UTC  ``` Author: nickc Date: Fri Dec  7 10:33:30 2018 New Revision: 266886  URL: <https://gcc.gnu.org/viewcvs?rev=266886&root=gcc&view=rev> Log: Add a recursion limit to libiberty's demangling code.

# USN-4336-1: GNU binutils vulnerabilities

22 April 2020

Several security issues were fixed in GNU binutils.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)

## Packages

* [binutils](/security/cves?package=binutils) - GNU assembler, linker and binary utilities

## Details

It was discovered that GNU binutils contained a large number of security

issues. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a

specially-crafted file, a remote attacker could cause GNU binutils to

crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary

code.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [binutils](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/binutils)
  -
  [2.30-21ubuntu1~18.04.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/binutils/2.30-21ubuntu1~18.04.3)
* [binutils-multiarch](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/binutils)
  -
  [2.30-21ubuntu1~18.04.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/binutils/2.30-21ubuntu1~18.04.3)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.
