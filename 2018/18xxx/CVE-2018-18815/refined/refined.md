- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `DiagnosticDataCipherer` class uses a hard-coded cryptographic key for encrypting user passwords.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Hard-coded cryptographic key, allowing decryption of user passwords.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can decrypt user passwords, potentially leading to authentication bypass when combined with other vulnerabilities.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring authentication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs access to the system where the vulnerable software is installed to access the encrypted passwords.
