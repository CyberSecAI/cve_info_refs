{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by Firefox not properly handling proxy configurations from PAC files, which allows localhost requests to be routed through a proxy server.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of localhost in proxy auto-configuration (PAC) files.",
      "Lack of consistent application of 'No Proxy for' settings across different proxy configurations (Manual, PAC, Auto-detect)."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to potentially conduct attacks on local services and tools that are bound to localhost. This is achieved by serving a malicious PAC file that redirects localhost traffic to an attacker-controlled proxy server, potentially enabling same-origin XHR attacks against the local services.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious actor can serve a rogue PAC file through WPAD (Web Proxy Auto-Discovery) or via manual PAC file configuration.",
      "If a user has enabled proxy auto-detection, the attacker can utilize DHCP responses to point to a WPAD server, and redirect localhost requests.",
       "Manually configured PAC files can also be used."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to serve a malicious PAC file through a web server or control the DHCP responses within a network. This can be achieved on a compromised network, through a malicious local web server, or by tricking the user into manually configuring the malicious PAC URL.",
     "additional_information": "The vulnerability was initially kept hidden as a security bug, similar to how the Chrome team treated their version of the issue (https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=899126) and was disclosed by Project Zero (https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1707)."
