Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-18820:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to multiple buffer overflows in the URL authentication backend of Icecast.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Buffer overflows exist in the code that handles URL authentication.
- Specifically, crafted HTTP headers can trigger these overflows.
- The vulnerable code was introduced in version 2.4.0.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful attack can overwrite the server's stack, causing it to crash.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A malicious client can potentially execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the Icecast process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious HTTP client sends a request to the Icecast server.
- The request includes a crafted header designed to trigger the buffer overflow.
- The vulnerable code is in the URL-based authentication mechanism, so this attack vector requires that feature to be enabled in the Icecast configuration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the Icecast server.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft specific HTTP headers.
- The URL-based authentication must be enabled on the server, which is an advanced feature that is not enabled by default.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Icecast versions 2.4.0, 2.4.1, 2.4.2, and 2.4.3.
- The fix involves addressing the buffer overflows in the URL authentication code.
- A related issue involving buffer overflows in the cURL interface used by URL authentication was also identified, but it is not believed to be directly exploitable.
- Default Icecast installations are not affected since the vulnerable feature (URL authentication) is not enabled by default.
- Patched versions include Icecast 2.4.4, Debian 2.4.2-1+deb9u1 (for stable/stretch), and Debian 2.4.0-1.1+deb8u2 (for oldstable/jessie)
