Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-18619:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data within the `admin.php` file of the Advanced Comment System v1.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection (SQLi): The application fails to properly sanitize the `page` parameter before using it in an SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the underlying database. This could potentially lead to:
    - Data exfiltration: Accessing sensitive information stored in the database.
    - Data modification: Altering or deleting existing data.
    - Privilege escalation: Gaining higher level access by manipulating user roles.
    - Complete compromise of the application and possibly the server, depending on the database permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the HTTP `GET` request by manipulating the `page` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- No specific authentication or local access is required.

**Technical Details:**
- Vulnerable file: `internal/advanced_comment_system/admin.php`
- Vulnerable parameter: `page`
- Example PoC URL: `http://x.x.x.x/internal/advanced_comment_system/admin.php?pw=admin&page=/internal/index.php'%20UNION%20ALL%20SELECT%20NULL,NULL,CONCAT(0x71717a6b71,0x67424663534f77556d44746a59686f78427354754268636b5466486249616b724d716e4869634758,0x7171626a71),NULL--%20SkrU&del=2`
- The PoC demonstrates SQL injection by using a `UNION ALL SELECT` statement to inject malicious SQL into the query.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerable product is discontinued, meaning no patch or fix is available.
- The vulnerability is present in Advanced Comment System v1.0.
- The provided exploit demonstrates a classic SQL injection attack using a `UNION ALL SELECT` clause.
