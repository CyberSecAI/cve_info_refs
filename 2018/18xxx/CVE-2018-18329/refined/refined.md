- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of a user-supplied value before dereferencing it as a pointer within the KERedirect kext.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Untrusted pointer dereference.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute code within the context of the kernel, leading to privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is local, requiring the attacker to have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to execute low-privileged code on the targeted system.
