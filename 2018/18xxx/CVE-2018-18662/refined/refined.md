Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-18662:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read in the `fz_run_t3_glyph` function located in `source/fitz/font.c:1398`.
- The issue occurs when processing Type 3 fonts, specifically when converting them to SVG format.
- The code incorrectly assumes a font is a Type 3 font if `fz_outline_glyph` fails, leading to the out-of-bounds read when it is not a Type 3 font.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Out-of-bounds read:** The `fz_run_t3_glyph` function attempts to read memory outside of allocated buffer when processing certain fonts. This is due to the incorrect assumption of a font being a Type 3 font.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Segmentation fault/Denial of Service (DoS):** The out-of-bounds read causes a segmentation fault, leading to a crash of the application. This results in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious PDF File:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a specially crafted PDF file that contains a font which triggers the incorrect logic.
- **Conversion to SVG:** The issue is triggered when converting the PDF content to SVG format using `mutool draw -F svg`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted PDF file to a vulnerable system that uses MuPDF.
- The attacker needs to invoke the `mutool` utility with the `-F svg` option or any other tool which internally uses `fz_run_t3_glyph` function.

**Additional Notes:**

- The bug was reported by kuaicar87 and assigned bug ID 700043 in the MuPDF bug tracker.
- The fix was implemented in commit 164ddc22ee0d5b63a81d5148f44c37dd132a9356.
- The fix addresses the incorrect assumption that a font is T3 just because fz_outline_glyph fails and added checks to correctly determine Type 3 fonts.
- A proof of concept (POC) PDF file and the problematic code can be found at the following GitHub link: [https://github.com/TeamSeri0us/pocs/blob/master/mupdf/out-of-bound-read-font.c:1397](https://github.com/TeamSeri0us/pocs/blob/master/mupdf/out-of-bound-read-font.c%3A1397)
