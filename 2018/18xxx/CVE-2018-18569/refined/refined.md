Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the Dundas BI application's feature that allows exporting dashboards as images. This feature takes a `viewUrl` parameter, which is a URL, to retrieve the dashboard view. The application does not properly validate or sanitize this URL, enabling an attacker to manipulate it to point to arbitrary internal or external resources.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The application fetches data from a user-controlled URL, without proper validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to force the server to make requests to unintended locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Internal Network Scanning:** The attacker can use the vulnerable server to scan internal networks to identify open ports and services.
- **Internal Service Attacks:** The attacker can leverage the SSRF to attack internal services, specifically HTTP servers, by making requests through the vulnerable application.
- **Data Exfiltration:** The attacker can potentially exfiltrate sensitive data by making requests to external resources and analyzing the server's response, potentially including cookie values.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Manipulating the `viewUrl` parameter:** The attacker modifies the `viewUrl` parameter in the POST request to point to a malicious URL, internal IP addresses, or different ports.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the vulnerable Dundas BI application, typically through a web browser or other HTTP client.
- The attacker does not require access to the internal network from their own machine, as they are leveraging the vulnerable application as a proxy.
- The attacker needs to be able to analyze the response of the vulnerable application to map server responses to network conditions to build an attack plan.

**Additional Details:**
- The blog post details specific error responses and their meanings, which help an attacker map the network.
- The article mentions that a python script can be used to port scan the network.
- The post describes different methods for exploiting the vulnerability such as port scanning, brute forcing internal hostnames, and testing different handlers.
- The post also contains mitigations for SSRF such as input validation, whitelisting, and traffic filtering.
- The vendor released a patch that fixed the vulnerability in version 5.0.1.1010 of the Dundas BI application.
