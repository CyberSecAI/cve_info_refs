- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `mg_mqtt_next_subscribe_topic` function of the Cesanta Mongoose library. This occurs because the function reads the topic string length from an MQTT SUBSCRIBE packet without validating it against the buffer size, which is later used in pointer arithmetic.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-based buffer overflow due to missing bounds check on the topic length within an MQTT SUBSCRIBE packet.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could trigger an out-of-bounds read, which can lead to information disclosure and a denial-of-service condition. By carefully crafting the MQTT packet, an attacker may be able to control the memory layout to leak memory.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can send a specially crafted MQTT SUBSCRIBE packet over the network to a vulnerable Mongoose instance.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to a server running the vulnerable Mongoose library.
