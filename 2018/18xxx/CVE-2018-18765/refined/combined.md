# Cesanta Mongoose MQTT mg\_mqtt\_next\_subscribe\_topic Heap Buffer Overflow

## Summary

* An exploitable arbitrary memory read vulnerability exists in the MQTT packet parsing functionality of Cesanta Mongoose 6.13. A specially crafted MQTT SUBSCRIBE packet can cause an arbitrary out-of=bounds memory read potentially resulting in information disclosure and denial of service. An attacker needs to send a specially crafted MQTT packet over the network to trigger this vulnerability.

## Tested Versions

* Cesanta Mongoose 6.13

## Details

Mongoose is a monolithic library implementing a number of networking protocols, including HTTP, MQTT, MDNS and others. It is designed with embedded devices in mind and as such is used in many IoT devices and runs on virtually all platforms.

While parsing an MQTT packet SUBSCRIBE command, topic string size as encoded in the packet is trusted without any additional validation. This arbitrary length value is used in pointer arithmetic and can cause out-of-bounds memory access. The vulnerability occurs in function `mg_mqtt_next_subscribe_topic`:

```
int mg_mqtt_next_subscribe_topic(struct mg_mqtt_message *msg,
                                 struct mg_str *topic, uint8_t *qos, int pos) {
  unsigned char *buf = (unsigned char *) msg->payload.p + pos;
  int new_pos;

  if ((size_t) pos >= msg->payload.len) return -1;

  topic->len = buf[0] << 8 | buf[1];                     [1]
  topic->p = (char *) buf + 2;
  new_pos = pos + 2 + topic->len + 1;                    [2]
  if ((size_t) new_pos > msg->payload.len) return -1;
  *qos = buf[2 + topic->len];
  return new_pos;
}
```

* In the above code, at [1] two bytes from message buffer are read as `topic->len` and then immediatelly used at [2] to calculate `new_pos`. No check is performed to insure it would be inside the bounds of the buffer which is limited in size. This issue can be triggered multiple times and with careful control of the memory layout could be abused to leak memory and cause denial of service.
* This vulnerability can be triggered by sending bytes from the [proof of concept](/TiffanyBlue/PoCbyMyself/blob/master/mongoose6.13/mqtt/mg_mqtt_next_subscribe_topic.crash) to the sample mqtt\_broker application supplied with the library.
