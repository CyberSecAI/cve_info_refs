Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-18519:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from insecure file permissions assigned to the `syscrb.exe` executable located within the Best Free Keylogger installation directory (`%PROGRAMFILES%\BFK 5.2.9\`). Specifically, the `BUILTIN\Users` group has write permissions on this file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The core issue is the overly permissive file permissions on `syscrb.exe`. This allows any user belonging to the `BUILTIN\Users` group (which includes most standard user accounts on a Windows system) to modify or replace the file.
*   **Executable in Program Files:** The vulnerable file is located within the `Program Files` directory, which is typically intended for application executables. The insecure permission on this executable allows for easy modification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker, even with low-level privileges, can replace the legitimate `syscrb.exe` with a malicious executable. When a user logs in (e.g., via RDP), the replaced executable runs with the logged-in user's privileges, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the victim's account.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker gains the ability to execute any code they choose, essentially taking control of the victim's session. This can lead to a range of malicious activities, such as data theft, further system compromise, or installation of malware.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the machine where Best Free Keylogger is installed.
*   **File Replacement:** The attacker needs to be able to write to the `C:\Program Files\BFK 5.2.9\syscrb.exe` file. This is possible due to the insecure permissions.
*   **User Login:** Exploitation is triggered when a user logs into the system. The vulnerable application is executed as part of the user session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low-Privilege Access:** The attacker does not need administrative rights; a standard user account is sufficient.
*   **File System Access:** The attacker needs the ability to write to the specified file location.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 6.0.0 of the software.
*   The vendor was notified but didn't respond initially, resulting in a public disclosure of the issue.
* The vulnerability was present in version 5.2.9, and possibly earlier versions.
