# BestXsoftware Best Free Keylogger 5.2.9 Privilege Escalation

* *Author*: Martino Sani
* *Release date*: 2018-10-19
* *Software*: <https://bestxsoftware.com/>
* *Version*: 5.2.9 and probably previous versions
* *CVE*: CVE-2018-18519

## Description

BestXsoftware Best Free Keylogger 5.2.9 allows local users to gain privileges via
a Trojan horse `%PROGRAMFILES%\BFK 5.2.9\syscrb.exe` file because of insecure
permissions for the BUILTIN\Users group.

## Attack Vectors

Best Free Keylogger v. 5.2.9 is installed on the system.

The attacker (with arbitrary privileges) replaces the file `C:\Program Files\BFK 5.2.9\syscrb.exe`.
It is world writable (Windows Group: Users).

A victim user opens a session, such as through a RDP client, and
`C:\Program Files\BFK 5.2.9\syscrb.exe` is executed with the logged-in user's privileges.

The attacker can execute arbitrary code impersonating the victim.

## Timeline

* 2018-09-28: Vendor notification. No response.
* 2018-10-10: No responses from the vendor. Disclosure.
* 2019-06-01: Vendor releases a new version (v. 6.0.0) in order to fix the security issue.

The new version can be downloaded on the following link:
<https://bestxsoftware.com/download/installer_trial_6.0.0.exe>

After trying several of products I chose Best Free Keylogger. It's very easy to install and simple to use. It monitors everything I want. And it's the only software that works with Firefox, Chrome Opera, IE and all other browsers. I'm so appreciative to service team. They really have excellent customer service.
