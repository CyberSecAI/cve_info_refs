The provided content reveals a potential backdoor account in the Vmg3312 B10b router firmware version 1.00(AAPP.7).

Specifically, the analysis of the firmware image (100AAPP7D0.bin) shows the presence of a root account with a hardcoded, base64 encoded password within the `etc/default.cfg` file.

*   **Vulnerability:** Hardcoded root password.
*   **Root cause:** Inclusion of a default configuration with a known password in the firmware.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the router's system with root privileges. An attacker could potentially gain full control of the device, modify settings, intercept traffic, or use it as a launchpad for further attacks.
*   **Attack vector:** An attacker could use the extracted username (`root`) and decoded password (`tTn3+Z@!Sr0O+`) to log into the router via SSH, Telnet, or a web interface (if enabled and exposed).
*   **Attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the router and knowledge of the hardcoded credentials.

The additional comments suggest users are attempting to use this information to gain access to their routers, indicating the practical exploitability of this vulnerability.
