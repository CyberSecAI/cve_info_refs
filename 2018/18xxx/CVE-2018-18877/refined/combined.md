[CVE-2018-18876](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-18876) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)).

**3.2.3    [IMPROPER AUTHENTICATION CWE-287](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/287.html)**

An improper authentication vulnerability exists that could allow a possible authentication bypass, allowing an attacker to manipulate the device and cause a denial-of-service condition.

[CVE-2018-18877](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-18877) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

**3.2.4    [IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)**

An improper input validation vulnerability exists allowing an attacker to craft the input in a form that is not expected by the rest of the application, causing a denial-of-service condition and the device to become unavailable.

[CVE-2018-18878](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-18878) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)).

**3.2.5    [IMPROPER CONTROL OF GENERATION OF CODE ('CODE INJECTION') CWE-94](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html)**

John Elder and Tom Westenberg of Applied Risk reported these vulnerabilities to NCCIC.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Columbia Weather Systems has released a firmware update, Version: MS\_2.7.9973, that addresses all the above vulnerabilities found on the Weather MicroServer.

To upgrade Weather MicroServer, please contact Columbia Weather Systems:

Phone: 503-629-0887 or email: support@columbiaweather.com

NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS-CERT website](/ics/) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities
