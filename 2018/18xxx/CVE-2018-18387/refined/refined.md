  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The playSMS daemon executes an `include init.php` within a while loop, creating a vulnerability where a malicious user who can modify `/var/www/html/playsms/init.php` can escalate privileges when the daemon is run as root.",

      "Exploitation of insecure daemon configurations"
