The provided content describes a vulnerability (CVE-2018-18931) in Tightrope Media Systems Carousel <= 7.0.4.104 (and likely newer).

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insecure file permissions on the service executable (`Carousel.Service.exe`). The "NT Authority\Authenticated Users" group has "Modify" permissions to this file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure File Permissions:** The service executable file has insecure permissions allowing modification by authenticated users.
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** The application accepts ZIP files for bulletins, which can be modified to include malicious ASPX files.
- **Improper Path Handling:** The application does not properly handle forward-slash characters in ZIP file paths, leading to files not being extracted. This was bypassed by the attacker by manually changing forward slashes to backslashes in the ZIP archive with a hex editor.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** By replacing the legitimate service executable with a malicious one, the attacker gains SYSTEM level privileges on the targeted system after a service restart.
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful modification of a bulletin ZIP file allowed for the upload of a web shell, and execution of arbitrary commands on the system.
- **Full System Control:** With SYSTEM privileges, the attacker can create user accounts, install software, and modify system configurations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attacker leverages the web interface of the Carousel system to upload malicious ZIP files containing ASPX web shells, and later malicious service executables.
- **File Upload:** The vulnerability is triggered by uploading specially crafted ZIP archives.
- **Service Manipulation:** The attacker gains higher privileges by replacing a service executable with a malicious version.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to the Web Interface:** The attacker needs to be able to access the web interface of the Carousel system.
- **Knowledge of ZIP File Format:** The attacker needs to know the ZIP format to modify paths, along with the path structure of the imported files once uploaded by the application.
- **Ability to Upload Files:** The attacker needs the ability to upload ZIP files through the bulletin management feature.
- **Basic system administration knowledge** Needed to identify and exploit vulnerable service executables.
