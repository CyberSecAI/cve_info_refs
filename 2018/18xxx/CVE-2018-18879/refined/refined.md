Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-18879:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The root cause is an "Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')". This indicates that the application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code that the application will then execute.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Code Injection (CWE-94):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject malicious code into the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system. This could lead to a complete compromise of the device.
*   The impact is rated as High in terms of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (C:H/I:H/A:H), indicating the potential for complete data breaches, system manipulation, and complete loss of access.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable. This means an attacker doesn't need physical access or any prior access to the system to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network-Based Attack:** The attack vector is network based, as indicated by `AV:N` in the CVSS vector string.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Low Skill Level:** The required skill level is low, indicating that the vulnerability is not difficult to exploit.
*   **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not require any existing privileges on the system to exploit this vulnerability (PR:N in CVSS).
*   **No User Interaction:** The attacker doesn't need any user interaction to exploit this (UI:N in CVSS).

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerable product is the Columbia Weather Systems Weather MicroServer, specifically firmware versions MS\_2.6.9900 and prior.
*   The vulnerability is rated with a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8, which is considered critical.

In summary, CVE-2018-18879 involves a code injection vulnerability in Columbia Weather Systems' MicroServer that could allow a remote attacker with low skill to execute arbitrary code on the affected device leading to a complete compromise of the system.
