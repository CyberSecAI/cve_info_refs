Vulnerability -  Unauthenticated Stored XSS:
===================================

Two instances of Unauthenticated Stored XSS issue were identified in
Loadbalancer.org Enterprise VA MAX:

1. Application takes input from Basic Auth (username) and stores it without
any validation in "Apache Error Log".
This instance works only on HTTPS port.

2. It is possible to inject custom JavaScript code by accessing URL like
/?<XSS>.
Such JavaScript is stored in "Apache User Log".
It works on both - HTTP and HTTPS ports.
```

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to validate user-supplied input before storing it in log files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote Code Execution with root privileges.
- **Attack vectors**:
    1. Injecting malicious code through the Basic Auth username field (HTTPS only).
    2. Injecting malicious JavaScript code through the URL (HTTP and HTTPS).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No authentication required, an attacker can send unauthenticated requests to the application.
