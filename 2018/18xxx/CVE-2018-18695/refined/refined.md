Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-18695:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when a malicious file is dragged and dropped into the Report Designer viewer. This suggests a flaw in how the application processes or handles dragged and dropped files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unsafe file handling:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize the dropped file, leading to the ability to control the EIP register.
- **Lack of security mitigations:** The Report Designer application lacks DEP (Data Execution Prevention), ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization), and CFG (Control Flow Guard), which are security features that protect against exploitation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** By controlling the EIP register, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. This could allow an attacker to install malware, steal data, or take control of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Drag and drop:** The vulnerability is triggered through a simple drag-and-drop action in the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **User interaction:** The attacker needs to convince the victim to drag and drop a malicious file into the Report Designer viewer.
- **Malicious file creation:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious file that can control the EIP register.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerable software is identified as "Report Designer" version 5.0, running on Windows 10 Pro and Windows 10 Edu.
- The provided crash information shows the EIP register is overwritten with `61616161` which indicates that the program crashed when trying to execute memory it shouldn't.
- The lack of DEP, ASLR, and CFG makes it easier to exploit.

In summary, CVE-2018-18695 is a critical vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code by dragging and dropping a malicious file into the vulnerable application. The lack of security mitigations significantly increases the risk and ease of exploitation.
