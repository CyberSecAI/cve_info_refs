Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-18718:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a double-free issue in the `add_themes_from_dir` function within `dlg-contact-sheet.c`. Specifically, the buffer is freed twice.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CWE-415: Double Free. The `g_free` function is called twice on the same memory location (`buffer`), leading to a double-free condition.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Double frees can lead to memory corruption, potentially causing a crash or allowing for arbitrary code execution, due to unexpected modifications of memory locations.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `add_themes_from_dir` function. This function handles the loading of themes, and by manipulating the theme loading process, an attacker could trigger the double-free vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to cause the vulnerable code path to be executed. Specifically, they need to be able to trigger the `add_themes_from_dir` function, likely by having a specially crafted theme or file that causes the double `g_free`.
- The provided content does not provide details of the specific input conditions, but in general an attacker would need to be able to supply a malicious theme file to the application.

**Additional Information:**
- The fix for this issue is to set the buffer to `NULL` after the first call to `g_free(buffer)`.
- The vulnerability has been addressed in version `3:3.3.1-2.1+deb8u1` for Debian 8 "Jessie".
- The vulnerability was initially reported by Tianjun Wu.
