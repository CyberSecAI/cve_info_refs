# double-free in the add\_themes\_from\_dir method

There is a suspected double-free bug (<http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/415.html>) with `static void add_themes_from_dir(DialogData *data,GFile *dir,gboolean editable)` in `dlg-contact-sheet.c`. This method involves two successive calls of `g_free(buffer)` (line 354 and 373), and is likely to cause double-free of the buffer.

One possible fix could be directly assigning the buffer to `NULL` after the first call of `g_free(buffer)`.

Package        : gthumb
Version        : 3:3.3.1-2.1+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-18718
Debian Bug     : #912290

CVE-2018-18718 - CWE-415: Double Free
The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially
leading to modification of unexpected memory locations.

There is a suspected double-free bug with
static void add_themes_from_dir() dlg-contact-sheet.c. This method
involves two successive calls of g_free(buffer) (line 354 and 373),
and is likely to cause double-free of the buffer. One possible fix
could be directly assigning the buffer to NULL after the first call
of g_free(buffer). Thanks Tianjun Wu
