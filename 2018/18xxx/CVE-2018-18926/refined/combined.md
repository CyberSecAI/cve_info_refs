* Gitea version (or commit ref): current ([9458880](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/commit/9458880c068c985692a49caf608f0057c73790bf))
* Can you reproduce the bug at <https://try.gitea.io>:

  + [ x] No
  + Not relevant

## Description

Hi, I found a issue just like [gogs/gogs#5469](https://github.com/gogs/gogs/issues/5469).

With gitea's default installation, I can authenticate as arbitrary account. But due to some server configuration, I can't reproduce in <https://try.gitea.io> .

As this is a very severe issue, I won't post details here. Can you give me your email address and I send the details to you?
