The provided content is related to a security issue in Gitea, specifically issue #5140, which is referenced as a remote command execution vulnerability with default installations. However, the content itself does not provide the technical details about the vulnerability.

Based on the provided text, here's what can be extracted:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The user states it's similar to a vulnerability found in Gogs (gogs/gogs#5469), and that they can authenticate as an arbitrary user using the default installation. The vulnerability appears to lead to remote command execution but no details are provided on how this would occur.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is the ability to authenticate as an arbitrary user. This implies an authentication bypass or privilege escalation vulnerability. The user reports that the default Gitea installation is vulnerable.
*  **Impact of exploitation**: The impact is severe, as the user reports they can authenticate as any user, and this is later specified as leading to remote command execution. The original Gogs issue is about being able to use the SSH key import functionality to execute arbitrary commands on the server, which would make sense as a method of achieving remote code execution.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves exploiting a flaw in the default Gitea installation. More information is required to be specific.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need access to the Gitea instance. Details regarding if this needs to be an authenticated user is not specified, however the user states they can authenticate as an arbitrary user due to the vulnerability.

The user reporting the issue refrains from posting details publicly due to the severity and instead attempts to contact the Gitea team directly for specifics. The content suggests that the underlying vulnerability allows for remote command execution, but does not specify how that occurs.
