Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-18380:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a failure to regenerate the PHP session ID after a user logs into the BigTree CMS application. Instead, the application accepts a user-provided session ID, making it vulnerable to session fixation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Session Fixation:** The core vulnerability is session fixation due to the lack of session ID regeneration after login. This allows an attacker to potentially control the session ID.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Session Hijacking:** An attacker who is able to set or obtain a target user's session ID can gain unauthorized access to the application after the target user logs in, thus hijacking the user's session.
- **Privilege Escalation:** In the context of this CMS, this could allow an attacker to gain administrative privileges if they can hijack an administrator's session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The attack can be carried out remotely.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The attacker may use XSS to force a user to use a session controlled by the attacker.
- **Session ID Theft:** The attacker can attempt to steal a valid session ID of a user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to either:
    - Steal a valid session ID.
    - Force a user to use a session ID controlled by the attacker (e.g., through XSS).
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated initially.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in BigTree CMS versions 4.2.23 and earlier.
- The fix was implemented in version 4.2.24 by regenerating session IDs upon login.
- The fix was implemented by adding `session_regenerate_id()` in `core/inc/bigtree/admin.php` in the login functions.
