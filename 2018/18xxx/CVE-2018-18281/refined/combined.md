## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Wen Xu discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the ext4

filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10876](/security/CVE-2018-10876), [CVE-2018-10879](/security/CVE-2018-10879))

Wen Xu discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the ext4 filesystem

implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this to construct

a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-10877](/security/CVE-2018-10877))

Wen Xu discovered that an out-of-bounds write vulnerability existed in the

ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use

this to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10878](/security/CVE-2018-10878), [CVE-2018-10882](/security/CVE-2018-10882))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly ensure that xattr information remained in inode

bodies. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image

that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-10880](/security/CVE-2018-10880))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel could possibly perform an out of bounds write when updating the

journal for an inline file. An attacker could use this to construct a

malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2018-10883](/security/CVE-2018-10883))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the vsock address family

implementation of the Linux kernel that could lead to a use-after-free

condition. A local attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to

expose sensitive information (host machine kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-14625](/security/CVE-2018-14625))

Cfir Cohen discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the

KVM implementation of the Linux kernel, when handling interrupts in

environments where nested virtualization is in use (nested KVM

virtualization is not enabled by default in Ubuntu kernels). A local

attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to gain administrative

privileges in a host machine. ([CVE-2018-16882](/security/CVE-2018-16882))

Jann Horn discovered that the procfs file system implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly restrict the ability to inspect the kernel

stack of an arbitrary task. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-17972](/security/CVE-2018-17972))

Jann Horn discovered that the mremap() system call in the Linux kernel did

not properly flush the TLB when completing, potentially leaving access to a

physical page after it has been released to the page allocator. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash), expose

sensitive information, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-18281](/security/CVE-2018-18281))

Wei Wu discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not

properly ensure that ioapics were initialized. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-19407](/security/CVE-2018-19407))

It was discovered that the debug interface for the Linux kernel's HID

subsystem did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. An

attacker with access to debugfs could use this to cause a denial of service

or possibly gain additional privileges. ([CVE-2018-9516](/security/CVE-2018-9516))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

Debian Bug     : 890034 896911 907581 915229 915231

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2017-18249

    A race condition was discovered in the disk space allocator of
    F2FS. A user with access to an F2FS volume could use this to cause
    a denial of service or other security impact.

CVE-2018-1128, CVE-2018-1129

    The cephx authentication protocol used by Ceph was susceptible to
    replay attacks, and calculated signatures incorrectly. These
    vulnerabilities in the server required changes to authentication
    that are incompatible with existing clients. The kernel's client
    code has now been updated to be compatible with the fixed server.

CVE-2018-3639 (SSB)

    Multiple researchers have discovered that Speculative Store Bypass
    (SSB), a feature implemented in many processors, could be used to
    read sensitive information from another context. In particular,
    code in a software sandbox may be able to read sensitive
    information from outside the sandbox. This issue is also known as
    Spectre variant 4.

    This update adds a further mitigation for this issue in the eBPF
    (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) implementation.

CVE-2018-5391 (FragmentSmack)

    Juha-Matti Tilli discovered a flaw in the way the Linux kernel
    handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote
    attacker can take advantage of this flaw to trigger time and
    calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithms by sending
    specially crafted packets, leading to remote denial of service.

    This was previously mitigated by reducing the default limits on
    memory usage for incomplete fragmented packets. This update
    replaces that mitigation with a more complete fix.

CVE-2018-5848

    The wil6210 wifi driver did not properly validate lengths in scan
    and connection requests, leading to a possible buffer overflow.
    On systems using this driver, a local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability could use this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or potentially for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-12896, CVE-2018-13053

    Team OWL337 reported possible integer overflows in the POSIX
    timer implementation. These might have some security impact.

CVE-2018-13096, CVE-2018-13097, CVE-2018-13100, CVE-2018-14614,
CVE-2018-14616

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported that crafted F2FS volumes
    could trigger a crash (BUG, Oops, or division by zero) and/or
    out-of-bounds memory access. An attacker able to mount such a
    volume could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-13406

    Dr Silvio Cesare of InfoSect reported a potential integer overflow
    in the uvesafb driver. A user with permission to access such a
    device might be able to use this for denial of service or
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-14610, CVE-2018-14611, CVE-2018-14612, CVE-2018-14613

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported that crafted Btrfs volumes
    could trigger a crash (Oops) and/or out-of-bounds memory access.
    An attacker able to mount such a volume could use this to cause a
    denial of service or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-15471 ((XSA-270)

    Felix Wilhelm of Google Project Zero discovered a flaw in the hash
    handling of the xen-netback Linux kernel module. A malicious or
    buggy frontend may cause the (usually privileged) backend to make
    out of bounds memory accesses, potentially resulting in privilege
    escalation, denial of service, or information leaks.

    <https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-270.html>

CVE-2018-16862

    Vasily Averin and Pavel Tikhomirov from Virtuozzo Kernel Team
    discovered that the cleancache memory management feature did not
    invalidate cached data for deleted files. On Xen guests using the
    tmem driver, local users could potentially read data from other
    users' deleted files if they were able to create new files on the
    same volume.

CVE-2018-17972

    Jann Horn reported that the /proc/*/stack files in procfs leaked
    sensitive data from the kernel. These files are now only readable
    by users with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (usually only root)

CVE-2018-18281

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the virtual memory manager
    that can result in a process briefly having access to memory after
    it is freed and reallocated. A local user could possibly exploit
    this for denial of service (memory corruption) or for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2018-18690

    Kanda Motohiro reported that XFS did not correctly handle some
    xattr (extended attribute) writes that require changing the disk
    format of the xattr. A user with access to an XFS volume could use
    this for denial of service.

CVE-2018-18710

    It was discovered that the cdrom driver does not correctly
    validate the parameter to the CDROM_SELECT_DISC ioctl. A user with
    access to a cdrom device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-19407

    Wei Wu reported a potential crash (Oops) in the KVM implementation
    for x86 processors. A user with access to /dev/kvm could use this
    for denial of service.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.144-3.1~deb8u1.  This version also includes fixes for Debian bugs
#890034, #896911, #907581, #915229, and #915231; and other fixes
included in upstream stable updates.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.9 packages.

## Details

USN-3871-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 18.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 18.04 LTS for Ubuntu

16.04 LTS.

Wen Xu discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the ext4

filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10876](/security/CVE-2018-10876), [CVE-2018-10879](/security/CVE-2018-10879))

Wen Xu discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the ext4 filesystem

implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this to construct

a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-10877](/security/CVE-2018-10877))

Wen Xu discovered that an out-of-bounds write vulnerability existed in the

ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use

this to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10878](/security/CVE-2018-10878), [CVE-2018-10882](/security/CVE-2018-10882))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly ensure that xattr information remained in inode

bodies. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image

that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-10880](/security/CVE-2018-10880))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel could possibly perform an out of bounds write when updating the

journal for an inline file. An attacker could use this to construct a

malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2018-10883](/security/CVE-2018-10883))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the vsock address family

implementation of the Linux kernel that could lead to a use-after-free

condition. A local attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to

expose sensitive information (host machine kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-14625](/security/CVE-2018-14625))

Cfir Cohen discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the

KVM implementation of the Linux kernel, when handling interrupts in

environments where nested virtualization is in use (nested KVM

virtualization is not enabled by default in Ubuntu kernels). A local

attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to gain administrative

privileges in a host machine. ([CVE-2018-16882](/security/CVE-2018-16882))

Jann Horn discovered that the procfs file system implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly restrict the ability to inspect the kernel

stack of an arbitrary task. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-17972](/security/CVE-2018-17972))

Jann Horn discovered that the mremap() system call in the Linux kernel did

not properly flush the TLB when completing, potentially leaving access to a

physical page after it has been released to the page allocator. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash), expose

sensitive information, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-18281](/security/CVE-2018-18281))

Wei Wu discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not

properly ensure that ioapics were initialized. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-19407](/security/CVE-2018-19407))

It was discovered that the debug interface for the Linux kernel's HID

subsystem did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. An

attacker with access to debugfs could use this to cause a denial of service

or possibly gain additional privileges. ([CVE-2018-9516](/security/CVE-2018-9516))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.10](/security/notices?release=cosmic)

## Packages

* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems

## Details

Jann Horn discovered that the procfs file system implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly restrict the ability to inspect the kernel

stack of an arbitrary task. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-17972](/security/CVE-2018-17972))

Jann Horn discovered that the mremap() system call in the Linux kernel did

not properly flush the TLB when completing, potentially leaving access to a

physical page after it has been released to the page allocator. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash), expose

sensitive information, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-18281](/security/CVE-2018-18281))

It was discovered that the BPF verifier in the Linux kernel did not

correctly compute numeric bounds in some situations. A local attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-18445](/security/CVE-2018-18445))

Daniel Dadap discovered that the module loading implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly enforce signed module loading when booted with UEFI

Secure Boot in some situations. A local privileged attacker could use this

to execute untrusted code in the kernel. ([CVE-2018-18653](/security/CVE-2018-18653))

Jann Horn discovered that the Linux kernel mishandles mapping UID or GID

ranges inside nested user namespaces in some situations. A local attacker

could use this to bypass access controls on resources outside the

namespace. ([CVE-2018-18955](/security/CVE-2018-18955))

Philipp Wendler discovered that the overlayfs implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly verify the directory contents permissions from

within a unprivileged user namespace. A local attacker could use this to

expose sensitive information (protected file names). ([CVE-2018-6559](/security/CVE-2018-6559))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.10

* [linux-image-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws)
  -
  [4.18.0.1006.6](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws/4.18.0-1006.7)
* [linux-image-4.18.0-1006-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws)
  -
  [4.18.0-1006.7](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws/4.18.0-1006.7)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

XXX MAYBE WITH XXX

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Details

Wen Xu discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the ext4

filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10876](/security/CVE-2018-10876), [CVE-2018-10879](/security/CVE-2018-10879))

Wen Xu discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the ext4 filesystem

implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this to construct

a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-10877](/security/CVE-2018-10877))

Wen Xu discovered that an out-of-bounds write vulnerability existed in the

ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use

this to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10878](/security/CVE-2018-10878), [CVE-2018-10882](/security/CVE-2018-10882))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly ensure that xattr information remained in inode

bodies. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image

that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-10880](/security/CVE-2018-10880))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel could possibly perform an out of bounds write when updating the

journal for an inline file. An attacker could use this to construct a

malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2018-10883](/security/CVE-2018-10883))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the vsock address family

implementation of the Linux kernel that could lead to a use-after-free

condition. A local attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to

expose sensitive information (host machine kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-14625](/security/CVE-2018-14625))

Cfir Cohen discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the

KVM implementation of the Linux kernel, when handling interrupts in

environments where nested virtualization is in use (nested KVM

virtualization is not enabled by default in Ubuntu kernels). A local

attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to gain administrative

privileges in a host machine. ([CVE-2018-16882](/security/CVE-2018-16882))

Jann Horn discovered that the procfs file system implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly restrict the ability to inspect the kernel

stack of an arbitrary task. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-17972](/security/CVE-2018-17972))

Jann Horn discovered that the mremap() system call in the Linux kernel did

not properly flush the TLB when completing, potentially leaving access to a

physical page after it has been released to the page allocator. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash), expose

sensitive information, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-18281](/security/CVE-2018-18281))

Wei Wu discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not

properly ensure that ioapics were initialized. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-19407](/security/CVE-2018-19407))

It was discovered that the debug interface for the Linux kernel's HID

subsystem did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. An

attacker with access to debugfs could use this to cause a denial of service

or possibly gain additional privileges. ([CVE-2018-9516](/security/CVE-2018-9516))

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1686136#c0)  msiddiqu    2019-03-06 19:50:54 UTC  ``` In the Linux kernel before 4.20.14, expand_downwards in mm/mmap.c lacks a check for the mmap minimum address, which makes it easier for attackers to exploit kernel NULL pointer dereferences on non-SMAP platforms. This is related to a capability check for the wrong task.  An upstream patch:  <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=0a1d52994d440e21def1c2174932410b4f2a98a1>  References:  <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1792>  <https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2019/q1/166>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1686136#c1)  msiddiqu    2019-03-06 19:51:11 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1686137](show_bug.cgi?id=1686137 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-9213 kernel: lack of check for mmap minimum address in expand_downwards in mm/mmap.c leads to NULL pointer dereferences exploit on non-SMAP platforms [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1686136#c6)  Wade Mealing    2019-03-12 03:49:15 UTC  ``` Bit of a public update since people have been asking:  The reproducer (and the theory) fails on both Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.  The commit which introduced this flaw is 32e4e6d5cbb0c0e427391635991fe65e17797af8 and it needs to be be present to be exploited correctly.   At this time this commit does not exit in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.    This commit however IS present in the kernel-alt (ARM kernel) for rhel-7 based on 4.10.  However for the exploit to work correctly selinux must be disabled.  Other security mitigation technology will assist in mitigating this flaw from being useful (such as PXN (SMEP like) and PAN (SMAP like)), but are not considered an "absolute" defense, attackers may be able to work around these protection mechanisms.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1686136#c8)  Wade Mealing    2019-03-12 06:04:50 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Enabling selinux prevents the public exploit from working correctly.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1686136#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-04-23 14:30:32 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2019:0831 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0831](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A0831)   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1686136#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-06-17 18:00:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2019:1479 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1479](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A1479)   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1686136#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-06-17 19:56:03 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2019:1480 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1480](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A1480)   ``` |  |

                 CVE-2019-6974 CVE-2019-7221 CVE-2019-7222 CVE-2019-9213

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2016-10741

    A race condition was discovered in XFS that would result in a
    crash (BUG). A local user permitted to write to an XFS volume
    could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-5753

    Further instances of code that was vulnerable to Spectre variant 1
    (bounds-check bypass) have been mitigated.

CVE-2017-13305

    A memory over-read was discovered in the keys subsystem's
    encrypted key type. A local user could use this for denial of
    service or possibly to read sensitive information.

CVE-2018-3639 (SSB)

    Multiple researchers have discovered that Speculative Store Bypass
    (SSB), a feature implemented in many processors, could be used to
    read sensitive information from another context. In particular,
    code in a software sandbox may be able to read sensitive
    information from outside the sandbox. This issue is also known as
    Spectre variant 4.

    This update fixes bugs in the mitigations for SSB for AMD
    processors.

CVE-2018-5848

    The wil6210 wifi driver did not properly validate lengths in scan
    and connection requests, leading to a possible buffer overflow.
    On systems using this driver, a local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability could use this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or potentially for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-5953

    The swiotlb subsystem printed kernel memory addresses to the
    system log, which could help a local attacker to exploit other
    vulnerabilities.

CVE-2018-12896, CVE-2018-13053

    Team OWL337 reported possible integer overflows in the POSIX
    timer implementation. These might have some security impact.

CVE-2018-16862

    Vasily Averin and Pavel Tikhomirov from Virtuozzo Kernel Team
    discovered that the cleancache memory management feature did not
    invalidate cached data for deleted files. On Xen guests using the
    tmem driver, local users could potentially read data from other
    users' deleted files if they were able to create new files on the
    same volume.

CVE-2018-16884

    A flaw was found in the NFS 4.1 client implementation. Mounting
    NFS shares in multiple network namespaces at the same time could
    lead to a user-after-free. Local users might be able to use this
    for denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

    This can be mitigated by disabling unprivileged users from
    creating user namespaces, which is the default in Debian.

CVE-2018-17972

    Jann Horn reported that the /proc/*/stack files in procfs leaked
    sensitive data from the kernel. These files are now only readable
    by users with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (usually only root)

CVE-2018-18281

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the virtual memory manager
    that can result in a process briefly having access to memory after
    it is freed and reallocated. A local user permitted to create
    containers could possibly exploit this for denial of service
    (memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-18690

    Kanda Motohiro reported that XFS did not correctly handle some
    xattr (extended attribute) writes that require changing the disk
    format of the xattr. A user with access to an XFS volume could use
    this for denial of service.

CVE-2018-18710

    It was discovered that the cdrom driver does not correctly
    validate the parameter to the CDROM_SELECT_DISC ioctl. A user with
    access to a cdrom device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-19824

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a use-after-free bug in the
    USB audio driver. A physically present attacker able to attach a
    specially designed USB device could use this for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2018-19985

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a missing bounds check in the
    hso USB serial driver. A physically present user able to attach a
    specially designed USB device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-20169

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered missing bounds checks in the
    USB core. A physically present attacker able to attach a specially
    designed USB device could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-20511

    InfoSect reported an information leak in the AppleTalk IP/DDP
    implemntation. A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could
    use this to read sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-3701

    Muyu Yu and Marcus Meissner reported that the CAN gateway
    implementation allowed the frame length to be modified, typically
    resulting in out-of-bounds memory-mapped I/O writes.  On a system
    with CAN devices present, a local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability in the initial net namespace could use this to cause a
    crash (oops) or other hardware-dependent impact.

CVE-2019-3819

    A potential infinite loop was discovered in the HID debugfs
    interface exposed under /sys/kernel/debug/hid. A user with access
    to these files could use this for denial of service.

    This interface is only accessible to root by default, which fully
    mitigates the issue.

CVE-2019-6974

    Jann Horn reported a use-after-free bug in KVM. A local user
    with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of
    service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-7221

    Jim Mattson and Felix Wilhelm reported a user-after-free bug in
    KVM's nested VMX implementation. On systems with Intel CPUs, a
    local user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

    Nested VMX is disabled by default, which fully mitigates the
    issue.

CVE-2019-7222

    Felix Wilhelm reported an information leak in KVM for x86.
    A local user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to read
    sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-9213

    Jann Horn reported that privileged tasks could cause stack
    segments, including those in other processes, to grow downward to
    address 0. On systems lacking SMAP (x86) or PAN (ARM), this
    exacerbated other vulnerabilities: a null pointer dereference
    could be exploited for privilege escalation rather than only for
    denial of service.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.64-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1705937#c0)  msiddiqu    2019-05-03 09:05:35 UTC  ``` The coredump implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.0.10 does not use locking or other mechanisms to prevent vma layout or vma flags changes while it runs, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information, cause a denial of service, or possibly have unspecified other impact by triggering a race condition with mmget_not_zero or get_task_mm calls. This is related to fs/userfaultfd.c, mm/mmap.c, fs/proc/task_mmu.c, and drivers/infiniband/core/uverbs_main.c.

IB/hfi1: Fix destroy\_qp hang after a link down
commit b4a4957d3d1c328b733fce783b7264996f866ad2 upstream.
rvt\_destroy\_qp() cannot complete until all in process packets have
been released from the underlying hardware. If a link down event
occurs, an application can hang with a kernel stack similar to:
cat /proc//stack
quiesce\_qp+0x178/0x250 [hfi1]
rvt\_reset\_qp+0x23d/0x400 [rdmavt]
rvt\_destroy\_qp+0x69/0x210 [rdmavt]
ib\_destroy\_qp+0xba/0x1c0 [ib\_core]
nvme\_rdma\_destroy\_queue\_ib+0x46/0x80 [nvme\_rdma]
nvme\_rdma\_free\_queue+0x3c/0xd0 [nvme\_rdma]
nvme\_rdma\_destroy\_io\_queues+0x88/0xd0 [nvme\_rdma]
nvme\_rdma\_error\_recovery\_work+0x52/0xf0 [nvme\_rdma]
process\_one\_work+0x17a/0x440
worker\_thread+0x126/0x3c0
kthread+0xcf/0xe0
ret\_from\_fork+0x58/0x90
0xffffffffffffffff
quiesce\_qp() waits until all outstanding packets have been freed.
This wait should be momentary. During a link down event, the cleanup
handling does not ensure that all packets caught by the link down are
flushed properly.
This is caused by the fact that the freeze path and the link down
event is handled the same. This is not correct. The freeze path
waits until the HFI is unfrozen and then restarts PIO. A link down
is not a freeze event. The link down path cannot restart the PIO
until link is restored. If the PIO path is restarted before the link
comes up, the application (QP) using the PIO path will hang (until
link is restored).
Fix by separating the linkdown path from the freeze path and use the
link down path for link down events.
Close a race condition sc\_disable() by acquiring both the progress
and release locks.
Close a race condition in sc\_stop() by moving the setting of the flag
bits under the alloc lock.

i2c: rcar: handle RXDMA HW behaviour on Gen3
commit 2b16fd63059ab9a46d473620749672dc342e1d21 upstream.
On Gen3, we can only do RXDMA once per transfer reliably. For that, we
must reset the device, then we can have RXDMA once. This patch
implements this. When there is no reset controller or the reset fails,
RXDMA will be blocked completely. Otherwise, it will be disabled after
the first RXDMA transfer. Based on a commit from the BSP by Hiromitsu
Yamasaki, yet completely refactored to handle multiple read messages
within one transfer.

drm/i915/glk: Add Quirk for GLK NUC HDMI port issues.
commit 0ca9488193e61ec5f31a631d8147f74525629e8a upstream.
On GLK NUC platforms the HDMI retiming buffer needs additional disabled
time to correctly sync to a faster incoming signal.
When measured on a scope the highspeed lines of the HDMI clock turn off
for ~400uS during a normal resolution change. The HDMI retimer on the
GLK NUC appears to require at least a full frame of quiet time before a
new faster clock can be correctly sync'd. Wait 100ms due to msleep
inaccuracies while waiting for a completed frame. Add a quirk to the
driver for GLK boards that use ITE66317 HDMI retimers.
V2: Add more devices to the quirk list
V3: Delay increased to 100ms, check to confirm crtc type is HDMI.
V4: crtc type check extended to include \_DDI and whitespace fixes
v5: Fix white spaces, remove the macro for delay. Revert the crtc type
check introduced in v4.

drm/i915: Nuke the LVDS lid notifier
commit 05c72e77ccda89ff624108b1b59a0fc43843f343 upstream.
We broke the LVDS notifier resume thing in (presumably) commit
e2c8b8701e2d ("drm/i915: Use atomic helpers for suspend, v2.") as
we no longer duplicate the current state in the LVDS notifier and
thus we never resume it properly either.
Instead of trying to fix it again let's just kill off the lid
notifier entirely. None of the machines tested thus far have
apparently needed it. Originally the lid notifier was added to
work around cases where the VBIOS was clobbering some of the
hardware state behind the driver's back, mostly on Thinkpads.
We now have a few report of Thinkpads working just fine without
the notifier. So maybe it was misdiagnosed originally, or
something else has changed (ACPI video stuff perhaps?).
If we do end up finding a machine where the VBIOS is still causing
problems I would suggest that we first try setting various bits in
the VBIOS scratch registers. There are several to choose from that
may instruct the VBIOS to steer clear.
With the notifier gone we'll also stop looking at the panel status
in ->detect().

ARC: build: Don't set CROSS\_COMPILE in arch's Makefile
commit 40660f1fcee8d524a60b5101538e42b1f39f106d upstream.
There's not much sense in doing that because if user or
his build-system didn't set CROSS\_COMPILE we still may
very well make incorrect guess.
But as it turned out setting CROSS\_COMPILE is not as harmless
as one may think: with recent changes that implemented automatic
discovery of \_\_host\_\_ gcc features unconditional setup of
CROSS\_COMPILE leads to failures on execution of "make xxx\_defconfig"
with absent cross-compiler, for more info see [1].
Set CROSS\_COMPILE as well gets in the way if we want only to build
.dtb's (again with absent cross-compiler which is not really needed
for building .dtb's), see [2].
Note, we had to change LIBGCC assignment type from ":=" to "="
so that is is resolved on its usage, otherwise if it is resolved
at declaration time with missing CROSS\_COMPILE we're getting this
error message from host GCC:
| gcc: error: unrecognized command line option -mmedium-calls
| gcc: error: unrecognized command line option -mno-sdata

ARC: build: Get rid of toolchain check
commit 615f64458ad890ef94abc879a66d8b27236e733a upstream.
This check is very naive: we simply test if GCC invoked without
"-mcpu=XXX" has ARC700 define set. In that case we think that GCC
was built with "--with-cpu=arc700" and has libgcc built for ARC700.
Otherwise if ARC700 is not defined we think that everythng was built
for ARCv2.
But in reality our life is much more interesting.
1. Regardless of GCC configuration (i.e. what we pass in "--with-cpu"
it may generate code for any ARC core).
2. libgcc might be built with explicitly specified "--mcpu=YYY"
That's exactly what happens in case of multilibbed toolchains:
- GCC is configured with default settings
- All the libs built for many different CPU flavors
I.e. that check gets in the way of usage of multilibbed
toolchains. And even non-multilibbed toolchains are affected.
OpenEmbedded also builds GCC without "--with-cpu" because
each and every target component later is compiled with explicitly
set "-mcpu=ZZZ".

mremap: properly flush TLB before releasing the page
commit eb66ae030829605d61fbef1909ce310e29f78821 upstream.
Jann Horn points out that our TLB flushing was subtly wrong for the
mremap() case. What makes mremap() special is that we don't follow the
usual "add page to list of pages to be freed, then flush tlb, and then
free pages". No, mremap() obviously just \_moves\_ the page from one page
table location to another.
That matters, because mremap() thus doesn't directly control the
lifetime of the moved page with a freelist: instead, the lifetime of the
page is controlled by the page table locking, that serializes access to
the entry.
As a result, we need to flush the TLB not just before releasing the lock
for the source location (to avoid any concurrent accesses to the entry),
but also before we release the destination page table lock (to avoid the
TLB being flushed after somebody else has already done something to that
page).
This also makes the whole "need\_flush" logic unnecessary, since we now
always end up flushing the TLB for every valid entry.

But feature fixups applies on code before it is set to read only,

powerpc/tm: Avoid possible userspace r1 corruption on reclaim
[ Upstream commit 96dc89d526ef77604376f06220e3d2931a0bfd58 ]
Current we store the userspace r1 to PACATMSCRATCH before finally
saving it to the thread struct.
In theory an exception could be taken here (like a machine check or
SLB miss) that could write PACATMSCRATCH and hence corrupt the
userspace r1. The SLB fault currently doesn't touch PACATMSCRATCH, but
others do.
We've never actually seen this happen but it's theoretically
possible. Either way, the code is fragile as it is.
This patch saves r1 to the kernel stack (which can't fault) before we
turn MSR[RI] back on. PACATMSCRATCH is still used but only with
MSR[RI] off. We then copy r1 from the kernel stack to the thread
struct once we have MSR[RI] back on.

powerpc/tm: Fix userspace r13 corruption
[ Upstream commit cf13435b730a502e814c63c84d93db131e563f5f ]
When we treclaim we store the userspace checkpointed r13 to a scratch
SPR and then later save the scratch SPR to the user thread struct.
Unfortunately, this doesn't work as accessing the user thread struct
can take an SLB fault and the SLB fault handler will write the same
scratch SPRG that now contains the userspace r13.
To fix this, we store r13 to the kernel stack (which can't fault)
before we access the user thread struct.
Found by running P8 guest + powervm + disable\_1tb\_segments + TM. Seen
as a random userspace segfault with r13 looking like a kernel address.

clocksource/drivers/fttmr010: Fix set\_next\_event handler
[ Upstream commit 4451d3f59f2a6f95e5d205c2d04ea072955d080d ]
Currently, the aspeed MATCH1 register is updated to  in set\_next\_event handler, with the assumption that COUNT
register value is preserved when the timer is disabled and it continues
decrementing after the timer is enabled. But the assumption is wrong:
RELOAD register is loaded into COUNT register when the aspeed timer is
enabled, which means the next event may be delayed because timer
interrupt won't be generated until <0xFFFFFFFF - current\_count +
cycles>.
The problem can be fixed by updating RELOAD register to , and
COUNT register will be re-loaded when the timer is enabled and interrupt
is generated when COUNT register overflows.
The test result on Facebook Backpack-CMM BMC hardware (AST2500) shows
the issue is fixed: without the patch, usleep(100) suspends the process
for several milliseconds (and sometimes even over 40 milliseconds);
after applying the fix, usleep(100) takes averagely 240 microseconds to
return under the same workload level.

scsi: ipr: System hung while dlpar adding primary ipr adapter back
[ Upstream commit 318ddb34b2052f838aa243d07173e2badf3e630e ]
While dlpar adding primary ipr adapter back, driver goes through adapter
initialization then schedule ipr\_worker\_thread to start te disk scan by
dropping the host lock, calling scsi\_add\_device. Then get the adapter reset
request again, so driver does scsi\_block\_requests, this will cause the
scsi\_add\_device get hung until we unblock. But we can't run ipr\_worker\_thread
to do the unblock because its stuck in scsi\_add\_device.
This patch fixes the issue.

drm: mali-dp: Call drm\_crtc\_vblank\_reset on device init
[ Upstream commit 69be1984ded00a11b1ed0888c6d8e4f35370372f ]
Currently, if userspace calls drm\_wait\_vblank before the crtc is
activated the crtc vblank\_enable hook is called, which in case of
malidp driver triggers some warninngs. This happens because on
device init we don't inform the drm core about the vblank state
by calling drm\_crtc\_vblank\_on/off/reset which together with
drm\_vblank\_get have some magic that prevents calling drm\_vblank\_enable
when crtc is off.

PCI: dwc: Fix scheduling while atomic issues
[ Upstream commit 9024143e700f89d74b8cdaf316a3499d74fc56fe ]
When programming the inbound/outbound ATUs, we call usleep\_range() after
each checking PCIE\_ATU\_ENABLE bit. Unfortunately, the ATU programming
can be executed in atomic context:
inbound ATU programming could be called through
pci\_epc\_write\_header()
=>dw\_pcie\_ep\_write\_header()
=>dw\_pcie\_prog\_inbound\_atu()
outbound ATU programming could be called through
pci\_bus\_read\_config\_dword()
=>dw\_pcie\_rd\_conf()
=>dw\_pcie\_prog\_outbound\_atu()
Fix this issue by calling mdelay() instead.

ravb: do not write 1 to reserved bits
[ Upstream commit 2fe397a3959de8a472f165e6d152f64cb77fa2cc ]
EtherAVB hardware requires 0 to be written to status register bits in
order to clear them, however, care must be taken not to:
1. Clear other bits, by writing zero to them
2. Write one to reserved bits
This patch corrects the ravb driver with respect to the second point above.
This is done by defining reserved bit masks for the affected registers and,
after auditing the code, ensure all sites that may write a one to a
reserved bit use are suitably masked.

net: emac: fix fixed-link setup for the RTL8363SB switch
[ Upstream commit 08e39982ef64f800fd1f9b9b92968d14d5fafa82 ]
On the Netgear WNDAP620, the emac ethernet isn't receiving nor
xmitting any frames from/to the RTL8363SB (identifies itself
as a RTL8367RB).
This is caused by the emac hardware not knowing the forced link
parameters for speed, duplex, pause, etc.
This begs the question, how this was working on the original
driver code, when it was necessary to set the phy\_address and
phy\_map to 0xffffffff. But I guess without access to the old
PPC405/440/460 hardware, it's not possible to know.

function batadv\_info to add it at the same time to the kernel ring buffer
and to the batman-adv debug log (when CONFIG\_BATMAN\_ADV\_DEBUG is enabled).
The function batadv\_info requires as first parameter the batman-adv softif
net\_device. This parameter is then used to find the private buffer which
contains the debug log for this batman-adv interface. But
batadv\_store\_throughput\_override used as first argument the slave
net\_device. This slave device doesn't have the batadv\_priv private data
which is access by batadv\_info.
Writing to this file with CONFIG\_BATMAN\_ADV\_DEBUG enabled can either lead
to a segfault or to memory corruption.

number of bytes which the template ELP packet requires.
These extra padding bytes were not initialized and thus could contain data
which were previously stored at the same location. It is therefore required
to set it to some predefined or random values to avoid leaking private

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): 7.7  Upstream has added a way to specify this:  Author: Ming Lei <ming.lei> Date:   Tue Mar 13 17:42:41 2018 +0800      scsi: core: introduce force_blk_mq   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1659146#c2)  Ewan D.

However, there isn't such issue on RHEL7 because of the queue mapping/CPU hotplug handling difference.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1659146#c6)  Ewan D.

With the exception of drivers that individually set use_blk_mq, verify the following:  Boot with scsi_mod.use_blk_mq=N (the default case in RHEL7)   find /sys | fgrep use_blk_mq (to find the sysfs nodes for the individual                                 scsi_host object settings for instantiated                                 hosts, they should be "0" unless a driver                                 has enabled it explicitly)  Boot with scsi_mod.use_blk_mq=Y   find /sys | fgrep use_blk_mq -- sysfs nodes for scsi_host objects should be "1"  (i.e. verify that this change does not force SCSI-MQ "on" or "off" unintentionally for all drivers.)  The actual logic in question that is being changed is in scsi_host_alloc()  -       shost->use_blk_mq = scsi_use_blk_mq && !shost->hostt->disable_blk_mq; +       shost->use_blk_mq = (scsi_use_blk_mq || shost->hostt->force_blk_mq) +                           && !shost->hostt->disable_blk_mq;  Drivers can change shost->use_blk_mq after the alloc but before they add the object, these are the drivers that set use_blk_mq individual by their own module parameters. (We did this with some drivers earlier in RHEL7 that wished to use SCSI-MQ but we did not want to turn on SCSI-MQ for all SCSI drivers that might be in use in the kernel.)  Drivers that set use_blk_mq individually are:   - Infiniband IB/srp -- default module parameter "use_blk_mq" is "Y"   - lpfc driver - default module parameter "use_blk_mq" is "0"   - qla2xxx driver - default module parameter "ql2xmqsupport" is "0"  ---  The reason for this change now is that storvsc will not be running in non-MQ mode, and therefore does not need a module option, it can just set the bit in the host template.  Once the storvsc driver has been updated in RHEL7 to make use of this functionality to set .force_blk_mq = 1 in the scsi_host_template, it should always report "use_blk_mq" in the scsi_host object in sysfs regardless of the scsi_mod.use_blk_mq setting.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1659146#c8)  Bruno Meneguele    2019-03-08 20:48:35 UTC  ``` Patch(es) committed on kernel-3.10.0-1017.el7   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1659146#c11)  guazhang@redhat.com    2019-05-08 07:32:03 UTC  ``` Hello  RHEL7.7 mq regression test passed. so move to verified.  thanks guazhang   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1659146#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-08-06 12:24:26 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1709164#c0)  Marian Rehak    2019-05-13 06:35:55 UTC  ``` In the Linux kernel before 5.0.7. a NULL pointer dereference can occur when megasas_create_frame_pool() fails in megasas_alloc_cmds() in drivers/scsi/megaraid/megaraid_sas_base.c. leading to Denial of Service, related to a use-after-free.  Upstream Patch:  <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=bcf3b67d16a4c8ffae0aa79de5853435e683945c>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1709164#c1)  Justin M.

This would be when the module is unloaded/loaded or loaded the first time when the system is booted.  The upstream patch refers to this being a use-after-free (which could at some stage be abused to some kind of memory-corruption or possible further unknown effects.  The timing window for server-grade hardware to attack this is actually quite minimal and its unlikely that network services are available during the time when this code would be run (usually during boot).  It might be possible that this module is loaded post boot (when a privileged user unloads and reloads the module.  The small window of opportunity to exploit this flaw significantly increases its complexity for a local attacker to successfully exploit.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1709164#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-07-30 09:42:16 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2019:1959 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1959](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A1959)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1709164#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-07-30 11:02:09 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2019:1971 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1971](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A1971)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1709164#c14)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-07-30 13:18:33 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

Hello, Yes, this flaw is going to be fixed in RHEL7. Unfortunately, there is no mitigation as the flaw is in the kernel's core memory management subsystem code. On the other hand we rate this flaw as Moderate severity, as for the moment of this writing there is no known exploit or reproducer or proof-of-concept for RHEL-7.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1645121#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-04-23 14:30:32 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2019:0831 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0831](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A0831)   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1645121#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-08-06 12:04:27 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2019:2029 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2029](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2029)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1645121#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-08-06 12:06:51 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2019:2043 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2043](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2043)   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1645121#c18)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-01-07 12:26:19 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2020:0036 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0036](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A0036)   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1645121#c19)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-01-14 08:04:51 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2  Via RHSA-2020:0100 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0100](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A0100)   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1645121#c20)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-01-14 15:53:11 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 Advanced Update Support   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 Update Services for SAP Solutions   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 Telco Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2020:0103 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0103](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A0103)   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1645121#c21)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-01-21 17:01:56 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2020:0179 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0179](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A0179)   ``` |  |

ARC: build: Don't set CROSS\_COMPILE in arch's Makefile
commit 40660f1fcee8d524a60b5101538e42b1f39f106d upstream.
There's not much sense in doing that because if user or
his build-system didn't set CROSS\_COMPILE we still may
very well make incorrect guess.
But as it turned out setting CROSS\_COMPILE is not as harmless
as one may think: with recent changes that implemented automatic
discovery of \_\_host\_\_ gcc features unconditional setup of
CROSS\_COMPILE leads to failures on execution of "make xxx\_defconfig"
with absent cross-compiler, for more info see [1].
Set CROSS\_COMPILE as well gets in the way if we want only to build
.dtb's (again with absent cross-compiler which is not really needed
for building .dtb's), see [2].
Note, we had to change LIBGCC assignment type from ":=" to "="
so that is is resolved on its usage, otherwise if it is resolved
at declaration time with missing CROSS\_COMPILE we're getting this
error message from host GCC:
| gcc: error: unrecognized command line option -mmedium-calls
| gcc: error: unrecognized command line option -mno-sdata

ARC: build: Get rid of toolchain check
commit 615f64458ad890ef94abc879a66d8b27236e733a upstream.
This check is very naive: we simply test if GCC invoked without
"-mcpu=XXX" has ARC700 define set. In that case we think that GCC
was built with "--with-cpu=arc700" and has libgcc built for ARC700.
Otherwise if ARC700 is not defined we think that everythng was built
for ARCv2.
But in reality our life is much more interesting.
1. Regardless of GCC configuration (i.e. what we pass in "--with-cpu"
it may generate code for any ARC core).
2. libgcc might be built with explicitly specified "--mcpu=YYY"
That's exactly what happens in case of multilibbed toolchains:
- GCC is configured with default settings
- All the libs built for many different CPU flavors
I.e. that check gets in the way of usage of multilibbed
toolchains. And even non-multilibbed toolchains are affected.
OpenEmbedded also builds GCC without "--with-cpu" because
each and every target component later is compiled with explicitly
set "-mcpu=ZZZ".

mremap: properly flush TLB before releasing the page
commit eb66ae030829605d61fbef1909ce310e29f78821 upstream.
Jann Horn points out that our TLB flushing was subtly wrong for the
mremap() case. What makes mremap() special is that we don't follow the
usual "add page to list of pages to be freed, then flush tlb, and then
free pages". No, mremap() obviously just \_moves\_ the page from one page
table location to another.
That matters, because mremap() thus doesn't directly control the
lifetime of the moved page with a freelist: instead, the lifetime of the
page is controlled by the page table locking, that serializes access to
the entry.
As a result, we need to flush the TLB not just before releasing the lock
for the source location (to avoid any concurrent accesses to the entry),
but also before we release the destination page table lock (to avoid the
TLB being flushed after somebody else has already done something to that
page).
This also makes the whole "need\_flush" logic unnecessary, since we now
always end up flushing the TLB for every valid entry.

x86/boot: Fix kexec booting failure in the SEV bit detection code
[ Upstream commit bdec8d7fa55e6f5314ed72e5a0b435d90ff90548 ]
Commit
1958b5fc4010 ("x86/boot: Add early boot support when running with SEV active")
can occasionally cause system resets when kexec-ing a second kernel even
if SEV is not active.
That's because get\_sev\_encryption\_bit() uses 32-bit rIP-relative
addressing to read the value of enc\_bit - a variable which caches a
previously detected encryption bit position - but kexec may allocate
the early boot code to a higher location, beyond the 32-bit addressing
limit.
In this case, garbage will be read and get\_sev\_encryption\_bit() will
return the wrong value, leading to accessing memory with the wrong
encryption setting.
Therefore, remove enc\_bit, and thus get rid of the need to do 32-bit
rIP-relative addressing in the first place.

powerpc/numa: Use associativity if VPHN hcall is successful
[ Upstream commit 2483ef056f6e42f61cd266452e2841165dfe1b5c ]
Currently associativity is used to lookup node-id even if the
preceding VPHN hcall failed. However this can cause CPU to be made
part of the wrong node, (most likely to be node 0). This is because
VPHN is not enabled on KVM guests.
With 2ea6263 ("powerpc/topology: Get topology for shared processors at
boot"), associativity is used to set to the wrong node. Hence KVM
guest topology is broken.
For example : A 4 node KVM guest before would have reported.
[root@localhost ~]# numactl -H
available: 4 nodes (0-3)
node 0 cpus: 0 1 2 3

2: 40 40 10 40
3: 40 40 40 10
Would now report:

powerpc/tm: Avoid possible userspace r1 corruption on reclaim
[ Upstream commit 96dc89d526ef77604376f06220e3d2931a0bfd58 ]
Current we store the userspace r1 to PACATMSCRATCH before finally
saving it to the thread struct.
In theory an exception could be taken here (like a machine check or
SLB miss) that could write PACATMSCRATCH and hence corrupt the
userspace r1. The SLB fault currently doesn't touch PACATMSCRATCH, but
others do.
We've never actually seen this happen but it's theoretically
possible. Either way, the code is fragile as it is.
This patch saves r1 to the kernel stack (which can't fault) before we
turn MSR[RI] back on. PACATMSCRATCH is still used but only with
MSR[RI] off. We then copy r1 from the kernel stack to the thread
struct once we have MSR[RI] back on.

powerpc/tm: Fix userspace r13 corruption
[ Upstream commit cf13435b730a502e814c63c84d93db131e563f5f ]
When we treclaim we store the userspace checkpointed r13 to a scratch
SPR and then later save the scratch SPR to the user thread struct.
Unfortunately, this doesn't work as accessing the user thread struct
can take an SLB fault and the SLB fault handler will write the same
scratch SPRG that now contains the userspace r13.
To fix this, we store r13 to the kernel stack (which can't fault)
before we access the user thread struct.
Found by running P8 guest + powervm + disable\_1tb\_segments + TM. Seen
as a random userspace segfault with r13 looking like a kernel address.

pinctrl/amd: poll InterruptEnable bits in amd\_gpio\_irq\_set\_type
[ Upstream commit b85bfa246efd24ea3fdb5ee949c28e3110c6d299 ]
>From the AMD BKDG, if WAKE\_INT\_MASTER\_REG.MaskStsEn is set, a software
write to the debounce registers of \*any\* gpio will block wake/interrupt
status generation for \*all\* gpios for a length of time that depends on
WAKE\_INT\_MASTER\_REG.MaskStsLength[11:0]. During this period the Interrupt
Delivery bit (INTERRUPT\_ENABLE) will read as 0.
In commit 4c1de0414a1340 ("pinctrl/amd: poll InterruptEnable bits in
enable\_irq") we tried to fix this same "gpio Interrupts are blocked
immediately after writing debounce registers" problem, but incorrectly
assumed it only affected the gpio whose debounce was being configured
and not ALL gpios.
To solve this for all gpios, we move the polling loop from
amd\_gpio\_irq\_enable() to amd\_gpio\_irq\_set\_type(), while holding the gpio
spinlock. This ensures that another gpio operation (e.g.
amd\_gpio\_irq\_unmask()) can read a temporarily disabled IRQ and
incorrectly disable it while trying to modify some other register bits.

clocksource/drivers/fttmr010: Fix set\_next\_event handler
[ Upstream commit 4451d3f59f2a6f95e5d205c2d04ea072955d080d ]
Currently, the aspeed MATCH1 register is updated to  in set\_next\_event handler, with the assumption that COUNT
register value is preserved when the timer is disabled and it continues
decrementing after the timer is enabled. But the assumption is wrong:
RELOAD register is loaded into COUNT register when the aspeed timer is
enabled, which means the next event may be delayed because timer
interrupt won't be generated until <0xFFFFFFFF - current\_count +
cycles>.
The problem can be fixed by updating RELOAD register to , and
COUNT register will be re-loaded when the timer is enabled and interrupt
is generated when COUNT register overflows.
The test result on Facebook Backpack-CMM BMC hardware (AST2500) shows
the issue is fixed: without the patch, usleep(100) suspends the process
for several milliseconds (and sometimes even over 40 milliseconds);
after applying the fix, usleep(100) takes averagely 240 microseconds to
return under the same workload level.

bpf: sockmap, fix transition through disconnect without close
[ Upstream commit b05545e15e1ff1d6a6a8593971275f9cc3e6b92b ]
It is possible (via shutdown()) for TCP socks to go trough TCP\_CLOSE
state via tcp\_disconnect() without actually calling tcp\_close which
would then call our bpf\_tcp\_close() callback. Because of this a user
could disconnect a socket then put it in a LISTEN state which would
break our assumptions about sockets always being ESTABLISHED state.
To resolve this rely on the unhash hook, which is called in the
disconnect case, to remove the sock from the sockmap.

After this patch we only allow socks that are in ESTABLISHED state or

ESTABLISHED state. By allowing sock\_ops events we allow users to
manage sockmaps directly from sock ops programs. The two supported
sock\_ops ops are BPF\_SOCK\_OPS\_PASSIVE\_ESTABLISHED\_CB and
BPF\_SOCK\_OPS\_ACTIVE\_ESTABLISHED\_CB.
Similar to TLS ULP this ensures sk\_user\_data is correct.

In multi-function mode, driver receives the stag value (outer vlan)

the driver load, then the stag is not notified to the driver and hence
driver will have the invalid stag value.

net/smc: fix non-blocking connect problem
[ Upstream commit 648a5a7aed346c3b8fe7c32a835edfb0dfbf4451 ]
In state SMC\_INIT smc\_poll() delegates polling to the internal
CLC socket. This means, once the connect worker has finished
its kernel\_connect() step, the poll wake-up may occur. This is not
intended. The wake-up should occur from the wake up call in
smc\_connect\_work() after \_\_smc\_connect() has finished.
Thus in state SMC\_INIT this patch now calls sock\_poll\_wait() on the
main SMC socket.

EtherAVB hardware requires 0 to be written to status register bits in
order to clear them, however, care must be taken not to:
1. Clear other bits, by writing zero to them
2. Write one to reserved bits
This patch corrects the ravb driver with respect to the second point above.
This is done by defining reserved bit masks for the affected registers and,
after auditing the code, ensure all sites that may write a one to a
reserved bit use are suitably masked.

net: emac: fix fixed-link setup for the RTL8363SB switch

On the Netgear WNDAP620, the emac ethernet isn't receiving nor
xmitting any frames from/to the RTL8363SB (identifies itself
as a RTL8367RB).
This is caused by the emac hardware not knowing the forced link
parameters for speed, duplex, pause, etc.
This begs the question, how this was working on the original
driver code, when it was necessary to set the phy\_address and
phy\_map to 0xffffffff. But I guess without access to the old
PPC405/440/460 hardware, it's not possible to know.

batman-adv: fix hardif\_neigh refcount on queue\_work() failure
[ Upstream commit 4c4af6900844ab04c9434c972021d7b48610e06a ]
The hardif\_neigh refcounter is to be decreased by the queued work and
currently is never decreased if the queue\_work() call fails.
Fix by checking the queue\_work() return value and decrease refcount
if necessary.

batman-adv: Prevent duplicated tvlv handler
[ Upstream commit ae3cdc97dc10c7a3b31f297dab429bfb774c9ccb ]
The function batadv\_tvlv\_handler\_register is responsible for adding new
tvlv\_handler to the handler\_list. It first checks whether the entry
already is in the list or not. If it is, then the creation of a new entry
is aborted.
But the lock for the list is only held when the list is really modified.
This could lead to duplicated entries because another context could create
an entry with the same key between the check and the list manipulation.
The check and the manipulation of the list must therefore be in the same
locked code section.

batman-adv: Fix segfault when writing to sysfs elp\_interval
[ Upstream commit a25bab9d723a08bd0bdafb1529faf9094c690b70 ]
The per hardif sysfs file "batman\_adv/elp\_interval" is using the generic
functions to store/show uint values. The helper \_\_batadv\_store\_uint\_attr
requires the softif net\_device as parameter to print the resulting change
as info text when the users writes to this file. It uses the helper
function batadv\_info to add it at the same time to the kernel ring buffer
and to the batman-adv debug log (when CONFIG\_BATMAN\_ADV\_DEBUG is enabled).
The function batadv\_info requires as first parameter the batman-adv softif
net\_device. This parameter is then used to find the private buffer which
contains the debug log for this batman-adv interface. But
batadv\_store\_throughput\_override used as first argument the slave
net\_device. This slave device doesn't have the batadv\_priv private data
which is access by batadv\_info.
Writing to this file with CONFIG\_BATMAN\_ADV\_DEBUG enabled can either lead
to a segfault or to memory corruption.

batman-adv: Avoid probe ELP information leak
[ Upstream commit 88d0895d0ea9d4431507d576c963f2ff9918144d ]
The probe ELPs for WiFi interfaces are expanded to contain at least
BATADV\_ELP\_MIN\_PROBE\_SIZE bytes. This is usually a lot more than the
number of bytes which the template ELP packet requires.
These extra padding bytes were not initialized and thus could contain data
which were previously stored at the same location. It is therefore required
to set it to some predefined or random values to avoid leaking private
information from the system transmitting these kind of packets.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1671913#c0)  Prasad Pandit    2019-02-02 06:11:14 UTC  ``` A use after free issue was found in the way Linux kernel's KVM hypervisor implements its device control API. While creating a device via kvm_ioctl_create_device(), device holds a reference to a VM object, latter this reference is transferred to caller's file descriptor table. If such file descriptor was to be closed, reference count to the VM object could become zero, potentially leading to use-after-free issue latter.   A user/process could use this flaw to crash the guest VM resulting in DoS issue OR potentially gain privileged access to a system.

mremap: properly flush TLB before releasing the pageJann Horn points out that our TLB flushing was subtly wrong for the
mremap() case. What makes mremap() special is that we don't follow the
usual "add page to list of pages to be freed, then flush tlb, and then
free pages". No, mremap() obviously just \_moves\_ the page from one page
table location to another.
That matters, because mremap() thus doesn't directly control the
lifetime of the moved page with a freelist: instead, the lifetime of the
page is controlled by the page table locking, that serializes access to
the entry.
As a result, we need to flush the TLB not just before releasing the lock
for the source location (to avoid any concurrent accesses to the entry),
but also before we release the destination page table lock (to avoid the
TLB being flushed after somebody else has already done something to that
page).
This also makes the whole "need\_flush" logic unnecessary, since we now
always end up flushing the TLB for every valid entry.

# USN-3880-2: Linux kernel (Trusty HWE) vulnerabilities

4 February 2019

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-trusty](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-trusty) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Trusty for Precise ESM

## Details

USN-3880-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 14.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 14.04 LTS for Ubuntu

12.04 ESM.

It was discovered that the CIFS client implementation in the Linux kernel

did not properly handle setup negotiation during session recovery, leading

to a NULL pointer exception. An attacker could use this to create a

malicious CIFS server that caused a denial of service (client system

crash). ([CVE-2018-1066](/security/CVE-2018-1066))

Jann Horn discovered that the procfs file system implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly restrict the ability to inspect the kernel

stack of an arbitrary task. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-17972](/security/CVE-2018-17972))

Jann Horn discovered that the mremap() system call in the Linux kernel did

not properly flush the TLB when completing, potentially leaving access to a

physical page after it has been released to the page allocator. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash), expose

sensitive information, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-18281](/security/CVE-2018-18281))

It was discovered that the socket implementation in the Linux kernel

contained a type confusion error that could lead to memory corruption. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-9568](/security/CVE-2018-9568))

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.13.0-165-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-165.215~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-165.215~precise1)
* [linux-image-generic-lpae-lts-trusty](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0.165.155](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-165.215~precise1)
* [linux-image-generic-lts-trusty](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0.165.155](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-165.215~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.13.0-165-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-165.215~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-165.215~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

HV: properly delay KVP packets when negotiation is in progress
commit a3ade8cc474d848676278660e65f5af1e9e094d9 upstream.
The host may send multiple negotiation packets
(due to timeout) before the KVP user-mode daemon
is connected. KVP user-mode daemon is connected.
We need to defer processing those packets
until the daemon is negotiated and connected.
It's okay for guest to respond
to all negotiation packets.
In addition, the host may send multiple staged
KVP requests as soon as negotiation is done.
We need to properly process those packets using one
tasklet for exclusive access to ring buffer.
This patch is based on the work of
Nick Meier .
The above is the original changelog of
a3ade8cc474d ("HV: properly delay KVP packets when negotiation is in progress"
Here I re-worked the original patch because the mainline version
can't work for the linux-4.4.y branch, on which channel->callback\_event
doesn't exist yet. In the mainline, channel->callback\_event was added by:
631e63a9f346 ("vmbus: change to per channel tasklet"). Here we don't want
to backport it to v4.4, as it requires extra supporting changes and fixes,
which are unnecessary as to the KVP bug we're trying to resolve.
NOTE: before this patch is used, we should cherry-pick the other related
3 patches from the mainline first:
The background of this backport request is that: recently Wang Jian reported
some KVP issues: https://github.com/LIS/lis-next/issues/593:
e.g. the /var/lib/hyperv/.kvp\_pool\_\* files can not be updated, and sometimes
if the hv\_kvp\_daemon doesn't timely start, the host may not be able to query
the VM's IP address via KVP.

ext4: avoid running out of journal credits when appending to an inline file
commit 8bc1379b82b8e809eef77a9fedbb75c6c297be19 upstream.
Use a separate journal transaction if it turns out that we need to
convert an inline file to use an data block. Otherwise we could end
up failing due to not having journal credits.
This addresses CVE-2018-10883.

sched/cputime: Fix ksoftirqd cputime accounting regression
commit 25e2d8c1b9e327ed260edd13169cc22bc7a78bc6 upstream.
irq\_time\_read() returns the irqtime minus the ksoftirqd time. This
is necessary because irq\_time\_read() is used to substract the IRQ time
from the sum\_exec\_runtime of a task. If we were to include the softirq
time of ksoftirqd, this task would substract its own CPU time everytime
it updates ksoftirqd->sum\_exec\_runtime which would therefore never
progress.
But this behaviour got broken by:
a499a5a14db ("sched/cputime: Increment kcpustat directly on irqtime account")
... which now includes ksoftirqd softirq time in the time returned by
irq\_time\_read().
This has resulted in wrong ksoftirqd cputime reported to userspace
through /proc/stat and thus "top" not showing ksoftirqd when it should
after intense networking load.
ksoftirqd->stime happens to be correct but it gets scaled down by
sum\_exec\_runtime through task\_cputime\_adjusted().
To fix this, just account the strict IRQ time in a separate counter and
use it to report the IRQ time.

sched/cputime: Increment kcpustat directly on irqtime account
commit a499a5a14dbd1d0315a96fc62a8798059325e9e6 upstream.
The irqtime is accounted is nsecs and stored in
cpu\_irq\_time.hardirq\_time and cpu\_irq\_time.softirq\_time. Once the
accumulated amount reaches a new jiffy, this one gets accounted to the
kcpustat.
This was necessary when kcpustat was stored in cputime\_t, which could at
worst have jiffies granularity. But now kcpustat is stored in nsecs
so this whole discretization game with temporary irqtime storage has
become unnecessary.
We can now directly account the irqtime to the kcpustat.

sched/cputime: Convert kcpustat to nsecs
commit 7fb1327ee9b92fca27662f9b9d60c7c3376d6c69 upstream.
Kernel CPU stats are stored in cputime\_t which is an architecture
defined type, and hence a bit opaque and requiring accessors and mutators
for any operation.
Converting them to nsecs simplifies the code and is one step toward
the removal of cputime\_t in the core code.

usb: gadget: serial: fix oops when data rx'd after close
commit daa35bd95634a2a2d72d1049c93576a02711cb1a upstream.
When the gadget serial device has no associated TTY, do not pass any
received data into the TTY layer for processing; simply drop it instead.
This prevents the TTY layer from calling back into the gadget serial
driver, which will then crash in e.g. gs\_write\_room() due to lack of
gadget serial device to TTY association (i.e. a NULL pointer dereference).

HID: quirks: fix support for Apple Magic Keyboards
Commit b6cc0ba2cbf4 (HID: add support for Apple Magic Keyboards)
backported support for the Magic Keyboard over Bluetooth, but did not
add the BT\_VENDOR\_ID\_APPLE to hid\_have\_special\_driver[] so the hid-apple
driver is never loaded and Fn key does not work at all.
Adding BT\_VENDOR\_ID\_APPLE to hid\_have\_special\_driver[] is not needed
after commit e04a0442d33b (HID: core: remove the absolute need of
hid\_have\_special\_driver[]), so 4.16 kernels and newer does not need it.

ARC: build: Don't set CROSS\_COMPILE in arch's Makefile
commit 40660f1fcee8d524a60b5101538e42b1f39f106d upstream.
There's not much sense in doing that because if user or
his build-system didn't set CROSS\_COMPILE we still may
very well make incorrect guess.
But as it turned out setting CROSS\_COMPILE is not as harmless
as one may think: with recent changes that implemented automatic
discovery of \_\_host\_\_ gcc features unconditional setup of
CROSS\_COMPILE leads to failures on execution of "make xxx\_defconfig"
with absent cross-compiler, for more info see [1].
Set CROSS\_COMPILE as well gets in the way if we want only to build
.dtb's (again with absent cross-compiler which is not really needed
for building .dtb's), see [2].
Note, we had to change LIBGCC assignment type from ":=" to "="
so that is is resolved on its usage, otherwise if it is resolved
at declaration time with missing CROSS\_COMPILE we're getting this
error message from host GCC:
| gcc: error: unrecognized command line option -mmedium-calls
| gcc: error: unrecognized command line option -mno-sdata

ARC: build: Get rid of toolchain check
commit 615f64458ad890ef94abc879a66d8b27236e733a upstream.
This check is very naive: we simply test if GCC invoked without
"-mcpu=XXX" has ARC700 define set. In that case we think that GCC
was built with "--with-cpu=arc700" and has libgcc built for ARC700.
Otherwise if ARC700 is not defined we think that everythng was built
for ARCv2.
But in reality our life is much more interesting.
1. Regardless of GCC configuration (i.e. what we pass in "--with-cpu"
it may generate code for any ARC core).
2. libgcc might be built with explicitly specified "--mcpu=YYY"
That's exactly what happens in case of multilibbed toolchains:
- GCC is configured with default settings
- All the libs built for many different CPU flavors
I.e. that check gets in the way of usage of multilibbed
toolchains. And even non-multilibbed toolchains are affected.
OpenEmbedded also builds GCC without "--with-cpu" because
each and every target component later is compiled with explicitly
set "-mcpu=ZZZ".

netfilter: check for seqadj ext existence before adding it in nf\_nat\_setup\_info
commit ab6dd1beac7be3c17f8bf3d38bdf29ecb7293f1e upstream.
Commit 4440a2ab3b9f ("netfilter: synproxy: Check oom when adding synproxy
and seqadj ct extensions") wanted to drop the packet when it fails to add
seqadj ext due to no memory by checking if nfct\_seqadj\_ext\_add returns
NULL.
But that nfct\_seqadj\_ext\_add returns NULL can also happen when seqadj ext
already exists in a nf\_conn. It will cause that userspace protocol doesn't
work when both dnat and snat are configured.
Li Shuang found this issue in the case:
Topo:
ftp client router ftp server
10.167.131.2 <-> 10.167.131.254 10.167.141.254 <-> 10.167.141.1
Rules:
# iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth1 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 21 -j \
DNAT --to-destination 10.167.141.1
# iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth2 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 21 -j \
SNAT --to-source 10.167.141.254
In router, when both dnat and snat are added, nf\_nat\_setup\_info will be
called twice. The packet can be dropped at the 2nd time for DNAT due to
seqadj ext is already added at the 1st time for SNAT.
This patch is to fix it by checking for seqadj ext existence before adding
it, so that the packet will not be dropped if seqadj ext already exists.
Note that as Florian mentioned, as a long term, we should review ext\_add()
behaviour, it's better to return a pointer to the existing ext instead.

mremap: properly flush TLB before releasing the page
commit eb66ae030829605d61fbef1909ce310e29f78821 upstream.
Jann Horn points out that our TLB flushing was subtly wrong for the
mremap() case. What makes mremap() special is that we don't follow the
usual "add page to list of pages to be freed, then flush tlb, and then
free pages". No, mremap() obviously just \_moves\_ the page from one page
table location to another.
That matters, because mremap() thus doesn't directly control the
lifetime of the moved page with a freelist: instead, the lifetime of the
page is controlled by the page table locking, that serializes access to
the entry.
As a result, we need to flush the TLB not just before releasing the lock
for the source location (to avoid any concurrent accesses to the entry),
but also before we release the destination page table lock (to avoid the
TLB being flushed after somebody else has already done something to that
page).
This also makes the whole "need\_flush" logic unnecessary, since we now
always end up flushing the TLB for every valid entry.

powerpc/tm: Avoid possible userspace r1 corruption on reclaim
[ Upstream commit 96dc89d526ef77604376f06220e3d2931a0bfd58 ]
Current we store the userspace r1 to PACATMSCRATCH before finally
saving it to the thread struct.
In theory an exception could be taken here (like a machine check or
SLB miss) that could write PACATMSCRATCH and hence corrupt the
userspace r1. The SLB fault currently doesn't touch PACATMSCRATCH, but
others do.
We've never actually seen this happen but it's theoretically
possible. Either way, the code is fragile as it is.
This patch saves r1 to the kernel stack (which can't fault) before we
turn MSR[RI] back on. PACATMSCRATCH is still used but only with
MSR[RI] off. We then copy r1 from the kernel stack to the thread
struct once we have MSR[RI] back on.

powerpc/tm: Fix userspace r13 corruption
[ Upstream commit cf13435b730a502e814c63c84d93db131e563f5f ]
When we treclaim we store the userspace checkpointed r13 to a scratch
SPR and then later save the scratch SPR to the user thread struct.
Unfortunately, this doesn't work as accessing the user thread struct
can take an SLB fault and the SLB fault handler will write the same
scratch SPRG that now contains the userspace r13.
To fix this, we store r13 to the kernel stack (which can't fault)
before we access the user thread struct.
Found by running P8 guest + powervm + disable\_1tb\_segments + TM. Seen
as a random userspace segfault with r13 looking like a kernel address.

Currently, if userspace calls drm\_wait\_vblank before the crtc is

device init we don't inform the drm core about the vblank state

1. Clear other bits, by writing zero to them
2. Write one to reserved bits
This patch corrects the ravb driver with respect to the second point above.
This is done by defining reserved bit masks for the affected registers and,
after auditing the code, ensure all sites that may write a one to a

batman-adv: Prevent duplicated nc\_node entry
[ Upstream commit fa122fec8640eb7186ce5a41b83a4c1744ceef8f ]
The function batadv\_nc\_get\_nc\_node is responsible for adding new nc\_nodes
to the in\_coding\_list and out\_coding\_list. It first checks whether the
entry already is in the list or not. If it is, then the creation of a new
entry is aborted.
But the lock for the list is only held when the list is really modified.
This could lead to duplicated entries because another context could create
an entry with the same key between the check and the list manipulation.
The check and the manipulation of the list must therefore be in the same
locked code section.

batman-adv: Fix segfault when writing to sysfs elp\_interval
[ Upstream commit a25bab9d723a08bd0bdafb1529faf9094c690b70 ]
The per hardif sysfs file "batman\_adv/elp\_interval" is using the generic
functions to store/show uint values. The helper \_\_batadv\_store\_uint\_attr
requires the softif net\_device as parameter to print the resulting change
as info text when the users writes to this file. It uses the helper
function batadv\_info to add it at the same time to the kernel ring buffer
and to the batman-adv debug log (when CONFIG\_BATMAN\_ADV\_DEBUG is enabled).
The function batadv\_info requires as first parameter the batman-adv softif
net\_device. This parameter is then used to find the private buffer which
contains the debug log for this batman-adv interface. But
batadv\_store\_throughput\_override used as first argument the slave
net\_device. This slave device doesn't have the batadv\_priv private data
which is access by batadv\_info.
Writing to this file with CONFIG\_BATMAN\_ADV\_DEBUG enabled can either lead
to a segfault or to memory corruption.

media: af9035: prevent buffer overflow on write
[ Upstream commit 312f73b648626a0526a3aceebb0a3192aaba05ce ]
When less than 3 bytes are written to the device, memcpy is called with
negative array size which leads to buffer overflow and kernel panic. This
patch adds a condition and returns -EOPNOTSUPP instead.

From: Jann Horn <jannh@...gle.com>

Subject: Linux kernel: TLB flush happens too late on mremap (CVE-2018-18281;
 fixed in 4.9.135, 4.14.78, 4.18.16, 4.19)

NOTE: I have requested a CVE identifier, and I'm sending this message,
to make tracking of the fix easier; however, to avoid missing security
fixes without CVE identifiers, you should *NOT* be cherry-picking a
specific patch in response to a notification about a kernel security
bug.

Since Linux kernel version 3.2, the mremap() syscall performs TLB
flushes after dropping pagetable locks. If a syscall such as
ftruncate() removes entries from the pagetables of a task that is in
the middle of mremap(), a stale TLB entry can remain for a short time
that permits access to a physical page after it has been released back
to the page allocator and reused.

This is CVE-2018-18281.

This is fixed in the following kernel versions:
4.9.135
4.14.78
4.18.16
4.19

<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=eb66ae030829605d61fbef1909ce310e29f78821>

Debian Bug     : 925919

The linux update issued as DLA-1731-1 caused a regression in the
vmxnet3 (VMware virtual network adapter) driver.  This update corrects
that regression, and an earlier regression in the CIFS network
filesystem implementation introduced in DLA-1422-1.  For reference the
original advisory text follows.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2016-10741

    A race condition was discovered in XFS that would result in a
    crash (BUG). A local user permitted to write to an XFS volume
    could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-5753

    Further instances of code that was vulnerable to Spectre variant 1
    (bounds-check bypass) have been mitigated.

CVE-2017-13305

    A memory over-read was discovered in the keys subsystem's
    encrypted key type. A local user could use this for denial of
    service or possibly to read sensitive information.

CVE-2018-3639 (SSB)

    Multiple researchers have discovered that Speculative Store Bypass
    (SSB), a feature implemented in many processors, could be used to
    read sensitive information from another context. In particular,
    code in a software sandbox may be able to read sensitive
    information from outside the sandbox. This issue is also known as
    Spectre variant 4.

    This update fixes bugs in the mitigations for SSB for AMD
    processors.

CVE-2018-5848

    The wil6210 wifi driver did not properly validate lengths in scan
    and connection requests, leading to a possible buffer overflow.
    On systems using this driver, a local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability could use this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or potentially for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-5953

    The swiotlb subsystem printed kernel memory addresses to the
    system log, which could help a local attacker to exploit other
    vulnerabilities.

CVE-2018-12896, CVE-2018-13053

    Team OWL337 reported possible integer overflows in the POSIX
    timer implementation. These might have some security impact.

CVE-2018-16862

    Vasily Averin and Pavel Tikhomirov from Virtuozzo Kernel Team
    discovered that the cleancache memory management feature did not
    invalidate cached data for deleted files. On Xen guests using the
    tmem driver, local users could potentially read data from other
    users' deleted files if they were able to create new files on the
    same volume.

CVE-2018-16884

    A flaw was found in the NFS 4.1 client implementation. Mounting
    NFS shares in multiple network namespaces at the same time could
    lead to a user-after-free. Local users might be able to use this
    for denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

    This can be mitigated by disabling unprivileged users from
    creating user namespaces, which is the default in Debian.

CVE-2018-17972

    Jann Horn reported that the /proc/*/stack files in procfs leaked
    sensitive data from the kernel. These files are now only readable
    by users with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (usually only root)

CVE-2018-18281

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the virtual memory manager
    that can result in a process briefly having access to memory after
    it is freed and reallocated. A local user permitted to create
    containers could possibly exploit this for denial of service
    (memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-18690

    Kanda Motohiro reported that XFS did not correctly handle some
    xattr (extended attribute) writes that require changing the disk
    format of the xattr. A user with access to an XFS volume could use
    this for denial of service.

CVE-2018-18710

    It was discovered that the cdrom driver does not correctly
    validate the parameter to the CDROM_SELECT_DISC ioctl. A user with
    access to a cdrom device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-19824

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a use-after-free bug in the
    USB audio driver. A physically present attacker able to attach a
    specially designed USB device could use this for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2018-19985

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a missing bounds check in the
    hso USB serial driver. A physically present user able to attach a
    specially designed USB device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-20169

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered missing bounds checks in the
    USB core. A physically present attacker able to attach a specially
    designed USB device could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-20511

    InfoSect reported an information leak in the AppleTalk IP/DDP
    implemntation. A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could
    use this to read sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-3701

    Muyu Yu and Marcus Meissner reported that the CAN gateway
    implementation allowed the frame length to be modified, typically
    resulting in out-of-bounds memory-mapped I/O writes.  On a system
    with CAN devices present, a local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability in the initial net namespace could use this to cause a
    crash (oops) or other hardware-dependent impact.

CVE-2019-3819

    A potential infinite loop was discovered in the HID debugfs
    interface exposed under /sys/kernel/debug/hid. A user with access
    to these files could use this for denial of service.

    This interface is only accessible to root by default, which fully
    mitigates the issue.

CVE-2019-6974

    Jann Horn reported a use-after-free bug in KVM. A local user
    with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of
    service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-7221

    Jim Mattson and Felix Wilhelm reported a user-after-free bug in
    KVM's nested VMX implementation. On systems with Intel CPUs, a
    local user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

    Nested VMX is disabled by default, which fully mitigates the
    issue.

CVE-2019-7222

    Felix Wilhelm reported an information leak in KVM for x86.
    A local user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to read
    sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-9213

    Jann Horn reported that privileged tasks could cause stack
    segments, including those in other processes, to grow downward to
    address 0. On systems lacking SMAP (x86) or PAN (ARM), this
    exacerbated other vulnerabilities: a null pointer dereference
    could be exploited for privilege escalation rather than only for
    denial of service.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.64-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.10](/security/notices?release=cosmic)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel
* [linux-gcp](/security/cves?package=linux-gcp) - Linux kernel for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) systems
* [linux-kvm](/security/cves?package=linux-kvm) - Linux kernel for cloud environments
* [linux-raspi2](/security/cves?package=linux-raspi2) - Linux kernel for Raspberry Pi 2

## Details

Jann Horn discovered that the procfs file system implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly restrict the ability to inspect the kernel

stack of an arbitrary task. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-17972](/security/CVE-2018-17972))

Jann Horn discovered that the mremap() system call in the Linux kernel did

not properly flush the TLB when completing, potentially leaving access to a

physical page after it has been released to the page allocator. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash), expose

sensitive information, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-18281](/security/CVE-2018-18281))

It was discovered that the BPF verifier in the Linux kernel did not

correctly compute numeric bounds in some situations. A local attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-18445](/security/CVE-2018-18445))

Daniel Dadap discovered that the module loading implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly enforce signed module loading when booted with UEFI

Secure Boot in some situations. A local privileged attacker could use this

to execute untrusted code in the kernel. ([CVE-2018-18653](/security/CVE-2018-18653))

Jann Horn discovered that the Linux kernel mishandles mapping UID or GID

ranges inside nested user namespaces in some situations. A local attacker

could use this to bypass access controls on resources outside the

namespace. ([CVE-2018-18955](/security/CVE-2018-18955))

Philipp Wendler discovered that the overlayfs implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly verify the directory contents permissions from

within a unprivileged user namespace. A local attacker could use this to

expose sensitive information (protected file names). ([CVE-2018-6559](/security/CVE-2018-6559))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Details

Wen Xu discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the ext4

filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10876](/security/CVE-2018-10876), [CVE-2018-10879](/security/CVE-2018-10879))

Wen Xu discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the ext4 filesystem

implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this to construct

a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-10877](/security/CVE-2018-10877))

Wen Xu discovered that an out-of-bounds write vulnerability existed in the

ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use

this to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10878](/security/CVE-2018-10878), [CVE-2018-10882](/security/CVE-2018-10882))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly ensure that xattr information remained in inode

bodies. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image

that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-10880](/security/CVE-2018-10880))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel could possibly perform an out of bounds write when updating the

journal for an inline file. An attacker could use this to construct a

malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2018-10883](/security/CVE-2018-10883))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the vsock address family

implementation of the Linux kernel that could lead to a use-after-free

condition. A local attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to

expose sensitive information (host machine kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-14625](/security/CVE-2018-14625))

Cfir Cohen discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the

KVM implementation of the Linux kernel, when handling interrupts in

environments where nested virtualization is in use (nested KVM

virtualization is not enabled by default in Ubuntu kernels). A local

attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to gain administrative

privileges in a host machine. ([CVE-2018-16882](/security/CVE-2018-16882))

Jann Horn discovered that the procfs file system implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly restrict the ability to inspect the kernel

stack of an arbitrary task. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-17972](/security/CVE-2018-17972))

Jann Horn discovered that the mremap() system call in the Linux kernel did

not properly flush the TLB when completing, potentially leaving access to a

physical page after it has been released to the page allocator. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash), expose

sensitive information, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-18281](/security/CVE-2018-18281))

Wei Wu discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not

properly ensure that ioapics were initialized. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-19407](/security/CVE-2018-19407))

It was discovered that the debug interface for the Linux kernel's HID

subsystem did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. An

attacker with access to debugfs could use this to cause a denial of service

or possibly gain additional privileges. ([CVE-2018-9516](/security/CVE-2018-9516))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-1037-azure](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-signed-azure)

* [linux-image-4.15.0-1037-azure](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-signed-azure)
  -
  [4.15.0-1037.39~14.04.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-signed-azure/4.15.0-1037.39~14.04.2)
* [linux-image-azure](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-azure)
  -
  [4.15.0.1037.24](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-azure/4.15.0.1037.24)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Details

It was discovered that the CIFS client implementation in the Linux kernel

did not properly handle setup negotiation during session recovery, leading

to a NULL pointer exception. An attacker could use this to create a

malicious CIFS server that caused a denial of service (client system

crash). ([CVE-2018-1066](/security/CVE-2018-1066))

Jann Horn discovered that the procfs file system implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly restrict the ability to inspect the kernel

stack of an arbitrary task. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-17972](/security/CVE-2018-17972))

Jann Horn discovered that the mremap() system call in the Linux kernel did

not properly flush the TLB when completing, potentially leaving access to a

physical page after it has been released to the page allocator. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash), expose

sensitive information, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-18281](/security/CVE-2018-18281))

It was discovered that the socket implementation in the Linux kernel

contained a type confusion error that could lead to memory corruption. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-9568](/security/CVE-2018-9568))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.
