Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-18883:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an incorrect default value within Xen when handling nested virtualization for HVM (Hardware Virtual Machine) guests on Intel x86 systems. When nested virtualization is intended to be disabled for a guest, a faulty default value causes Xen to incorrectly believe that the virtual configuration procedure has already been completed. This allows the guest to execute virtualization instructions without proper configuration.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Default Value:**  A faulty default value leads Xen to believe the configuration procedure for VT-x instructions has been completed even when it has not for the guest.
*   **Uninitialized Data Usage:** When a guest executes VT-x instructions without correct configuration, it causes Xen to operate on uninitialized data.
*   **Missing #UD exception:** Xen should respond with a #UD exception when a guest attempts to use virtualization instructions without following the correct procedure, but it fails to do so when nested virtualization is disabled due to the incorrect default.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most immediate impact is a NULL pointer dereference within Xen, leading to a host Denial of Service. This occurs because Xen operates on uninitialized memory, which is zeroed out.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** The advisory also indicates that other behaviors, such as memory corruption or privilege escalation, cannot be ruled out.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious HVM Guest:** An attacker with control over an HVM guest can trigger the vulnerability by executing virtualization instructions without proper setup.
*  **Blind Instruction Execution:** The vulnerability is triggered by guest software that "blindly plays" with VT-x instructions without following proper configuration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **HVM Guest Control:** The attacker must have control of a HVM guest running on a vulnerable Xen hypervisor.
*   **Intel x86 Architecture:** The target system must be an Intel x86-based system.

**Vulnerable Systems:**

*   Xen versions 4.9 and later are vulnerable. Xen 4.8 and earlier are not affected.
*   Only Intel x86 systems are affected. Systems from other x86 vendors and other hardware vendors are not vulnerable.
*   Only x86 HVM and PVH (Paravirtualized Hardware) guests can trigger the vulnerability; PV guests are not vulnerable.

**Mitigation:**
*  Running only x86 PV guests will avoid the issue.
*  Applying the provided patch will resolve the vulnerability. Enabling nested virtualization for the affected guests will work around the specific DoS, but it is not a security-supported configuration.
