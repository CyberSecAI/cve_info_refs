Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-18335:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a heap buffer overflow in the Skia graphics library. Specifically, the issue arises from an integer overflow during path handling within Skia.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Buffer Overflow:** A memory corruption vulnerability. Data can be written beyond the allocated buffer boundaries in the heap memory, leading to unpredictable behavior.
*   **Integer Overflow:** An integer overflow occurs during the processing of paths by Skia. This overflow leads to the buffer overflow vulnerability.
*   **Use-After-Free (indirect):** The integer overflow and buffer overflow are identified to cause a use-after-free vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Heap Corruption:** Successful exploitation could lead to heap memory corruption.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can potentially exploit the heap corruption to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. The document does not state whether exploitation is guaranteed.
*   **Denial of Service:** A crash can potentially be triggered via a specially crafted HTML page.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** This is a remote vulnerability exploitable via a specially crafted HTML page.
*   **Network:** As a remote vulnerability, the attack vector is a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to serve or have the victim browse a crafted HTML page.
*   The attacker does not require prior authentication.
*   The attacker doesn't require a privileged position.
