- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper access control to a service command.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper access control allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the system through a crafted message.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access and execute arbitrary code on the affected device. This could result in complete compromise of the device, including modification of settings or potentially impacting its functionality.
- **Attack vectors:** Adjacent network access is required. Attackers send a crafted message to the vulnerable service interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device. The attack requires low skill level to execute and no authentication is needed.
