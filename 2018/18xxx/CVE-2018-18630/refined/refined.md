- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insecure file permissions in the default installation of Change Healthcare Cardiology devices.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect default permissions (CWE-276). The vulnerability exists due to overly permissive file permissions during the default installation, allowing unauthorized access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution by allowing a locally authenticated attacker to insert specially crafted files.
- **Attack vectors:** Local system access is required for the attacker to insert malicious files. The vulnerability is not remotely exploitable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local system access and the ability to authenticate to the system to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker does not need to be a high-skilled attacker.
