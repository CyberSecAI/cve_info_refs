[**CVE-2018-18476.md**](#file-cve-2018-18476-md)

# Vulnerability

`mysql-binuuid-rails` is vulnerable to SQL injection: `Model.where(uuid: "ff' OR ''='")` turns into:

```
SELECT  `model`.* FROM `model` WHERE `model`.`uuid` = x'ff' OR ''='' LIMIT 11

```
# Root cause

ActiveRecord does not explicitly escape the Binary data type (`Type::Binary::Data`) for mysql. The escaping is implicit as the `Binary` data type always converts it’s value to a hex string for ActiveRecord to use.

`mysql-binuuid-rails` uses a data type that is derived from the base `Binary` type, *except*, it doesn’t convert the value to hex. Instead, it assumes the string value provided *is* a valid hex string and doesn’t do any checks on it.

# Vulnerable versions

`mysql-binuuid-rails` <= 1.1.0

# Credits

The issue was worked on by Stan Pitucha, Geoff Evason, Emmanuel Joubaud from Envato

# Refs

CVE-2018-18476 - <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-18476>
