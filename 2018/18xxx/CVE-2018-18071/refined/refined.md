The provided content does not directly relate to a specific CVE, but rather provides a detailed analysis of the Mercedes Connected Vehicle API and potential security risks associated with it. Therefore, this response will focus on the security issues discussed in the article, which are relevant to the general topic of vehicle security and API vulnerabilities, rather than addressing CVE-2018-18071 specifically.

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

*   **API Design and Implementation:** The experimental Mercedes Connected Vehicle API, while offering convenient features, introduces potential vulnerabilities due to its design and implementation. This includes the use of standard technologies like HTTP, REST, OAuth, and JSON, which, if not implemented securely, can be exploited.
*   **Networked Nature of Vehicles:** The constant connectivity of vehicles to the internet makes them susceptible to various attacks, similar to other IoT devices.
*   **Lack of Robust Security Measures:** The article suggests that while key pinning might be used during the initial authentication, the subsequent data exchange is vulnerable to interception and manipulation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** The communication between the Mercedes me app and the server can be interrupted through flooding or redirects, potentially preventing users from using crucial functions like locking the car.
*   **Sniffing and Replay Attacks:** Once the communication is authenticated, an attacker can intercept and read the data exchange using a web proxy. They can then use this information to perform replay attacks, simulating the access token until it expires.
*   **API Vulnerabilities:** The API itself might have logical or programming errors that could be exploited, similar to other networked devices.
*   **Privacy Concerns:** The constant connection allows manufacturers to track vehicle location and access status information, raising privacy concerns.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Vehicle Theft:** By interrupting the locking process (DoS) or by remotely unlocking the car, attackers can facilitate vehicle theft.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Intercepted and manipulated API requests could potentially lead to the modification of vehicle settings or data.
*   **Privacy Violations:** Tracking of vehicle location and access to personal data.
*   **Loss of Control:** The ability to disable vehicle functions remotely, whether for safety or other reasons, presents a potential loss of control for the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** Attackers can use a web proxy to intercept and manipulate communication between the Mercedes me app and the Mercedes servers.
*   **Replay Attacks:** Stolen access tokens can be replayed to perform unauthorized actions.
*   **Exploitation of API Vulnerabilities:** Direct attacks on the API itself to leverage logical or programming flaws.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers need to be able to intercept network traffic between the app and the server (e.g., by being on the same Wi-Fi network or using a compromised network).
*   **Technical Expertise:** Attackers need technical knowledge to use tools like web proxies, understand the API protocols, and craft malicious requests.
*   **Knowledge of API Endpoints and Authentication Mechanisms:** Attackers need to understand how the API works to successfully exploit it.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The article emphasizes the importance of treating connected vehicles like mobile computers within the context of the "Internet of Things".
*   The automotive industry is moving towards higher safety standards, which should positively influence vehicle security, but the long-term security of vehicles and their software at "end-of-life" is also a concern.
*   The article highlights the need for legislators to create fair and sustainable standards for both consumers and manufacturers related to security.
