Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-18993:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability present in the Omron CX-One software when processing project files. The application does not properly validate the size of input data, allowing an attacker to exceed the buffer limits.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121): Input data is not properly validated, which can lead to a buffer overflow during project file processing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the security context of the application.
- The impact includes potential loss of confidentiality (C:L), integrity (I:L), and high availability (A:H).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves a specially crafted project file. The attacker needs to craft a malicious project file that contains the overflow data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to get a malicious project file onto the targeted system or have the victim open it.
- The attacker does not require special privileges on the system (PR:N).
- User interaction is required (UI:R), as the user has to open the malicious file.
- The attack is local (AV:L).
