The provided content describes a memory leak vulnerability, but it is not related to CVE-2018-18482, as the CVE is a placeholder.

Based on the provided information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a memory leak in `pg_query_parse.c:52` when parsing PL/pgSQL code. The `strdup` function is used to allocate memory for `result.stderr_buffer` but it's not freed when parsing PL/pgSQL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak: The allocated memory for `result.stderr_buffer` is not released, leading to a memory leak.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Repeated parsing of PL/pgSQL code will lead to a gradual accumulation of memory, eventually causing the program to consume excessive memory. This could lead to performance degradation and potentially program termination or other unpredictable behavior if not handled correctly.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by parsing specially crafted PL/pgSQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to provide PL/pgSQL code to be parsed by the affected software.
