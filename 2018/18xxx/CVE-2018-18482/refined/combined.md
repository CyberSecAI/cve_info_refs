Hi, I compiled the 'parse\_plpgsql.c' and tested it with file "plpgsql\_samples.sql". ASan and valgrind find memory leak in pg\_query\_parse.c:52

```
==136926==ERROR: LeakSanitizer: detected memory leaks

Direct leak of 1 byte(s) in 1 object(s) allocated from:

```

After debugging by gdb, I found it seems 'result.stderr\_buffer' doesn't free correctly when parse plpgsql.(seems function pg\_query\_free\_parse\_result(pg\_query\_parse.c:116) doesn't be called.)
