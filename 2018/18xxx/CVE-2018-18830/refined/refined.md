The provided content is related to CVE-2018-18830.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of user authentication on the file upload interface (`FileAction.java`) in MCMS. This allows unauthenticated users to access and utilize the upload functionality. Additionally, there is a lack of whitelist validation on the uploaded file's extension.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unauthenticated file upload:** The upload interface does not require user login or authentication.
- **Lack of file extension validation:** The system does not perform proper checks against a whitelist of allowed file extensions. It relies on the client-provided filename, making it vulnerable to file extension manipulation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary file upload:** Attackers can upload malicious files, such as web shells, by manipulating the file extension in the "name" parameter of the upload request.
- **Remote code execution:** Successful upload of a web shell allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network-based:** Attackers can directly send malicious requests to the vulnerable upload endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **No authentication required:** Attackers do not need any credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network access:** Attackers need to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.
- **Web request manipulation:** Ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests, specifically the filename parameter.

**Technical Details:**
1. The vulnerable code is located in `MCMS-master\src\main\java\com\mingsoft\basic\action\web\FileAction.java`.
2. The system does not verify the user login status during file uploads.
3. The system uses the client-provided file name and concatenates it with current time to create a new filename, and then combines it with the `uploadPath` passed in from the client to store the file.
4. Attackers can upload a file with a harmless extension (e.g., image) and then intercept the request. By changing the file extension to a malicious one (e.g., `jsp`) within the `name` parameter, the server will store the file with the manipulated extension.
5. The server returns the storage path, which the attacker can then use to access the uploaded webshell.
