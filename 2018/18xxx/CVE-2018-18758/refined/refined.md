      "is_related": true,
      "technical_details": {
        "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input.",
        "vulnerability": "SQL injection exists in the `submit_feedback.php` script. The `batch_name` parameter, as well as `b_name`, `sem_name`, `division`, and `roll_no` parameters, are directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization.",
        "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information, modification of data, or even complete compromise of the database.",
        "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `submit_feedback.php` endpoint with malicious SQL code injected into the vulnerable parameters.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application. No authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability."
