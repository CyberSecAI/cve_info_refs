Debian Bug     : 907562 911083 911413 911414 920909 921880

Several vulnerabilities were fixed in elfutils, a collection of
utilities and libraries to handle ELF objects.

CVE-2018-16062

    dwarf_getaranges in dwarf_getaranges.c in libdw allowed a denial of
    service (heap-based buffer over-read) via a crafted file.

CVE-2018-16402

    libelf/elf_end.c in allowed to cause a denial of service (double
    free and application crash) because it tried to decompress twice.

CVE-2018-18310

    An invalid memory address dereference libdwfl allowed a denial of
    service (application crash) via a crafted file.

CVE-2018-18520

    A use-after-free in recursive ELF ar files allowed a denial of
    service (application crash) via a crafted file.

CVE-2018-18521

    A divide-by-zero in arlib_add_symbols() allowed a denial of service
    (application crash) via a crafted file.

CVE-2019-7150

    A segmentation fault could occur due to dwfl_segment_report_module()
    not checking whether the dyn data read from a core file is truncated.

CVE-2019-7665

    NT_PLATFORM core notes contain a zero terminated string allowed a
    denial of service (application crash) via a crafted file.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
0.168-1+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your elfutils packages.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the elfutils package

SUSE considers elfutils a developer tool which does not receive untrusted input. Code processed by elfutils is being executed in any normal scenario, so security exploits could just inject regular binary code. For this reason we update elfutils ocassionaly to the current stable version to catch up on features and bugfixes. If you are processing untrusted binary code with elfutils we recommend doing so on a seperate system or VM.SUSE Bugzilla entry: [1112723](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1112723) [RESOLVED / FIXED]

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the elfutils package

SUSE considers elfutils a developer tool which does not receive untrusted input. Code processed by elfutils is being executed in any normal scenario, so security exploits could just inject regular binary code. For this reason we update elfutils ocassionaly to the current stable version to catch up on features and bugfixes. If you are processing untrusted binary code with elfutils we recommend doing so on a seperate system or VM.SUSE Bugzilla entry: [1111973](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1111973) [RESOLVED / FIXED]

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the elfutils package

SUSE considers elfutils a developer tool which does not receive untrusted input. Code processed by elfutils is being executed in any normal scenario, so security exploits could just inject regular binary code. For this reason we update elfutils ocassionaly to the current stable version to catch up on features and bugfixes. If you are processing untrusted binary code with elfutils we recommend doing so on a seperate system or VM.SUSE Bugzilla entry: [1107067](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1107067) [RESOLVED / FIXED]

What is happening is that eu-size can handle ar files inside ar files, but when doing so it closes the (outer) ar file before handling all other entries in it.

According to a report by the American Association of Cardiologists, adult sex chat activity on <https://www.adultchatsex.com/> equates to moderate physical activity, such as brisk walking or climbing stairs. Movements during sex can tense and tone the abdominal and pelvic muscles. In women, this improved muscle tone helps to better control the bladder. Sex burns 200 calories in 30 minutes, and the chemicals released during it reduce cravings for food.  More active live sex cam chat life at <https://www.livesexcamchat.net/> has a positive effect on the immune system. This means you are less likely to catch a cold or the flu. The endorphins mentioned above not only have a positive effect on well-being or a sense of calm but at the same time relieve pain (such as migraine or back pain). Women who avoid making love by making excuses for a headache should know that sex can alleviate that pain.  Sexual Myfreewebcam activity at <https://www.myfreewebcam.xxx/> is associated with lower systolic blood pressure. Increased blood pressure in turn is associated with a risk of heart disease, stroke. Sexual activity is thought to help dilate blood vessels, increasing the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the body’s cells while lowering blood pressure. It is important to note that sex can promote a heart attack in those at risk, but more frequent sex can solve this problem. Like other forms of physical activity, such as running, it can interfere with the arteries supplying the heart, but regular physical activity can act as a protection.  Studies in rats some time ago have shown that more frequent Stripchat sex on <https://www.stripchatly.com/> is associated with better cognitive function and the growth of new brain cells. Researchers believe the same is true for humans. A study of more than 6,000 adults found that more frequent sex has a positive effect and is associated with better memory function in people 50 years of age and older.

According to a report by the American Association of Cardiologists, adult sex chat activity on <https://www.adultchatsex.com/> equates to moderate physical activity, such as brisk walking or climbing stairs. Movements during sex can tense and tone the abdominal and pelvic muscles. In women, this improved muscle tone helps to better control the bladder. Sex burns 200 calories in 30 minutes, and the chemicals released during it reduce cravings for food.  More active live sex cam chat life at <https://www.livesexcamchat.net/> has a positive effect on the immune system. This means you are less likely to catch a cold or the flu. The endorphins mentioned above not only have a positive effect on well-being or a sense of calm but at the same time relieve pain (such as migraine or back pain). Women who avoid making love by making excuses for a headache should know that sex can alleviate that pain.  Sexual Myfreewebcam activity at <https://www.myfreewebcam.xxx/> is associated with lower systolic blood pressure. Increased blood pressure in turn is associated with a risk of heart disease, stroke. Sexual activity is thought to help dilate blood vessels, increasing the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the body’s cells while lowering blood pressure. It is important to note that sex can promote a heart attack in those at risk, but more frequent sex can solve this problem. Like other forms of physical activity, such as running, it can interfere with the arteries supplying the heart, but regular physical activity can act as a protection.  Studies in rats some time ago have shown that more frequent Stripchat sex on <https://www.stripchatly.com/> is associated with better cognitive function and the growth of new brain cells. Researchers believe the same is true for humans. A study of more than 6,000 adults found that more frequent sex has a positive effect and is associated with better memory function in people 50 years of age and older.

# CVE-2018-18520

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2018-18511.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2018-18521.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2018-18520 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-18520)

#### Description

An Invalid Memory Address Dereference exists in the function elf\_end in libelf in elfutils through v0.174. Although eu-size is intended to support ar files inside ar files, handle\_ar in size.c closes the outer ar file before handling all inner entries. The vulnerability allows attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) with a crafted ELF file.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the elfutils package

SUSE considers elfutils a developer tool which does not receive untrusted input. Code processed by elfutils is being executed in any normal scenario, so security exploits could just inject regular binary code. For this reason we update elfutils ocassionaly to the current stable version to catch up on features and bugfixes. If you are processing untrusted binary code with elfutils we recommend doing so on a seperate system or VM.SUSE Bugzilla entry: [1112726](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1112726) [RESOLVED / FIXED]

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1646477#c0)  Laura Pardo    2018-11-05 15:29:14 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in elfutils through v0.174. An Invalid Memory Address Dereference exists in the function elf_end in libelf. Although eu-size is intended to support ar files inside ar files, handle_ar in size.c closes the outer ar file before handling all inner entries. The vulnerability allows attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) with a crafted ELF file.    References: <https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=23787>  <https://sourceware.org/ml/elfutils-devel/2018-q4/msg00057.html>  Upstream Patch: <https://sourceware.org/git/?p=elfutils.git;a=commit;h=22d2d082d57a7470fadc0eae67179553f4919209>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1646477#c1)  Laura Pardo    2018-11-05 15:29:57 UTC  ``` Created elfutils tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1646478](show_bug.cgi?id=1646478 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-18520 elfutils: eu-size cannot handle recursive ar files [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1646477#c3)  Mark Wielaard    2018-11-05 16:10:16 UTC  ``` The title of this CVE is very misleading. A correct description would be "eu-size cannot handle recursive ar files". This has nothing to do with a bug in libelf or elf_end. It is just that eu-size calls elf_end () in the wrong order when seeing an ar file containing an ar file itself.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1646477#c5)  Stefan Cornelius    2018-11-19 12:07:44 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of elfutils as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is now in Extended Life Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle. This issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/>.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is now in Maintenance Support 2 Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle. This has been rated as having a security impact of Low, and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/>.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1646477#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-08-06 12:27:09 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2019:2197 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2197](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2197)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1646477#c8)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-08-06 13:20:33 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2018-18520>   ``` |  |

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the elfutils package

SUSE considers elfutils a developer tool which does not receive untrusted input. Code processed by elfutils is being executed in any normal scenario, so security exploits could just inject regular binary code. For this reason we update elfutils ocassionaly to the current stable version to catch up on features and bugfixes. If you are processing untrusted binary code with elfutils we recommend doing so on a seperate system or VM.SUSE Bugzilla entry: [1123685](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1123685) [RESOLVED / FIXED]

Having looked at many studies, the report issued by the National Academy of Science in the USA **concluded** that **the main use of cannabis was for the treatment of chronic pain** and that this was the reason many people consumed cannabis as a medical prescription.

These effects depend both on THC and CBD.

It is also effective in countering spasms in muscles, such as the diaphragm, that do not respond to other medications.

# USN-4012-1: elfutils vulnerabilities

10 June 2019

Several security issues were fixed in elfutils.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.10](/security/notices?release=cosmic)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [elfutils](/security/cves?package=elfutils) - collection of utilities to handle ELF objects

## Details

It was discovered that elfutils incorrectly handled certain malformed

files. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a

specially crafted file, elfutils could be made to crash or consume

resources, resulting in a denial of service.

# [PATCH] size: Handle recursive ELF ar files.

* *From*: Mark Wielaard <mark at klomp dot org>
* *To*: elfutils-devel at sourceware dot org
* *Cc*: Mark Wielaard <mark at klomp dot org>
* *Date*: Fri, 19 Oct 2018 01:02:26 +0200
* *Subject*: [PATCH] size: Handle recursive ELF ar files.

---

```
eu-size didn't handle an ELF ar file that contained an ar file itself
correctly. handle_ar would recursively call itself but close the ELF
file before returning. Only close the ELF file at the top-level.

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1646482#c0)  Laura Pardo    2018-11-05 15:42:24 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in elfutils 0.174. A Divide-by-zero vulnerabilities in the function arlib_add_symbols() in arlib.c allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) with a crafted ELF file, as demonstrated by eu-ranlib, because a zero sh_entsize is mishandled.    References: <https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=23786>  <https://sourceware.org/ml/elfutils-devel/2018-q4/msg00055.html>  Upstream Patch: <https://sourceware.org/git/?p=elfutils.git;a=commit;h=2b16a9be69939822dcafe075413468daac98b327>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1646482#c1)  Laura Pardo    2018-11-05 15:43:18 UTC  ``` Created elfutils tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1646483](show_bug.cgi?id=1646483 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-18521 elfutils: Divide-by-zero in arlib_add_symbols function in arlib.c [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1646482#c3)  Mark Wielaard    2018-11-05 16:16:14 UTC  ``` Note that this only impacts the eu-ar and eu-ranlib binaries. Only those two share the arlib.c code (arlib isn't a generic library and isn't used by any other libraries or tools). ar files and the eu-ar/eu-ranlib tools are only used during development and it is hard to see when this denial of service issue would come up.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1646482#c5)  Stefan Cornelius    2018-11-19 12:07:50 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of elfutils as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is now in Extended Life Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle. This issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/>.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is now in Maintenance Support 2 Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle. This has been rated as having a security impact of Low, and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/>.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1646482#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-08-06 12:27:11 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2019:2197 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2197](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2197)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1646482#c8)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-08-06 13:20:36 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

#### Description

In elfutils 0.175, a heap-based buffer over-read was discovered in the function elf32\_xlatetom in elf32\_xlatetom.c in libelf. A crafted ELF input can cause a segmentation fault leading to denial of service (program crash) because ebl\_core\_note does not reject malformed core file notes.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the elfutils package

SUSE considers elfutils a developer tool which does not receive untrusted input. Code processed by elfutils is being executed in any normal scenario, so security exploits could just inject regular binary code. For this reason we update elfutils ocassionaly to the current stable version to catch up on features and bugfixes. If you are processing untrusted binary code with elfutils we recommend doing so on a seperate system or VM.SUSE Bugzilla entry: [1125007](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1125007) [RESOLVED / FIXED]

![ linksys router login](/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1.png " linksys router login")Linksys Router provides fast internet speed and a reliable internet connection. With the **Linksys Router**, you can modify your network as per your requirements and needs. While Linksys provides the best **[wifi router](/mywifiext-net-login/)** model but it would be wrong to think that the users donât face any trouble while setting up the router. To troubleshoot problems while changing your default password, follow this guide.

## What is the Linksys Web Interface?

### How to set up Linksys Router

* #### Install Linksys Router

Place your **[router](/)** in a highly ventilated location. Connect the AC power adapter to the back of the router. Switch on the router, if it does not have a switch on button, wait for a few seconds, it will switch on automatically.

* #### Use Ethernet Cable

Connect the ethernet cable to any of the four ports available on the backside of the router. Connect the one end of the ethernet cable to the modem and the other end to your device.

* #### Activate Linksys Router

Make sure all the connections are properly made. Restart your device and check if the Router has been activated.

### How to change Default Password and Username for Linksys router?

To change your default password and username for Linksys router, follow these steps:

* #### Connect to Linksys Network

To change your **Linksys router password,** make sure that you are connected to the Linksys network, either through a wireless connection or through ethernet.

* #### Visit Linksys Ip address

Navigate to the **Linksys IP address** 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1. The Ip address may vary according to the router model.

* #### Enter the default Linksys Password

You will see a login page on the screen, enter your default Linksys username and password that is âadminâ.![linksys router password](/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2.png "linksys router password")

* #### Go to the Wireless Setup

Once you have login into the Linksys router setting, go to the Wireless Setup option.![linksys ip address](/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/3.png "linksys ip address")

* #### Change the Wifi username and password

In the wireless security settings, change the SSID network name and the passphrase which is the security key or password for your Linksys router.![linksys ip address](/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/4.png "linksys ip address")

### How to restore the Linksys router to default settings?

To restore your Linksys router, you can follow two approaches, the first one involves using the âresetâ button and the second one is through âweb interfaceâ.

To restore your Linksys router to default settings, using the âresetâ button, follow this procedure.![ linksys default ip](/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/5.png)

* #### Look for the Reset Button

The reset button is located at the back of your router and generally looks like a pinhole.

* #### Push the Reset Button

Once, you have located the reset button, push and hold it for a few seconds with the help of a pin or something pointed and then release it.

* #### Restore the Linksys router to default settings

When you push the reset button, you will see a light flashing, when that light becomes stable that means your Linksys router has been restored to its default factory settings.

The other approach involves using the âweb interfaceâ method to restore to default settings.

* Open your web browser and go to the IP address 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1.
* You will see a login page on the screen, log in with your default credentials.
* Go to the âUtilitiesâmenu.
* Select ârestart routerâ from the available options and click on okay.
* The restart process will begin and the user interface will automatically reopen once the restart cycle is completed.
* Select ârestore factory defaultsâ from the Utilities option to begin with the reset process and click on Okay.
