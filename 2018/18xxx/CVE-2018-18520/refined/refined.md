Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-18520:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content from lists.debian.org and sourceware.org clearly identifies CVE-2018-18520 as a vulnerability related to elfutils, specifically mentioning the issue of "Bad handling of ar files inside ar files" that causes "Invalid Address Deference problem in function elf_end".  The Suse document also includes this CVE in its list of issues. This aligns with descriptions of CVE-2018-18520.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Recursive AR File Handling Issue**: The core issue lies in how `eu-size` processes nested archive (`.ar`) files, which are a type of file format used by `elfutils`. When an archive file contains another archive file inside it, the `handle_ar` function in `size.c` recursively calls itself to process the inner archive. However, the function was incorrectly closing the file handle of the *outer* archive before it completed processing *all* entries in that outer archive. This premature closure leads to a use-after-free condition.
*   **Incorrect elf_end() Call**:  The vulnerability is triggered because  `elf_end` was being called prematurely before fully processing all entries in a nested archive.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Free**:  The main vulnerability is a use-after-free. The file handle for the outer AR file is closed too early and subsequent operations attempt to use this closed handle.
*   **Invalid Memory Access**: The use-after-free results in attempts to dereference invalid memory addresses, leading to a crash.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS)**: The primary impact is a denial-of-service, leading to a crash. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to crash applications that uses `eu-size` with crafted input files.
*   **Application Crash**:  The vulnerability leads to an application crash as a result of the memory access violation, making the affected application unusable.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted ELF AR Files**:  The attack vector is through maliciously crafted ELF archive files (.ar files) that include nested ar files. An attacker would create an archive file that includes another one, triggering the vulnerable code path in eu-size.
*   **File Processing**: The vulnerability is triggered when a tool that relies on elfutils (such as eu-size) attempts to process the crafted ar file.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Crafted File Creation:** An attacker needs to create an ELF ar file that contains another ar file.
*   **File Delivery:** The attacker must deliver this crafted file to a system running a vulnerable version of elfutils, specifically using `eu-size`.
*   **User Interaction:** The vulnerability requires a user to attempt to process the crafted file using the affected elfutils binaries such as `eu-size`, for example by running `eu-size <crafted_file>`.
*   **No Special Privileges:** No special privileges are required for the attacker to exploit this.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   **Misleading CVE Description**:  The sourceware.org bug report notes that the official CVE description is misleading. The vulnerability isn't directly within the `elf_end()` function in the `libelf` library, but in how the `eu-size` tool manages recursive archive files.
*   **Affected Tools:** The vulnerability specifically affects the `eu-size`, `eu-ar` and `eu-ranlib` tools within the elfutils package, because they make use of the vulnerable `handle_ar` function in `size.c`.
*   **Upstream fix**: The identified fix was to only close the ELF file handle at the top level call in `handle_ar` and not when recursively called to handle nested archives.

**Summary of Vulnerability:**

CVE-2018-18520 describes a use-after-free vulnerability in the `eu-size` tool of the elfutils package. This occurs when processing recursively nested archive files (`.ar` files) due to a premature closure of the outer ar file handle by function `handle_ar` before all the entries within it were processed, leading to a potential crash.
