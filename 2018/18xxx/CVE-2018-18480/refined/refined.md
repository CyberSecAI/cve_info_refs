The provided content is related to CVE-2018-18480. It describes a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability found in the `libopencad` library.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient bounds checking when reading data from a DWG file. Specifically, the issues are located in `io.cpp` at line 331 (`ReadCHAR`) and line 444 (`ReadMCHAR`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: Reading beyond allocated memory on the heap.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Application crash: The AddressSanitizer reports a crash due to memory corruption.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution: While not explicitly stated, heap-buffer-overflows can sometimes be leveraged for more serious attacks depending on the memory layout and specific circumstances.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious DWG file: The vulnerability is triggered when processing specially crafted DWG files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a malicious DWG file to be opened by a vulnerable application using libopencad.
- No specific privileges are mentioned other than the ability to open and process files.

**Additional Details:**
The provided issue report includes AddressSanitizer output, which pinpoints the exact line of code and the type of memory corruption, along with the allocation call stack. Two separate crashes are shown using different proof-of-concept files (`poc1.dwg` and `poc2.dwg`).
