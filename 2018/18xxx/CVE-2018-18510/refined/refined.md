Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-18510:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `about:crashcontent` and `about:crashparent` internal pages, intended for testing purposes, could be triggered by web content. This was possible because there were no restrictions preventing these pages from being loaded as a resource via HTML elements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unrestricted access to internal debugging pages:** The `about:crashcontent` and `about:crashparent` pages were designed for internal use to crash the browser or the current tab for testing, but were accessible via web content.
- **Lack of security checks:** The browser did not properly check the context or origin of requests to these pages, allowing web content to initiate the crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Non-persistent Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious website or an attacker-controlled iframe could cause a denial of service by loading the `about:crashcontent` page to crash a specific tab, or the `about:crashparent` page to crash the entire browser.
- **Limited impact:** The vulnerability only caused a crash, it did not provide a way to execute code or disclose sensitive information. It was classified as a low severity vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web content (HTML):** The vulnerability could be triggered through various HTML elements like `<img>`, `<link rel="icon">`, `<iframe>` or `<video>`. These elements would reference `about:crashcontent` or `about:crashparent` in their `src` or `href` attributes, leading to the crash.
- **Data URI:** Malicious web content could use data URIs to embed the `about:` URLs, e.g. `data:text/html,<link rel="icon" href="about:crashparent"/>`
- **Links** A link to `about:crashparent` could crash the browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote access:** Attackers only need to be able to host or inject malicious HTML.
- **Limited skill:** Exploiting this vulnerability did not require advanced technical knowledge.
- **No user interaction:** The DoS could occur without any user interaction aside from the user visiting the malicious page.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability was initially reported by Hanno BÃ¶ck.
- The fix involved restricting access to these `about:` pages to only top-level document loads.
- The fix was implemented in Firefox 64 and later versions.
- This issue was not initially included in the security advisory for Firefox 64 but was added later and assigned CVE-2018-18510.
- The vulnerability was classified as `sec-low`, indicating a low security impact.
