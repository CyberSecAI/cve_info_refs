The firefox special URL "about:crashcontent" will trigger a crash of the current tab for testing purposes.
It is possible to trigger that URL from within a webpage, e.g. via an <img> tag. This also extends to being able to crash a browser from within an iframe, which I believe is particularly problematic as iframes are often used to embed content that a site not necessarily trusts.
(For a practical example look at <https://twitter.com/xsamaster/status/1063347833271713792> - a tweet that embeds a "video" that will crash the browser tab.)
I believe a special debugging feature URL like about:crashcontent should never be accessible from a webpage, it should only be possible to activate it if the user actually types in that URL.

Wow, thank you for reporting this. It gets even worse, you can crash the entire browser with data:text/html,<link rel="icon" href="about:crashparent"/>, so that means any web content can trivially trigger it.
Combined with other issues (e.g. gaming frecency to become a top site) this can be catastrophic.
Snorp, we should not have about:crashparent in the first place. I remember a proposal for having an about:restart page being denied in an email discussion based on the effort we would have to go through to avoid loopholes that cause web content to load it. Even if we fix this issue IMO the risk is too high to keep it.
I'm less sure about about:crashcontent, though my vote would be for removing it as well.
Considering that this is a tweet already, we might need to act fast before someone discovers about:crashparent...

I'm deleting the tweet + the loaded code for now. (I didn't think a lot about creating this, this is a test account from me, I doubt anyone knows about it publicly.)
I'd also like to voice my opinion that I absolutely think this is a useful feature and should \*not\* be removed. I wish I knew about it, then I could've found #1507142 sooner. However I think it might be an idea to put it behind a flag that comes with a warning that this should only be used for debugging.

At a minimum, this should have been nightly/testing-only, maybe mobile-only if that's what it's for, and it should have been tested thoroughly to make sure web content couldn't trip it in any way. I'm not sure if just removing URI\_SAFE\_FOR\_UNTRUSTED\_CONTENT is enough here, given the way the implementation is done (ie in NewChannel, rather than when the content of the URI actually loads).Flags: needinfo?(ehsan)

I agree that web content shouldn't be able to trigger this, but I disagree about this being e.g. mobile-only. this feature is required to test automation across different platforms.
If possible, we should make it such that it cannot be loaded as a resource and not redirected to. But I don't know if that is easily doable.

If we need it just for testing automation, can we make it only available when MOZ\_AUTOMATION / Cu.isInAutomation is true?Flags: needinfo?(choller)

Fundamentally this is also a replacement for the "Crash me now" extension that stopped working when we dropped support for non-web extensions. Being able to test our crash reporting pipeline is pretty important. If we disable these URLs then we should figure out a path to support something like that extension again. rhelmer had a prototype web extension + experiment but we had a hard time getting people on board with shipping it: <https://github.com/rhelmer/webext-experiment-crashme/>

Yes, I believe going for this and/or a set of prefs is the right approach. Johann also proposed this. In Fuzzing, I don't think we have Cu.isInAutomation set, but we do have a fuzzing pref and FUZZING builds. So it is certainly possible to tie this to some pref/env variables.Flags: needinfo?(choller)

Well, we can probably/hopefully enforce that the channel is a toplevel document load as well... belt and suspenders and all that.

Ugh, what a mess. I would prefer a solution that doesn't require prefs, if doable. GeckoView consumers don't have a direct way of setting prefs and they also want to be able to test crash reporting since there is some downstream stuff that they need to implement.
My preference is to restrict this to toplevel, user-entered loads if possible. It looks like we should be able to ensure it's a toplevel load by checking `nsILoadInfo::loadingDocument` in `nsAboutRedirector::NewChannel`, but I'm not sure about the user-entered part. I thought we had some flags for that, but I guess they're not present in nsILoadInfo? The comments in nsAboutModule.idl indicate you need MAKE\_LINKABLE to allow links from content, so maybe checking for toplevel is enough?Flags: needinfo?(snorp)

Unlikely we'll fix this in 63 at this point, but we should definitely do something for 64+.

Can those consumers not set the right env vars to trip Cu.isInAutomation? Otherwise, could geckoview expose an API that consumers can call to toggle this functionality on/off? (ni for this)

You can check for triggering principal == system principal, I guess, but I'm not aware of us having anything that \*actually\* means user-entered.

I don't think that alone is enough, given that this exploit uses <iframe> or <video> or <img> sourcing. From just checking a data:text/html,<img src=about:crashcontent>, apparently we first create the channel and then do security checks on that channel (from inside AsyncOpen). In which case, the implementation of the crash may need to move out of NewChannel so the crash only happens \*after\* the security checks instead of \*before\*.

I don't see that anyone has mentioned it yet but for the record--these are safe crashes that are not exploitable. This is simply a DoS vector.

We could, but it's a PITA. It's just that much more work that every app needs to duplicate. If it comes to this, fine, but avoiding would be preferable.

The patch + test seems to be working for these cases, but I could be missing something there. I would definitely appreciate an expert opinion.

Right, so currently whenever we create a new Channel the NewChannel() implementation, for this case in particular [1] is run before we open the channel. In other words, no security have been performed at that point. I think it makes sense to move that code [1] somewhere else. A common point would be the ContentSecurityManager after all the security checks have performed, somewhere at the end of DoContentSecurityChecks().
Alternatively, probably better, we could move it to the right ::asyncOpen2() implementation and put it there after the security checks have been performed. I think about channels call nsBaseChannel::AsyncOpen2() [2].
Additionally, as Gijs suggested, I think it makes sense to not ship that code in release. We should use |#ifdef debug| or something similar.

Oh, one last note that might be of importance. Do we want to allow that crash to be triggered by web content? E.g. for testing purposes? The right way to figure that out is by inspecting the TriggeringPrincipal within the LoadInfo. Calling |triggeringPrincipal->GetIsCodebasePrincipal()| would reveal that information if needed.

The <img src="about:crashcontent"> no longer works, but the example from [comment #1](/show_bug.cgi?id=1507702#c1 "VERIFIED FIXED - \"about:crashcontent\" and \"about:crashparent\" can be triggered from web content") - <link rel="icon" href="about:crashparent"/> - still crashes nightly.

Accessing "about:crashcontent" in the latest Firefox Nightly and Firefox beta displays "Gah. Your tab just crashed." with the options to "Close Tab" or "Restore This tab" without closing Firefox.
But accessing "about:crashparent" crashes Firefox and close Firefox.

Accessing these URIs via the location bar should do as you described. This patch prevents web content from loading them (as resources, etc).Flags: needinfo?(snorp)

> This wasn't mentioned in the security advisory for Firefox 64:

That's a better question addressed to security@ mail, not buried in this bug which the people writing advisories obviously somehow missed (which is probably why it didn't have an advisory in the first place). RC2 of a release ([comment 29](/show_bug.cgi?id=1507702#c29 "VERIFIED FIXED - \"about:crashcontent\" and \"about:crashparent\" can be triggered from web content")) is typically after we've done the advisories and no one let us know.

New about: pages, especially web-accessible ones, really ought to have had a security review.

The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo

It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.11; rv:61.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/61.0
Steps to reproduce:
This is the same issue as [bug#1495011](/show_bug.cgi?id=1495011 "RESOLVED FIXED - Unsafe use of CheckedInt (possible buffer overflow) in ScriptLoader::ConvertToUTF16").
nsresult
nsContentUtils::CalculateBufferSizeForImage(const uint32\_t& aStride,
const IntSize& aImageSize,
const SurfaceFormat& aFormat,
size\_t\* aMaxBufferSize,
size\_t\* aUsedBufferSize)
{
CheckedInt32 requiredBytes =
CheckedInt32(aStride) \* CheckedInt32(aImageSize.height);
if (!requiredBytes.isValid()) {
return NS\_ERROR\_FAILURE;
}
\*aMaxBufferSize = requiredBytes.value();
\*aUsedBufferSize = \*aMaxBufferSize - aStride + (aImageSize.width \* BytesPerPixel(aFormat));
return NS\_OK;
}
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/base/nsContentUtils.cpp#7863>
requiredBytes is checked for an overflow, however a couple of lines later its raw unchecked value is used in arithmetic calculations again. Thus aUsedBufferSize can potentially overflow on x86 systems.

Looks like this was introduced in [bug 1473161](/show_bug.cgi?id=1473161 "RESOLVED FIXED - Missing bounds checks in nsContentUtils::DataTransferItemToImage") which was also a sec bug and backported to esr60. Nika, you reviewed, can you take a look or pass this onto someone else who can?Blocks: [1473161](/show_bug.cgi?id=1473161 "RESOLVED FIXED - Missing bounds checks in nsContentUtils::DataTransferItemToImage")Flags: needinfo?(nika)

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
