    {
      "source": "numanozdemir.com_973e26db_20250125_193643.html",
      "root_cause": "Insufficient input sanitization in various VestaCP functionalities allows for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a VestaCP user's browser session. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Stored XSS via uploaded file names.",
        "Reflected XSS via URL parameters in the following paths: `/edit/web/`, `/list/backup/`, `/list/rrd/`, and `/list/directory/`"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to upload a file with an XSS payload as its name or craft a URL with the XSS payload in the parameters.",
      "details": "The vulnerability is present in VestaCP versions up to v0.9.8-22. The provided examples showcase stored XSS via file names, and reflected XSS via multiple URL parameters. The reflected XSS examples use the `<img>` tag with an `onerror` event to trigger the `alert(1337)` function. The paths `/edit/web/`, `/list/backup/`, `/list/rrd/`, and `/list/directory/` are specifically vulnerable."
