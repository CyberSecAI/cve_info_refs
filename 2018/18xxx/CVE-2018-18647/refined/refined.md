**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application lacks authorization checks when deleting merge and push access level objects for protected branches, allowing unauthorized users to remove these access levels.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The primary weakness is the absence of authorization checks in the `destroy` action of the `Projects::ProtectedBranches::MergeAccessLevelsController`, `Projects::ProtectedBranches::PushAccessLevelsController`, and `Projects::ProtectedTags::CreateAccessLevelsController`. This allows any user, including unauthenticated users for public projects, to delete access levels.
- **Direct Object Reference:** The vulnerability relies on directly referencing the IDs of protected branches and access level objects in the request, which can be easily enumerated due to their auto-incremental nature.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** By deleting merge and push access levels, attackers can prevent authorized users from pushing commits or merging merge requests to protected branches, effectively causing a denial of service.
- **Loss of Branch Protection:** The removal of access levels undermines the security and control provided by protected branches, leading to potential data corruption or unauthorized code changes.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP DELETE Request:** The attack vector is sending a crafted HTTP DELETE request to specific endpoints containing the IDs of the protected branch and the access level object that needs to be deleted.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the GitLab instance.
- **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know the URL format, the IDs of the project, protected branch and access level objects, which are easily guessable due to being auto-incremented, but can also be found in the application through normal usage.
- **User Account (Optional):** Authentication is not required for public projects, but an authenticated user account can also be used.
