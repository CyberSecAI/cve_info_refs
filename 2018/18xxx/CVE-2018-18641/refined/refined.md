- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Personal Access Tokens (PATs) are stored in plain text in the PostgreSQL database.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Storage of sensitive credentials (PATs) in plain text.
    - Vulnerability to SQL injection attacks and database leaks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exposure of personal access tokens, leading to potential unauthorized access to GitLab resources.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - SQL injection attacks
    - Database leaks
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Access to the GitLab database (e.g., through a successful SQL injection attack or a database breach)
