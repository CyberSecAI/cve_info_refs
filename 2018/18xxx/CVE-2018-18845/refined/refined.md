- The XSS payload is injected through URL parameters/path of `index.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs no authentication, being able to be remote.
- The attacker only needs to create and deliver a malicious URL to the victim.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable software is Advanced Comment System v1.0, which is discontinued.
- The vulnerability was found in the file `internal/advanced_comment_system/index.php`.
