The provided content describes a stored XSS vulnerability in yunucms 1.1.5.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when editing a category, leading to the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML into the application. When other users access the affected part of the application, the malicious scripts execute in their browsers. This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered via the admin panel, specifically when editing a category. The attacker injects the malicious code into a form field that is then stored in the database.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have administrative access to the yunucms application to inject the malicious script through the category editing form.
