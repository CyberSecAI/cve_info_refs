- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Xen Mobile service listening on port 5001 deserializes untrusted Java objects without authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unsafe deserialization of Java objects from untrusted sources. The `readObject` method of the `DiskFileItem` class from `commons-fileupload-1.3.1.jar` is used to write a file to an arbitrary location.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution. An attacker can control the code and data that are deserialized and executed, enabling them to upload and execute malicious code by writing a JSP file to the Tomcat web directory.
- **Attack vectors:** Network adjacent unauthenticated users can send crafted serialized Java objects to the vulnerable service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be network adjacent to the vulnerable service to send the malicious serialized objects. While a firewall is in place, this vulnerability could be exploited if another vulnerability allows the attacker to bypass the firewall.
