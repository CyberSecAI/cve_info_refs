## Description

[![@jburger](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/579657?u=b650cce566ccc40195e5e403de789be1b7c15afa&v=4&size=48)](/jburger)[jburger](https://github.com/jburger)opened [on Oct 30, 2018](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Issues/issues/5042#issue-375723532)
## Description

An authenticated user with permission to modify deployment processes could upload a maliciously crafted YAML configuration, potentially allowing for remote execution of arbitrary code, running in the same context as the Octopus Server (for self-hosted installations by default, SYSTEM).

If this issue is of concern to you and your team, we strongly recommend upgrading to version `2018.9.1`.

[CVE-2018-18850](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-483m-372f-vxc5 "CVE-2018-18850")

## Affected versions

**Octopus Server:**

versions 2018.8.0-2018.9.0, inclusive.

## Mitigation

In any version affected by this issue, we recommend upgrading to version `2018.9.1`.

## Workarounds

In situations where upgrade is not possible, running the octopus server built in worker as a service account with limited privileges may help to minimize the potential impact of such an occurrence, however this will not prevent attackers from attempting to chain other attacks against the server.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
