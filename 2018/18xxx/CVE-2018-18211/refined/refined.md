{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in the `api.php` file, specifically within the `addform` function. User-supplied data, particularly in the `contacts[content]` parameter, is not properly validated, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL injection vulnerability. Improper handling of user input allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL queries into the database.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to extract sensitive data from the database. In this case, the attacker is able to retrieve the admin's username and password. This could lead to complete compromise of the affected web application.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted POST request to the `/api.php/cms/addform` endpoint with the `fcode=1` parameter set. The malicious SQL injection is placed in the `contacts[content]` POST parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the affected application, which can be achieved from a remote position. Additionally, the attacker must know that the API functionality is enabled in the background to exploit this vulnerability. No prior authentication is required to exploit the SQL injection."
