Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerabilities in DuomiCms 3.0:

**1. XXE Vulnerability**
*   **Root Cause:** The application uses `simplexml_load_file` to parse XML data from `data/admin/playerKinds.xml`. This file's content is controllable by an attacker.
*   **Weakness:** The `playerKinds.xml` file can be modified by submitting malicious XML payloads via `admin/admin_player.php`, specifically when `$action=="addnew"`. While the parameters are HTML encoded, the structure of the xml file and its parsing is the issue, not the encoding.
*   **Impact:**  An attacker can perform an XXE attack to read local files, perform SSRF, or potentially cause a denial of service.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker needs access to the admin panel to add a new player, which results in the modification of the `playerKinds.xml` file
*   **Required Capabilities:** Admin access.

**2. Front-end Code Execution**
*   **Root Cause:** Unsanitized user input is used to construct a string that is later executed using `eval()`.
*   **Weakness:** The application parses template tags, specifically within `parseIf` and `parseSubIf` functions, in `duomiphp/core.class.php` where user controlled data is concatenated and passed to `eval`. Input filtering is present but insufficient to prevent code injection.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.
*   **Attack Vector:** By injecting code within the `searchword` parameter of `search.php`. The `searchword` parameter has a 20 character limit.
*   **Required Capabilities:**  None. The vulnerability is accessible to unauthenticated users.

**3. SQL Injection Vulnerability**
*   **Root Cause:** The application uses unsanitized user input from the `uid` parameter in `duomiphp/ajax.php`, which is directly concatenated into SQL queries.
*   **Weakness:**  The `$uid` variable is directly embedded in a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization, and can be controlled through a GET request.  While there are some filters, the filtering process uses a modified version of the query for sanitization checks, and the original unsanitized version is used for query execution.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, allowing data exfiltration, modification, or deletion and potential database takeover.
*   **Attack Vector:**  The attacker injects malicious SQL code through the `uid` parameter in requests to `duomiphp/ajax.php`. The vulnerable endpoint is the `addfav` action, which is accessible without authentication
*  **Required Capabilities:**  None. The vulnerability is accessible to unauthenticated users.

**Summary of Findings**
The provided content details three distinct vulnerabilities within DuomiCms 3.0. These vulnerabilities include an XXE vulnerability, front-end code execution, and SQL injection, all stemming from insufficient input sanitization and direct use of user-provided data in sensitive operations.

The most severe of these are the code execution and SQL injection vulnerabilities, as they provide the attacker with the capability to fully compromise the host.
