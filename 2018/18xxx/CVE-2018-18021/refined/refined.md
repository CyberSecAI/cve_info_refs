Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-18021:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) subsystem specifically on ARM64 architectures. The KVM implementation did not properly handle some `ioctl` calls, particularly `KVM_SET_ON_REG`, when setting the processor state (PSTATE).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The KVM subsystem lacks proper checks on user-supplied register values. Specifically, it allows setting invalid execution modes (PSTATE.M), leading to hypervisor crashes.
*   **Lack of Hardware Capability Awareness:** It fails to verify that user-provided values are compatible with both the VM settings and the actual hardware capabilities, allowing for out-of-bounds memory access or memory corruption.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The issue can be exploited by directing hypervisor execution flow with full register control, bypassing the intended return to the guest VM. This can be leveraged for privilege escalation.
*   **Denial of Service:** By triggering an illegal exception return, it can cause a hypervisor panic, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) of the host system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with the ability to create KVM-based VMs can gain control of the hypervisor.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can redirect the hypervisor's flow of control with full register control, potentially executing arbitrary code in the host environment.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause the hypervisor to panic, crashing the host system.
*   **Information Exposure:** Some documents mention the possibility of information leaks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
*   **KVM VM Creation Privilege:** The attacker needs permission to create KVM-based virtual machines on the affected ARM64 system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have an account on the system with the ability to create KVM-based virtual machines.
*   No other specific capabilities or prior access to hypervisor or kernel is needed.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to ARM64 architectures.
*   The issue was addressed by upstream commits that tightened guest core register access from userspace and sanitized the PSTATE.M register.
*   Various Linux distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, and Red Hat) have issued security advisories and updates to address this issue.
*   The fixes involve sanitizing the PSTATE.M register and tightening guest core register access.
*   The provided data contains more detailed technical analysis and fixes of the vulnerability than the basic CVE description, which is just a placeholder.

**Summary:**

CVE-2018-18021 describes a critical vulnerability in the KVM subsystem of Linux kernels running on ARM64 architectures. By exploiting inadequate input sanitization and lack of hardware awareness within the `KVM_SET_ON_REG` `ioctl`, a local attacker with KVM VM creation privileges can achieve hypervisor control, leading to either privilege escalation, arbitrary code execution, or a denial of service on the host system. The vulnerability requires a fix at the kernel level.
