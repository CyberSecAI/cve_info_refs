{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Ticketly 1.0 application is vulnerable to SQL Injection due to insufficient input sanitization in multiple parameters within various resources, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code into database queries.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can read, modify, or delete information from the database, execute commands on the operating system, cause a denial of service, obtain confidential information, escalate privileges, or render the application inoperable.",
    "attack_vectors": {
      "location": "The vulnerability can be exploited via POST requests to the following resources:",
      "endpoints": [
        "/action/addproject.php",
        "/action/addticket.php",
         "/reports.php"

    },
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoints. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerabilities.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerable parameters allow the use of WHERE, HAVING, ORDER BY, and GROUP BY conditions, which allows for the extraction of significant amounts of data with a single query. The vulnerability can be exploited using boolean-based blind, error-based, and time-based blind SQL injection techniques. Successful exploitation can lead to critical impacts on the application and its underlying system."
