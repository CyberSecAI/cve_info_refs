Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-18438:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Integer overflow in the `ccid_card_vscard_read()` function within the CCID Passthru card device emulation.
- The function receives a signed integer 'size' argument, which is later used as an unsigned `size_t` value in `memcpy()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Integer Overflow:** The signed integer 'size' can be negative, and when cast to an unsigned `size_t`, it becomes a very large positive number due to the nature of two's complement representation.
- **Uncontrolled Memory Copy:** The `memcpy` operation will then attempt to copy an extremely large chunk of memory from the provided buffer leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A guest user can trigger the integer overflow leading to an out-of-bounds `memcpy` operation. This results in QEMU process crashing.
- **Memory Corruption:** The `memcpy` with an extremely large size can lead to memory corruption and potentially other unspecified issues.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious guest user can exploit this vulnerability via the CCID passthrough device by providing a negative size value, triggering the overflow.
- The vulnerability exists in the `ccid_card_vscard_read()` function of the CCID Passthru card device emulation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be a user inside the guest OS.
- The attacker must have access to the CCID passthrough device interface.
- The attacker needs to send a crafted request with a negative size value.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided patches modify the `IOReadHandler` to use an unsigned `size_t` type, which is part of the fix by converting other char devices to unsigned types, specifically addressing the root cause of the issue. This includes changing the `ccid_card_vscard_read()` to use `size_t`.
- The vulnerability was reported by Arash Tohidi.
