This document provides details of multiple vulnerabilities found in xpdf version 4.00. It includes crash information, source code locations, and ASAN reports. The specific vulnerabilities listed in the document are:

**1. `DCTStream::readScan@Stream.cc-3051___out-of-bounds-read`**
   - **Root Cause:** Out-of-bounds read in the `DCTStream::readScan` function.
   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  The code reads data from `frameBuf` using calculated indices (`y1+y2` and `x1+x2`) without proper bounds checking, potentially reading outside of allocated memory.
   - **Impact of Exploitation:**  Results in a crash due to a segmentation fault (SEGV) caused by reading from an invalid memory location.
   - **Attack Vectors:**  Crafted PDF file with a malformed image data triggers the vulnerability when processed using pdftoppm.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Attacker needs to provide a specially crafted PDF file. The user must then process this file using the vulnerable `pdftoppm` tool.

**2. `CCITTFaxStream::readRow@Stream.cc-1822___heap-buffer-overflow`**
   - **Root Cause:** Heap-buffer-overflow in the `CCITTFaxStream::readRow` function.
    - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The code attempts to read past the allocated buffer of the `CCITTFaxStream`, leading to a heap-buffer-overflow.
   - **Impact of Exploitation:** Results in a crash due to a heap-buffer-overflow when processing a malformed CCITTFax stream.
   - **Attack Vectors:** Crafted PDF file with a malformed CCITTFax stream triggers the vulnerability when processed using `pdftoppm`.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Attacker needs to provide a specially crafted PDF file. The user must then process this file using the vulnerable `pdftoppm` tool.

**3. `Object::isName@Object.h-134___stack-buffer-overflow`**
   - **Root Cause:** Stack-buffer-overflow in the `Object::isName` function.
   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The code reads beyond allocated stack memory when calling `isName`, leading to a stack-buffer-overflow.
   - **Impact of Exploitation:** Results in a crash due to a stack-buffer-overflow when processing a malformed PDF file.
   - **Attack Vectors:** Crafted PDF file with a malformed name object triggers the vulnerability when processed using `pdftoppm`.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Attacker needs to provide a specially crafted PDF file. The user must then process this file using the vulnerable `pdftoppm` tool.

**4. `DCTStream::getBlock@Stream.cc-2812___out-of-bounds-read`**
   - **Root Cause:** Out-of-bounds read in the `DCTStream::getBlock` function.
   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The code accesses `frameBuf` with calculated indices without checking bounds, leading to an out-of-bounds read.
   - **Impact of Exploitation:** Results in a crash due to a segmentation fault (SEGV) when processing a malformed DCT stream.
   - **Attack Vectors:**  Crafted PDF file containing malformed DCT data triggers the vulnerability when processed using `pdftoppm`.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Attacker needs to provide a specially crafted PDF file. The user must then process this file using the vulnerable `pdftoppm` tool.

**5. `DCTStream::readHuffSym@Stream.cc-3662___heap-buffer-overflow`**
   - **Root Cause:** Heap-buffer-overflow in the `DCTStream::readHuffSym` function.
   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Reading out of bounds on a heap allocated buffer while processing a malformed huffman table in a DCT stream.
   - **Impact of Exploitation:** Results in a crash due to a heap-buffer-overflow when processing a malformed DCT stream.
    - **Attack Vectors:** Crafted PDF file with malformed huffman data in DCT stream triggers the vulnerability when processed using `pdftoppm`.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Attacker needs to provide a specially crafted PDF file. The user must then process this file using the vulnerable `pdftoppm` tool.

**6. `DCTStream::decodeImage@Stream.cc-3325___out-of-bounds-read`**
  -   **Root Cause:** Out-of-bounds read in the `DCTStream::decodeImage` function.
    -   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Similar to other DCT stream vulnerabilities, out-of-bounds reads happen due to unchecked indices into the `frameBuf` array.
    -   **Impact of Exploitation:** Results in a crash due to a segmentation fault (SEGV) when processing a malformed DCT stream.
    -   **Attack Vectors:** Crafted PDF file with malformed image data within DCT stream triggers the vulnerability when processed using `pdftoppm`.
    -   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Attacker needs to provide a specially crafted PDF file. The user must then process this file using the vulnerable `pdftoppm` tool.

**7. `GfxImageColorMap::GfxImageColorMap@GfxState.cc-3550___heap-buffer-overflow`**
    -   **Root Cause:** Heap-buffer-overflow in the `GfxImageColorMap` constructor.
    -   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Out-of-bounds read when processing an Indexed color space.
    -   **Impact of Exploitation:** Results in a crash due to heap-buffer-overflow when processing the crafted PDF file.
    -   **Attack Vectors:** Crafted PDF file containing a malformed Indexed color space triggers the vulnerability when processed using `pdftoppm`.
    -   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Attacker needs to provide a specially crafted PDF file. The user must then process this file using the vulnerable `pdftoppm` tool.

The common theme among all these vulnerabilities is that they are triggered by processing specially crafted PDF files, typically with malformed or corrupted data within streams or objects, leading to out-of-bounds reads or writes, ultimately causing crashes.
