Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-18941:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the exposure of the administrator password within the HTML source code of a specific page within the Vignette Content Management system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the administrator's password (displayed as asterisks) within the HTML source of the `/vgn/ccb/user/mgmt/user/edit/0,1628,0,00.html?uid=admin` page. This allows an attacker to obtain the password.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization**: It appears that the password field is not sanitized or protected correctly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker who discovers the administrator's password can use it to authenticate as an administrator.
- **Complete System Compromise:** With administrative access, an attacker can create privileged user accounts, modify CMS features, and potentially gain full control over the Vignette Content Management system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Request to Vulnerable Page:** The attacker accesses the vulnerable page: `/vgn/ccb/user/mgmt/user/edit/0,1628,0,00.html?uid=admin`.
- **Web Browser**: Attackers can use any web browser to access the page and view the source code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the Vignette Content Management system through the network.
- **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to navigate to the vulnerable URL, view the HTML source code of a web page.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered in 2005 but reported later in 2018, suggesting it was a long-standing issue.
- The affected product, Vignette Content Management version 6, is discontinued. The suggested solution is to upgrade to the latest version of the product.
