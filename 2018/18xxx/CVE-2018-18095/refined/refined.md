Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-18095:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Improper authentication in the firmware of specific Intel SSDs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Lack of proper authentication mechanisms in the firmware, allowing unauthorized actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Escalation of privilege, allowing an unprivileged user to gain higher access levels.
*   Potential for unauthorized modification of the SSD's behavior or data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Physical access to the vulnerable SSDs is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs physical access to the system containing the affected Intel SSD.
*   The attacker doesn't need to have any prior privileges on the system, as they are exploiting the vulnerability from an unprivileged state.

**Affected Products:**
*   Intel® SSD DC S4500 Series with firmware versions prior to SCV10150.
*   Intel® SSD DC S4600 Series with firmware versions prior to SCV10150.

**Mitigation:**
*   Update the firmware of the affected SSDs to version SCV10150 or later.

**Additional Notes:**
* The CVSS score is 5.3 Medium, with vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N. This indicates that the attack requires physical access (P), is low complexity (L), no privileges are required (N), no user interaction is needed (N), scope is changed(C), no confidentiality impact (N), high integrity impact (H), and no availability impact (N).
*   The vulnerability was internally discovered by Intel.
*   Intel follows a Coordinated Disclosure practice, releasing information after mitigations are available.
