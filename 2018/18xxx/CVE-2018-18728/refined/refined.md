Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the Tenda router's web server (httpd), specifically in how it handles the `usbName` parameter within a POST request. The value of the `usbName` parameter is directly passed to the `doSystem` function without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** The primary vulnerability is that the lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the `doSystem` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the router's operating system. This can lead to a variety of malicious outcomes:
    *   Complete control over the router.
    *   Data exfiltration.
    *   Malware installation.
    *   Denial of service.
    *   Network manipulation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a specifically crafted HTTP POST request to the router's web server.
*   **`usbName` Parameter:** The malicious payload is injected through the `usbName` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the router's web interface. This could be via the local network or, if the web interface is exposed, from the internet.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know the specific parameter (`usbName`) to exploit this vulnerability and also the vulnerable URL to send the request.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability affects Tenda AC9, AC15, and AC18 routers, specifically versions V15.03.05.19(6318)_CN(AC9), V15.03.05.19_CN(AC15), V15.03.05.19(6318)_CN(AC18) and earlier.
*   The Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates using `wget` to make an http request to an attacker controlled server, which confirms the arbitrary command execution vulnerability.
