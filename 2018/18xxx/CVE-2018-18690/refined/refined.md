  "CVE-2018-18690": {
    "description": "Kanda Motohiro discovered that writing extended attributes to an XFS file system in the Linux kernel in certain situations could cause an error condition to occur. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability occurs when an extended attribute (xattr) is being replaced with a larger value, which requires converting the storage format from shortform to leaf. The XFS code incorrectly handles the ATTR_REPLACE flag during this conversion. Specifically, the old shortform xattr is removed, and the code attempts to add the new (larger) xattr in leaf format, but it does not clear the ATTR_REPLACE flag. This causes a failure and file system shutdown because the old attr is already removed.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Incorrect handling of ATTR_REPLACE flag when converting xattr storage format",
      "Logic error leading to file system corruption"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (system crash), file system corruption",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to an XFS file system.",
       "Writing extended attributes to the file system"
