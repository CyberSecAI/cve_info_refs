…TR_REPLACE

Kanda Motohiro reported that expanding a tiny xattr into a large xattr
fails on XFS because we remove the tiny xattr from a shortform fork and
then try to re-add it after converting the fork to extents format having
not removed the ATTR_REPLACE flag.  This fails because the attr is no
longer present, causing a fs shutdown.

This is derived from the patch in his bug report, but we really
shouldn't ignore a nonzero retval from the remove call.

# USN-3849-2: Linux kernel (Trusty HWE) vulnerabilities

20 December 2018

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-trusty](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-trusty) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Trusty for Precise ESM

## Details

USN-3849-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 14.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 14.04 LTS for Ubuntu

12.04 ESM.

It was discovered that a NULL pointer dereference existed in the keyring

subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-2647](/security/CVE-2017-2647))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the raw MIDI driver for

the Linux kernel, leading to a double free vulnerability. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-10902](/security/CVE-2018-10902))

It was discovered that an integer overrun vulnerability existed in the

POSIX timers implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-12896](/security/CVE-2018-12896))

Noam Rathaus discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the

Infiniband implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-14734](/security/CVE-2018-14734))

It was discovered that the YUREX USB device driver for the Linux kernel did

not properly restrict user space reads or writes. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-16276](/security/CVE-2018-16276))

Tetsuo Handa discovered a logic error in the TTY subsystem of the Linux

kernel. A local attacker with access to pseudo terminal devices could use

this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-18386](/security/CVE-2018-18386))

Kanda Motohiro discovered that writing extended attributes to an XFS file

system in the Linux kernel in certain situations could cause an error

condition to occur. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service. ([CVE-2018-18690](/security/CVE-2018-18690))

It was discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in the

CDROM driver of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-18710](/security/CVE-2018-18710))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.13.0-164-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-164.214~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-164.214~precise1)
* [linux-image-generic-lpae-lts-trusty](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0.164.154](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-164.214~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.13.0-164-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-164.214~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-164.214~precise1)
* [linux-image-generic-lts-trusty](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0.164.154](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-164.214~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

* [linux-lts-xenial](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-xenial) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Xenial for Trusty

## Details

USN-3848-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu

14.04 LTS.

It was discovered that a double free existed in the AMD GPIO driver in the

Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-18174](/security/CVE-2017-18174))

It was discovered that an integer overrun vulnerability existed in the

POSIX timers implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-12896](/security/CVE-2018-12896))

Kanda Motohiro discovered that writing extended attributes to an XFS file

system in the Linux kernel in certain situations could cause an error

condition to occur. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service. ([CVE-2018-18690](/security/CVE-2018-18690))

It was discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in the

CDROM driver of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-18710](/security/CVE-2018-18710))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

                 CVE-2019-6974 CVE-2019-7221 CVE-2019-7222 CVE-2019-9213

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2016-10741

    A race condition was discovered in XFS that would result in a
    crash (BUG). A local user permitted to write to an XFS volume
    could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-5753

    Further instances of code that was vulnerable to Spectre variant 1
    (bounds-check bypass) have been mitigated.

CVE-2017-13305

    A memory over-read was discovered in the keys subsystem's
    encrypted key type. A local user could use this for denial of
    service or possibly to read sensitive information.

CVE-2018-3639 (SSB)

    Multiple researchers have discovered that Speculative Store Bypass
    (SSB), a feature implemented in many processors, could be used to
    read sensitive information from another context. In particular,
    code in a software sandbox may be able to read sensitive
    information from outside the sandbox. This issue is also known as
    Spectre variant 4.

    This update fixes bugs in the mitigations for SSB for AMD
    processors.

CVE-2018-5848

    The wil6210 wifi driver did not properly validate lengths in scan
    and connection requests, leading to a possible buffer overflow.
    On systems using this driver, a local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability could use this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or potentially for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-5953

    The swiotlb subsystem printed kernel memory addresses to the
    system log, which could help a local attacker to exploit other
    vulnerabilities.

CVE-2018-12896, CVE-2018-13053

    Team OWL337 reported possible integer overflows in the POSIX
    timer implementation. These might have some security impact.

CVE-2018-16862

    Vasily Averin and Pavel Tikhomirov from Virtuozzo Kernel Team
    discovered that the cleancache memory management feature did not
    invalidate cached data for deleted files. On Xen guests using the
    tmem driver, local users could potentially read data from other
    users' deleted files if they were able to create new files on the
    same volume.

CVE-2018-16884

    A flaw was found in the NFS 4.1 client implementation. Mounting
    NFS shares in multiple network namespaces at the same time could
    lead to a user-after-free. Local users might be able to use this
    for denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

    This can be mitigated by disabling unprivileged users from
    creating user namespaces, which is the default in Debian.

CVE-2018-17972

    Jann Horn reported that the /proc/*/stack files in procfs leaked
    sensitive data from the kernel. These files are now only readable
    by users with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (usually only root)

CVE-2018-18281

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the virtual memory manager
    that can result in a process briefly having access to memory after
    it is freed and reallocated. A local user permitted to create
    containers could possibly exploit this for denial of service
    (memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-18690

    Kanda Motohiro reported that XFS did not correctly handle some
    xattr (extended attribute) writes that require changing the disk
    format of the xattr. A user with access to an XFS volume could use
    this for denial of service.

CVE-2018-18710

    It was discovered that the cdrom driver does not correctly
    validate the parameter to the CDROM_SELECT_DISC ioctl. A user with
    access to a cdrom device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-19824

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a use-after-free bug in the
    USB audio driver. A physically present attacker able to attach a
    specially designed USB device could use this for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2018-19985

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a missing bounds check in the
    hso USB serial driver. A physically present user able to attach a
    specially designed USB device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-20169

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered missing bounds checks in the
    USB core. A physically present attacker able to attach a specially
    designed USB device could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-20511

    InfoSect reported an information leak in the AppleTalk IP/DDP
    implemntation. A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could
    use this to read sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-3701

    Muyu Yu and Marcus Meissner reported that the CAN gateway
    implementation allowed the frame length to be modified, typically
    resulting in out-of-bounds memory-mapped I/O writes.  On a system
    with CAN devices present, a local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability in the initial net namespace could use this to cause a
    crash (oops) or other hardware-dependent impact.

CVE-2019-3819

    A potential infinite loop was discovered in the HID debugfs
    interface exposed under /sys/kernel/debug/hid. A user with access
    to these files could use this for denial of service.

    This interface is only accessible to root by default, which fully
    mitigates the issue.

CVE-2019-6974

    Jann Horn reported a use-after-free bug in KVM. A local user
    with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of
    service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-7221

    Jim Mattson and Felix Wilhelm reported a user-after-free bug in
    KVM's nested VMX implementation. On systems with Intel CPUs, a
    local user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

    Nested VMX is disabled by default, which fully mitigates the
    issue.

CVE-2019-7222

    Felix Wilhelm reported an information leak in KVM for x86.
    A local user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to read
    sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-9213

    Jann Horn reported that privileged tasks could cause stack
    segments, including those in other processes, to grow downward to
    address 0. On systems lacking SMAP (x86) or PAN (ARM), this
    exacerbated other vulnerabilities: a null pointer dereference
    could be exploited for privilege escalation rather than only for
    denial of service.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.64-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

## Details

USN-3847-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 18.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

kernel for Microsoft Azure Cloud systems for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the raw MIDI driver for

the Linux kernel, leading to a double free vulnerability. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-10902](/security/CVE-2018-10902))

It was discovered that an integer overrun vulnerability existed in the

POSIX timers implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-12896](/security/CVE-2018-12896))

Noam Rathaus discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the

Infiniband implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-14734](/security/CVE-2018-14734))

It was discovered that the YUREX USB device driver for the Linux kernel did

not properly restrict user space reads or writes. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-16276](/security/CVE-2018-16276))

It was discovered that the BPF verifier in the Linux kernel did not

correctly compute numeric bounds in some situations. A local attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-18445](/security/CVE-2018-18445))

Kanda Motohiro discovered that writing extended attributes to an XFS file

system in the Linux kernel in certain situations could cause an error

condition to occur. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service. ([CVE-2018-18690](/security/CVE-2018-18690))

It was discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in the

CDROM driver of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-18710](/security/CVE-2018-18710))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 14.04

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# USN-3848-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

20 December 2018

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel
* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-kvm](/security/cves?package=linux-kvm) - Linux kernel for cloud environments
* [linux-raspi2](/security/cves?package=linux-raspi2) - Linux kernel for Raspberry Pi 2
* [linux-snapdragon](/security/cves?package=linux-snapdragon) - Linux kernel for Snapdragon processors

## Details

It was discovered that a double free existed in the AMD GPIO driver in the

Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-18174](/security/CVE-2017-18174))

It was discovered that an integer overrun vulnerability existed in the

POSIX timers implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-12896](/security/CVE-2018-12896))

Kanda Motohiro discovered that writing extended attributes to an XFS file

system in the Linux kernel in certain situations could cause an error

condition to occur. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service. ([CVE-2018-18690](/security/CVE-2018-18690))

It was discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in the

CDROM driver of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-18710](/security/CVE-2018-18710))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=199119#c0)  Kanda Motohiro    2018-03-15 05:58:56 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 274733](attachment.cgi?id=274733 "reproducer") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=274733&action=edit "reproducer") reproducer  Summary:  When the new xattr value will not fit in short form, conversion to leaf takes place. XFS first removes the old value, converts, then tries to add the new name. But if the request has XATTR_REPLACE, XFS gives up and returns ENOATTR. The file is left with the xattr removed, and filesystem metadata seems to be corrupted.  How to reproduce:  Run attached setattr.c. It will 1. Create a file /mnt/xfs/hello or whatever. 2. Add xattr "world" with value "0". This will be in short form. 3. Replace the xattr with value 2048 bytes. This forces conversion to leaf. 4. setxattr fails with ENOATTR. The file loses xattr "world" and you need fsrepair.

# USN-3847-2: Linux kernel (HWE) vulnerabilities

20 December 2018

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux-aws-hwe](/security/cves?package=linux-aws-hwe) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS-HWE) systems
* [linux-azure](/security/cves?package=linux-azure) - Linux kernel for Microsoft Azure Cloud systems
* [linux-gcp](/security/cves?package=linux-gcp) - Linux kernel for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) systems
* [linux-hwe](/security/cves?package=linux-hwe) - Linux hardware enablement (HWE) kernel

## Details

USN-3847-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 18.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 18.04 LTS for Ubuntu

16.04 LTS.

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the raw MIDI driver for

the Linux kernel, leading to a double free vulnerability. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-10902](/security/CVE-2018-10902))

It was discovered that an integer overrun vulnerability existed in the

POSIX timers implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-12896](/security/CVE-2018-12896))

Noam Rathaus discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the

Infiniband implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-14734](/security/CVE-2018-14734))

It was discovered that the YUREX USB device driver for the Linux kernel did

not properly restrict user space reads or writes. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-16276](/security/CVE-2018-16276))

It was discovered that the BPF verifier in the Linux kernel did not

correctly compute numeric bounds in some situations. A local attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-18445](/security/CVE-2018-18445))

Kanda Motohiro discovered that writing extended attributes to an XFS file

system in the Linux kernel in certain situations could cause an error

condition to occur. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service. ([CVE-2018-18690](/security/CVE-2018-18690))

It was discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in the

CDROM driver of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-18710](/security/CVE-2018-18710))

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-1031-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-1031.33~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws-hwe/4.15.0-1031.33~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-43-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-43.46~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.15.0-43.46~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-43-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-43.46~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.15.0-43.46~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-43-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-43.46~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.15.0-43.46~16.04.1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

Debian Bug     : 890034 896911 907581 915229 915231

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2017-18249

    A race condition was discovered in the disk space allocator of
    F2FS. A user with access to an F2FS volume could use this to cause
    a denial of service or other security impact.

CVE-2018-1128, CVE-2018-1129

    The cephx authentication protocol used by Ceph was susceptible to
    replay attacks, and calculated signatures incorrectly. These
    vulnerabilities in the server required changes to authentication
    that are incompatible with existing clients. The kernel's client
    code has now been updated to be compatible with the fixed server.

CVE-2018-3639 (SSB)

    Multiple researchers have discovered that Speculative Store Bypass
    (SSB), a feature implemented in many processors, could be used to
    read sensitive information from another context. In particular,
    code in a software sandbox may be able to read sensitive
    information from outside the sandbox. This issue is also known as
    Spectre variant 4.

    This update adds a further mitigation for this issue in the eBPF
    (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) implementation.

CVE-2018-5391 (FragmentSmack)

    Juha-Matti Tilli discovered a flaw in the way the Linux kernel
    handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote
    attacker can take advantage of this flaw to trigger time and
    calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithms by sending
    specially crafted packets, leading to remote denial of service.

    This was previously mitigated by reducing the default limits on
    memory usage for incomplete fragmented packets. This update
    replaces that mitigation with a more complete fix.

CVE-2018-5848

    The wil6210 wifi driver did not properly validate lengths in scan
    and connection requests, leading to a possible buffer overflow.
    On systems using this driver, a local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability could use this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or potentially for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-12896, CVE-2018-13053

    Team OWL337 reported possible integer overflows in the POSIX
    timer implementation. These might have some security impact.

CVE-2018-13096, CVE-2018-13097, CVE-2018-13100, CVE-2018-14614,
CVE-2018-14616

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported that crafted F2FS volumes
    could trigger a crash (BUG, Oops, or division by zero) and/or
    out-of-bounds memory access. An attacker able to mount such a
    volume could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-13406

    Dr Silvio Cesare of InfoSect reported a potential integer overflow
    in the uvesafb driver. A user with permission to access such a
    device might be able to use this for denial of service or
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-14610, CVE-2018-14611, CVE-2018-14612, CVE-2018-14613

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported that crafted Btrfs volumes
    could trigger a crash (Oops) and/or out-of-bounds memory access.
    An attacker able to mount such a volume could use this to cause a
    denial of service or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-15471 ((XSA-270)

    Felix Wilhelm of Google Project Zero discovered a flaw in the hash
    handling of the xen-netback Linux kernel module. A malicious or
    buggy frontend may cause the (usually privileged) backend to make
    out of bounds memory accesses, potentially resulting in privilege
    escalation, denial of service, or information leaks.

    <https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-270.html>

CVE-2018-16862

    Vasily Averin and Pavel Tikhomirov from Virtuozzo Kernel Team
    discovered that the cleancache memory management feature did not
    invalidate cached data for deleted files. On Xen guests using the
    tmem driver, local users could potentially read data from other
    users' deleted files if they were able to create new files on the
    same volume.

CVE-2018-17972

    Jann Horn reported that the /proc/*/stack files in procfs leaked
    sensitive data from the kernel. These files are now only readable
    by users with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (usually only root)

CVE-2018-18281

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the virtual memory manager
    that can result in a process briefly having access to memory after
    it is freed and reallocated. A local user could possibly exploit
    this for denial of service (memory corruption) or for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2018-18690

    Kanda Motohiro reported that XFS did not correctly handle some
    xattr (extended attribute) writes that require changing the disk
    format of the xattr. A user with access to an XFS volume could use
    this for denial of service.

CVE-2018-18710

    It was discovered that the cdrom driver does not correctly
    validate the parameter to the CDROM_SELECT_DISC ioctl. A user with
    access to a cdrom device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-19407

    Wei Wu reported a potential crash (Oops) in the KVM implementation
    for x86 processors. A user with access to /dev/kvm could use this
    for denial of service.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.144-3.1~deb8u1.  This version also includes fixes for Debian bugs
#890034, #896911, #907581, #915229, and #915231; and other fixes
included in upstream stable updates.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.9 packages.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

xfs: don't fail when converting shortform attr to long form during ATTR\_REPLACEKanda Motohiro reported that expanding a tiny xattr into a large xattr
fails on XFS because we remove the tiny xattr from a shortform fork and
then try to re-add it after converting the fork to extents format having
not removed the ATTR\_REPLACE flag. This fails because the attr is no
longer present, causing a fs shutdown.
This is derived from the patch in his bug report, but we really
shouldn't ignore a nonzero retval from the remove call.

Debian Bug     : 925919

The linux update issued as DLA-1731-1 caused a regression in the
vmxnet3 (VMware virtual network adapter) driver.  This update corrects
that regression, and an earlier regression in the CIFS network
filesystem implementation introduced in DLA-1422-1.  For reference the
original advisory text follows.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2016-10741

    A race condition was discovered in XFS that would result in a
    crash (BUG). A local user permitted to write to an XFS volume
    could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-5753

    Further instances of code that was vulnerable to Spectre variant 1
    (bounds-check bypass) have been mitigated.

CVE-2017-13305

    A memory over-read was discovered in the keys subsystem's
    encrypted key type. A local user could use this for denial of
    service or possibly to read sensitive information.

CVE-2018-3639 (SSB)

    Multiple researchers have discovered that Speculative Store Bypass
    (SSB), a feature implemented in many processors, could be used to
    read sensitive information from another context. In particular,
    code in a software sandbox may be able to read sensitive
    information from outside the sandbox. This issue is also known as
    Spectre variant 4.

    This update fixes bugs in the mitigations for SSB for AMD
    processors.

CVE-2018-5848

    The wil6210 wifi driver did not properly validate lengths in scan
    and connection requests, leading to a possible buffer overflow.
    On systems using this driver, a local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability could use this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or potentially for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-5953

    The swiotlb subsystem printed kernel memory addresses to the
    system log, which could help a local attacker to exploit other
    vulnerabilities.

CVE-2018-12896, CVE-2018-13053

    Team OWL337 reported possible integer overflows in the POSIX
    timer implementation. These might have some security impact.

CVE-2018-16862

    Vasily Averin and Pavel Tikhomirov from Virtuozzo Kernel Team
    discovered that the cleancache memory management feature did not
    invalidate cached data for deleted files. On Xen guests using the
    tmem driver, local users could potentially read data from other
    users' deleted files if they were able to create new files on the
    same volume.

CVE-2018-16884

    A flaw was found in the NFS 4.1 client implementation. Mounting
    NFS shares in multiple network namespaces at the same time could
    lead to a user-after-free. Local users might be able to use this
    for denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

    This can be mitigated by disabling unprivileged users from
    creating user namespaces, which is the default in Debian.

CVE-2018-17972

    Jann Horn reported that the /proc/*/stack files in procfs leaked
    sensitive data from the kernel. These files are now only readable
    by users with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (usually only root)

CVE-2018-18281

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the virtual memory manager
    that can result in a process briefly having access to memory after
    it is freed and reallocated. A local user permitted to create
    containers could possibly exploit this for denial of service
    (memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-18690

    Kanda Motohiro reported that XFS did not correctly handle some
    xattr (extended attribute) writes that require changing the disk
    format of the xattr. A user with access to an XFS volume could use
    this for denial of service.

CVE-2018-18710

    It was discovered that the cdrom driver does not correctly
    validate the parameter to the CDROM_SELECT_DISC ioctl. A user with
    access to a cdrom device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-19824

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a use-after-free bug in the
    USB audio driver. A physically present attacker able to attach a
    specially designed USB device could use this for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2018-19985

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a missing bounds check in the
    hso USB serial driver. A physically present user able to attach a
    specially designed USB device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-20169

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered missing bounds checks in the
    USB core. A physically present attacker able to attach a specially
    designed USB device could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-20511

    InfoSect reported an information leak in the AppleTalk IP/DDP
    implemntation. A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could
    use this to read sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-3701

    Muyu Yu and Marcus Meissner reported that the CAN gateway
    implementation allowed the frame length to be modified, typically
    resulting in out-of-bounds memory-mapped I/O writes.  On a system
    with CAN devices present, a local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability in the initial net namespace could use this to cause a
    crash (oops) or other hardware-dependent impact.

CVE-2019-3819

    A potential infinite loop was discovered in the HID debugfs
    interface exposed under /sys/kernel/debug/hid. A user with access
    to these files could use this for denial of service.

    This interface is only accessible to root by default, which fully
    mitigates the issue.

CVE-2019-6974

    Jann Horn reported a use-after-free bug in KVM. A local user
    with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of
    service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-7221

    Jim Mattson and Felix Wilhelm reported a user-after-free bug in
    KVM's nested VMX implementation. On systems with Intel CPUs, a
    local user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

    Nested VMX is disabled by default, which fully mitigates the
    issue.

CVE-2019-7222

    Felix Wilhelm reported an information leak in KVM for x86.
    A local user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to read
    sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-9213

    Jann Horn reported that privileged tasks could cause stack
    segments, including those in other processes, to grow downward to
    address 0. On systems lacking SMAP (x86) or PAN (ARM), this
    exacerbated other vulnerabilities: a null pointer dereference
    could be exploited for privilege escalation rather than only for
    denial of service.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.64-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
