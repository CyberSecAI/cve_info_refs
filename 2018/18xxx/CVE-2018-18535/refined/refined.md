```
{
  "CVE-2018-18535": {
    "Root cause": "The Asusgio driver exposes functionality to read and write Machine Specific Registers (MSRs) without proper access control.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Exposed IOCTL with Insufficient Access Control [CWE-782]"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can leverage the MSR read/write functionality to execute arbitrary code at ring-0 (kernel) level. This includes potentially bypassing KASLR by reading kernel function pointers, and writing arbitrary values to MSRs which can lead to system instability, crashes (BSOD), or complete control over the system.",
    "Attack vectors": "A local attacker can send IOCTL commands to the vulnerable Asusgio driver.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute code locally on the target machine. The attacker does not need administrative privileges, as the driver allows access from low-integrity processes."
