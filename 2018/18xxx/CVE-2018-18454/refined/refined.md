The provided content from github.com details multiple vulnerabilities found in xpdf version 4.00. The vulnerabilities are related to heap buffer overflows, stack buffer overflows, and out-of-bounds reads when processing specially crafted PDF files. These vulnerabilities are located in various functions within the `Stream.cc`, `Object.h`, and `GfxState.cc` files. Here's a breakdown of each:

**1. `DCTStream::readScan@Stream.cc-3051___out-of-bounds-read`**

*   **Root Cause:** Out-of-bounds read in the `DCTStream::readScan` function.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Out-of-bounds read.
*   **Impact:** Causes a segmentation fault due to reading memory outside the allocated buffer, leading to denial of service.
*   **Attack Vector:** A specially crafted PDF file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to create or modify a PDF file that triggers the vulnerability.

**2. `CCITTFaxStream::readRow@Stream.cc-1822___heap-buffer-overflow`**
*   **Root Cause:** Heap buffer overflow in the `CCITTFaxStream::readRow` function.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Heap buffer overflow.
*  **Impact**: Potential for arbitrary code execution if the overflow is carefully crafted. In this case, a crash (denial of service) is observed.
*   **Attack Vector:** A specially crafted PDF file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to create or modify a PDF file that triggers the vulnerability.

**3. `Object::isName@Object.h-134___stack-buffer-overflow`**

*   **Root Cause:** Stack buffer overflow in the `Object::isName` function.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Stack buffer overflow.
*   **Impact:** Can lead to arbitrary code execution if the overflow is carefully crafted or a denial of service in this specific case.
*  **Attack Vector:** A specially crafted PDF file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to create or modify a PDF file that triggers the vulnerability.

**4. `DCTStream::getBlock@Stream.cc-2812___out-of-bounds-read`**

*   **Root Cause:** Out-of-bounds read in the `DCTStream::getBlock` function.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Out-of-bounds read.
*   **Impact:** Segmentation fault due to memory access violation, resulting in a denial of service.
*   **Attack Vector:** A specially crafted PDF file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to create or modify a PDF file that triggers the vulnerability.

**5. `DCTStream::readHuffSym@Stream.cc-3662___heap-buffer-overflow`**

*   **Root Cause:** Heap buffer overflow in the `DCTStream::readHuffSym` function.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Heap buffer overflow.
*  **Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution if the overflow is carefully crafted. In this case, a crash (denial of service) is observed.
*   **Attack Vector:** A specially crafted PDF file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to create or modify a PDF file that triggers the vulnerability.

**6. `DCTStream::decodeImage@Stream.cc-3325___out-of-bounds-read`**

*   **Root Cause:** Out-of-bounds read in the `DCTStream::decodeImage` function.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Out-of-bounds read.
*   **Impact:** Segmentation fault due to memory access violation, leading to denial of service.
*   **Attack Vector:** A specially crafted PDF file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to create or modify a PDF file that triggers the vulnerability.

**7. `GfxImageColorMap::GfxImageColorMap@GfxState.cc-3550___heap-buffer-overflow`**

*   **Root Cause:** Heap buffer overflow in the `GfxImageColorMap::GfxImageColorMap` function.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Heap buffer overflow.
*  **Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution if the overflow is carefully crafted. In this case, a crash (denial of service) is observed.
*   **Attack Vector:** A specially crafted PDF file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to create or modify a PDF file that triggers the vulnerability.

**Commonalities:**

*   All vulnerabilities are triggered by a specially crafted PDF file.
*   The primary attack vector is through the `pdftoppm` tool.
*   The vulnerabilities result in either a denial-of-service (crashes due to segmentation faults or memory access violations) or potential for arbitrary code execution due to buffer overflows.

**Additional Notes:**
