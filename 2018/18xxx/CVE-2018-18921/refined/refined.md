Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-18921:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of anti-CSRF tokens on certain delete actions within the PHP Server Monitor application. Specifically, the actions to delete servers, users, and all logs were vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The application failed to implement proper CSRF protection on key administrative functions, specifically delete actions for users, servers, and logs. These actions were performed via GET requests without requiring a CSRF token.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to perform unauthorized actions such as deleting users, servers, or all logs on the target application. This can lead to a denial of service, data loss, or complete compromise of the monitored servers and their configurations.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves an attacker crafting a malicious link or HTML form that, when clicked by a logged-in administrator, will trigger the vulnerable delete actions on the application. This malicious payload can be delivered through various means, such as phishing emails or malicious websites.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator of the PHP Server Monitor application into interacting with a malicious link or HTML form. The attacker does not need to have any prior access or credentials for the application. The attacker crafts malicious URLs and hides them with URL shorteners, or crafts forms to perform actions.
