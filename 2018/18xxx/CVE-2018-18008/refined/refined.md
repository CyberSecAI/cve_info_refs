- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The web interface of affected D-Link devices exposes the administrator's password in clear text within the `spaces.htm` page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Clear text storage of the admin password, lack of authentication check when accessing the `spaces.htm` page.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can obtain the administrator's password, which could allow them to gain complete control of the device.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote access via the web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker only needs network access to the device's web interface and does not require prior authentication.
