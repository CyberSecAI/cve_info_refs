The provided content describes a heap overflow vulnerability in Tenda routers.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the httpd web server of Tenda routers. Specifically, the `mac` parameter from a POST request is copied directly to a heap-allocated variable using `strcpy` without any bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap overflow due to the usage of `strcpy` with no size limitations, allowing data to write past the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- It can potentially leak sensitive information.
- It can also allow for hijacking of the program's control flow (remote code execution).

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted POST request with an overly large `mac` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the affected router's web server. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
