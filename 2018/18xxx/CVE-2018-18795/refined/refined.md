```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application's `student/view.php`, `event/view.php`, and `user/view.php` pages are vulnerable to SQL injection because they directly use the `id` parameter from the GET request in SQL queries without proper sanitization.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. In this specific case, the provided exploit extracts database schema information.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is triggered through HTTP GET requests to specific files (`student/index.php`, `event/index.php`, `user/index.php`) with a manipulated `id` parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is mentioned as being necessary.
