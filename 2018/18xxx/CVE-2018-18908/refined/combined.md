# Sky - Plain Text Data Transmission (CVE-2018-18908 )

![Sky - Plain Text Data Transmission (CVE-2018-18908 )](/content/images/size/w100/2019/01/app-entertainment-ipad-265685-2.jpg)

# Finding

**Date Published:** 19 January 2019
**CVE:** CVE-2018-18908
**CVSSv3 Base Score:** 5.4 [(CVSS3:AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=CVSS3%3AAV%3AN%2FAC%3AL%2FPR%3AN%2FUI%3AR%2FS%3AU%2FC%3AL%2FI%3AL%2FA%3AN&ref=blog.sean-wright.com)
**Vendors Contacted:** Sky
**Discovered By:** Sean Wright

## Summary

The Sky Go Windows Desktop application performs several requests over plain HTTP. This makes the data submitted in these requests prone to Man in The Middle (MiTM) attacks, whereby an attacker would be able to obtain the data sent in these requests. Some of the requests contain potentially sensitive information which could be useful to an attacker.

## Version Affected

1.0.23-1 – 1.0.19-1 (possibly further versions as well).

## Details

When the application is initially installed and run, there victim’s Sky username is present in several requests which are performed over plain HTTP. Thus an attacker who is able to gain access to these requests via a MiTM attack, would be able to gain the victim’s username.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Start up Ettercap on the attacking system to perform an ARP spoof on the victim which will be running the Sky Go desktop application: `sudo ettercap -T -i wlp58s0 -M arp:remote /192.168.0.163// ///`
2. Setup iptables rules on the attacking system to route traffic over HTTP to a local proxy: `sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080`
3. Using a local proxy such are Burp Suite, configure it to listen for traffic in an invisible proxying mode: a. In the *Proxy* tab, select the *Options* subtab and then select the current listener and click on the *Edit* button.  b. Set the *Bind* to address radio button to be *All interfaces*.  c. Click on the *Request handling* tab and check the *Support invisible proxying* checkbox.  d. Click on the *OK* button to accept the changes.
4. Startup the Sky Go application on the victim system, and log into your Sky account.
5. Monitor the traffic logs in Burp Suite and note the requests for [http://init.sky.com/:](http://init.sky.com/%3A?ref=blog.sean-wright.com)

## CVSS 3

**CVSS Vector:** [CVSS3:AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=CVSS3%3AAV%3AN%2FAC%3AL%2FPR%3AN%2FUI%3AR%2FS%3AU%2FC%3AL%2FI%3AL%2FA%3AN&ref=blog.sean-wright.com)
**Base Score:** 5.4
