Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-18908:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Sky Go Windows Desktop application transmits data, including usernames, over plain HTTP instead of HTTPS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Plain Text Data Transmission: The application uses HTTP, which does not encrypt data in transit, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping.
- Lack of Encryption: Sensitive information like usernames are sent without encryption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Confidentiality Breach: An attacker can intercept network traffic and obtain the victim's Sky username.
- Potential for Further Attacks: Gaining the username can be a stepping stone for more sophisticated attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack: The primary attack vector involves an attacker intercepting the victim's network traffic. This requires the attacker to be in a position to intercept network communications between the victim and the Sky servers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be on the same network as the victim or in a position to intercept the victim's network traffic, such as on a shared Wi-Fi network.
- Ability to Perform MitM: The attacker needs the ability to perform an ARP spoof to redirect traffic through the attacker's machine.
- Proxy Setup: The attacker needs to set up a proxy server (e.g., Burp Suite) to capture and view the traffic.
- Minimal technical skills: The attack itself is not difficult.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Sky Go Windows Desktop application versions 1.0.23-1 to 1.0.19-1 and possibly earlier versions.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Sean Wright and publicly disclosed on January 19, 2019.
- The vendor (Sky) was notified of the issue on May 22, 2018 and was still in the process of releasing a fix by November 20, 2018.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 5.4 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N).
