  "CVE-2018-18584": {
    "description": "In mspack/cab.h in libmspack before 0.8alpha and cabextract before 1.8, the CAB block input buffer is one byte too small for the maximal Quantum block, leading to an out-of-bounds write.",

        "Out-of-bounds write"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can cause an out-of-bounds write which could lead to a crash of the application, resulting in a denial-of-service.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Processing a specially crafted CAB file."
