- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application uses JSON artifacts to render security reports and license management reports. These reports contain fields that are rendered as links (`<a>`) where the `href` attribute is filled with unsanitized URLs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to unsanitized URLs being used in the `href` attribute of `<a>` tags.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts by providing a crafted URL. This could lead to various attacks such as session hijacking, phishing, or defacement.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker would need to provide malicious URLs within the JSON artifacts used for security and license management reports.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to be able to influence the data that is included in the JSON artifacts, which are then processed by the GitLab application. This might be achieved by manipulating reports generated by SAST, DAST, Container Scanning, Dependency Scanning, or License Management tools.
