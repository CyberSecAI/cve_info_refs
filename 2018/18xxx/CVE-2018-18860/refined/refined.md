Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-18860:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the overly permissive file permissions set by the `fix_permissions.sh` script after the installation or update of the SwitchVPN application on macOS. This script changes ownership of application binaries to `root`, makes them world-writable, and sets the SUID bit on the `compose8` binary.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Overly Permissive File Permissions:** The script `fix_permissions.sh` sets the permissions of the SwitchVPN application directory and its contents to 777, making all files world-writable.
*   **SUID Bit on `compose8`:** The SUID bit is set on the `compose8` binary, allowing any user to execute it with root privileges.
*   **Execution of `SwitchVPN_GUI` as root:** The `SwitchVPN_GUI` binary is executed as root, and due to the world-writable permissions, it can be modified by any local user.
*   **Chained Execution:** The `SwitchVPN` binary executes the SUID `compose8` binary, which in turn executes the world-writable `SwitchVPN_GUI` binary.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a local, unprivileged attacker to escalate their privileges to root. This provides the attacker with full control over the compromised system, potentially leading to:

*   Complete system compromise
*   Data theft
*   Malware installation
*   Denial of Service (DoS)

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the vulnerable macOS system where the SwitchVPN application is installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a local user on the macOS system with SwitchVPN installed.
*   The attacker needs the ability to write to the SwitchVPN application directory and its contents due to the world-writable permissions.

**Detailed Explanation:**

1.  **Vulnerable Script:** The `fix_permissions.sh` script sets insecure file permissions, making the application vulnerable.
2.  **Exploitation:** An attacker can modify the `SwitchVPN_GUI` binary with a malicious script. When the `SwitchVPN` application is executed (or the SUID binary is executed), it will execute the attacker's malicious payload as root, gaining root privileges.
3.  **Proof of Concept:** The proof-of-concept detailed in the provided content involves overwriting `SwitchVPN_GUI` with a script that sets SUID on a shell and then executing this shell.

**Vulnerable Version:**

The vulnerability has been confirmed to exist in version 2.1012.03 of the SwitchVPN application for macOS. Earlier versions may also be vulnerable.

**Timeline of Vendor Contact:**

The security researcher contacted the vendor multiple times regarding the vulnerability before releasing the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

**Solution and Workaround:**

At the time of the advisory, there was no fix available. The advisory recommends users uninstall the software until a patch is released. There was no workaround provided.
