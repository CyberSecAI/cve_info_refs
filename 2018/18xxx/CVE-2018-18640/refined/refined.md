- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Inadequate cache control on most pages related to private projects.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information Disclosure due to improper caching.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized users can view the contents of private projects, including file names, source code, commit logs, issues, and wiki contents, by using the browser's back button after a user has logged out.
- **Attack vectors**: Physical access to a computer that was previously used to log into GitLab.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs physical access to the victim's computer after the victim has logged out from GitLab but before the browser history has been cleared. The attacker doesn't need to be logged in to the system.
