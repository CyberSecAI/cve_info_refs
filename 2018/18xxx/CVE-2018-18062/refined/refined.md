{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the 'dialog.php' file, leading to a reflected XSS.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML into the victim's browser within the security context of the vulnerable web site. This could lead to stealing of cookie-based authentication credentials or other malicious actions.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "A specially crafted URL, with malicious script injected into the 'secretkey' parameter of 'dialog.php', is sent to the victim. When the victim clicks the link, the script is executed."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick a victim into clicking on it. The attacker does not need prior access to the system.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerable parameter is 'secretkey' within the URL. The proof of concept provided shows how an alert box can be displayed by crafting a URL with the payload:  <http://localhost/filemanager/dialog.php?secretkey=\"/>><script>alert(1)</script>"
  }
