## Changes in Version 9.4.0 (2014/04/02)

Special thanks for this upgrade to Miklós Bencze Mikeyhun

Major:
- Cut/copy/paste support
- Drag&drop support
- Few new icons
- Code refactor
- Bugfixes

Detailed:
- Cut/copy/paste
You can configure the actions in config.php file and disable/ limit them if needed.
When right clicking on a folder/file there will be options for copy and cut
(and paste if files on clipboard and righ clicked on a file)
There's icon for paste to this dir and clear clipboard after the 'new dir' icons
They will grey out if there's nothing on the clipboard.

- Drag&drop
Now you can drag n drop files/folders to other folders
(this will overwrite existing files if encountered any!)

- Icons
Added new icons for the new functions
All are legit made by me or get from free icon sites

- Code Refator
- Added bunch of comments and change a lot of codes.

- Changed all $\_SESSION vars to be in a separet array
eg.:$\_SESSION["verify"] -> $\_SESSION['RF']["verify"]
So now there won't be any problem with big projecfts integrating RF

- Added the lang file url to $\_SESSION['RF']['language\_file']
Now it can be included easily

- Added a lot of new lang. lines and feedback info
New lines added to every language (in english) so translation can go smoothly
(There are places where i added %s to lang lines which will be swapped with an action name
, commented out what will be inserted at runtime)

- Added timeout when closing upload tab

- Bugfixes
- Corrected issue #69 Dropzone spritemap.png problem
Now when loading a language it will search for the appropiate spritemaps.
If none found will fallback to english
All spritemaps should follow the language code naming eg:
For hu\_HU:
spritemap\_hu\_HU.png
spritemap@2x\_hu\_HU.png

(might consider moving them in a separte folder in the future)

- Fixed issue #71 The uploaded file exceeds the max size allowed
Now when uploading it properly check for max post size
It is dealt with in config.php after definning the max upload size and if it's bigger
than server's ini it will revert it back to it.

If you are updating from a previous version of FileManager delete the contents of thumbs folder, the script will automatically re-create the thumbnails.

!IMPORTANT: if you are using htaccess protection, make sure your $GLOBALS PHP\_AUTH\_USER/PHP\_AUTH\_USER are defined in your webserver config

Required in php.ini: extension=fileinfo

### Using Responsive File Manager in Joomla

Mihalis Miliarakis writed this usefull article: <http://ourlife01.blogspot.gr/2017/01/how-to-add-free-file-manager-in-joomla.html>
### USE AS TINYMCE 4 FILE MANAGER

* Copy tinymce/plugins/responsivefilemanager folder to tinymce/plugins/ in your server
  N.B.: REMEMBER THAT RESPONVIVEFILEMANAGER IS NOT FILEMANAGER FOLDER BUT AN ADDITIONAL PLUGIN
* Settings of tinymce should be like this: (remember to add responsivefilemanager in plugins list):
  > ```
  >
  > tinymce.init({
  >     selector: "textarea",theme: "modern",width: 680,height: 300,
  >     plugins: [
  >          "advlist autolink link image lists charmap print preview hr anchor pagebreak",
  >          "searchreplace wordcount visualblocks visualchars insertdatetime media nonbreaking",
  >          "table contextmenu directionality emoticons paste textcolor responsivefilemanager code"
  >    ],
  >    toolbar1: "undo redo | bold italic underline | alignleft aligncenter alignright alignjustify | bullist numlist outdent indent | styleselect",
  >    toolbar2: "| responsivefilemanager | link unlink anchor | image media | forecolor backcolor  | print preview code ",
  >    image_advtab: true ,
  >
  >    external_filemanager_path:"/filemanager/",
  >    filemanager_title:"Responsive Filemanager" ,
  >    external_plugins: { "filemanager" : "/filemanager/plugin.min.js"}
  >  });
  >
  > ```

  You can pass this variables on TinyMCE init.

  filemanager\_title the title of filemanager window default="Responsive filemanager"

  filemanager\_sort\_by: the element to sorting (values: name,size,extension,date) default=""

  filemanager\_descending: descending ? or ascending (values=1 or 0) default="0"

  If you want full path url in tinyMCE paths you can add relative\_urls: false on tinyMCE init (read [tinyMCE Configuration page](https://www.tinymce.com/wiki.php/Configuration))

  external\_filemanager\_path and external\_plugins path must be absolute from root and must point to filemanager folder not responsivefilemanager plugin folder
* Change the path in your tinymce init function in external\_filemanager\_path and external\_plugins (the path must be a absolute path from base\_url of your site and must start with / so in this example i have the filemanager folder in www.site.com/filemanager/)

If you are updating from older version (from 1 to 7) substitute your tinyMCE with new or download only the image/media/link originals folders and copy in your tinyMCE plugin folder
### USE AS CKEDITOR FILE MANAGER

Copy the filemanager folder where you want in your server

Add a textarea inside your page

Include CKeditor library ans add the init script of CKEditor:

The urls must point inside your filemanager folder so change they properly.

If you want pass other config variables in the url (like language) please see the below "Get Variables list" paragraph.

### USE AS CLEditor FILE MANAGER

* download jquery.cleditor.rfm.js file from [here](http://inft.ly/34hF8Rd)
* include this file after jquery.cleditor.min.js in your web site
* call $.cleditor.set\_rfm(path) function to set path to Responsive filemanager root directory where dialog.php exists
  e.g. $.cleditor.set\_rfm('libs/responsivefilemanager');
* and that is all, click on "Insert Image" toolbar button, browse for image(RFM), select image, Submit, and now you have image in you cleditor.

Thanks to Zoran Cindori for this plugin

### USE AS STAND-ALONE FILE MANAGER

You can use normal pop-up, Bootstrap modal, iframe, FancyBox iframe, Lightbox iframe to open the FileManager with these paths:

Only open filemanager(type=0 and not set field\_id):

path to filemanager../filemanager/dialog.php?type=0&fldr=

Select Image: (type=1 and set id of input text in field\_id variable):

path to filemanager../filemanager/dialog.php?type=1&field\_id=fieldID

Select Video: (type=3 and set id of input text in field\_id variable):

path to filemanager../filemanager/dialog.php?type=3&field\_id=fieldID

Select File: (type=2 and set id of input text in field\_id variable):

path to filemanager../filemanager/dialog.php?type=2&field\_id=fieldID

**Get Variables list**

**type**: the type of filemanager (1:images files 2:all files 3:video files)

**fldr**: the folder where i enter (the root folder remains the same). default=""

**sort\_by**: the element to sorting (values: name,size,extension,date) default=""

**descending**: descending? or ascending (values=1 or 0) default="0"

**lang**: the language code (ex: ⟨=en\_EN). default="en\_EN"

**relative\_url**: should be added to the request with a value of "1" when opening RFM. Otherwise returned URL-s will be absolute.
**extensions**: a json encoded array of available files extensions (ex: &extensions=["pdf",'doc'])

If you want use popup add in the address &popup=1

PS If you want to force loading at root set fldr to /

In demo page i used FancyBox with this configuration:

> ```
>
>     $('.iframe-btn').fancybox({
> 	'width'		: 900,
> 	'height'	: 600,
> 	'type'		: 'iframe',
>         'autoScale'    	: false
>     });
> ```

and the button has this code to open FileManager:

> ```
>
> <a href="js/tinymce/plugins/filemanager/dialog.php?type=0" class="btn iframe-btn" type="button">Open Filemanager</a>
> ```

Remember to include FancyBox, file in head section:

> ```
>
> <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="fancybox/jquery.fancybox-1.3.4.css" media="screen" />
> <script type="text/javascript" src="fancybox/jquery.fancybox-1.3.4.pack.js"></script>
> ```

If you not use FancyBox, you must use the callback function to close the window

or change the close function in filemanager/js/include.js:

> ```
>
> function close_window() {
>     parent.$.fancybox.close();
> }
> ```

In last version i added the default support to bootstrap modal close
### CALLBACK FUNCTION CALL after update a field

If you want change something on returned url after RFM click on a file; you can define the **responsive\_filemanager\_callback** function like this example:
```

function responsive_filemanager_callback(field_id){
	console.log(field_id);
	var url=jQuery('#'+field_id).val();
	alert('update '+field_id+" with "+url);
	//your code
}

```

### SECURITY ON RESPONSIVE FILEMANAGER

In config.php there is a part reserved to security pass
> define('USE\_ACCESS\_KEYS', FALSE);

if set to true only those will access RF whose url contains the access key(akey) like:
> ```
>
> < input type="button" href="../filemanager/dialog.php?field_id=imgField⟨=en_EN&akey=myPrivateKey" value="Files">
>
> ```

in tinymce a new parameter added: filemanager\_access\_key:"myPrivateKey"
example tinymce config:
tiny init ...

> ```
>
> external_filemanager_path:"../filemanager/",
> filemanager_title:"Filemanager" ,
> filemanager_access_key:"myPrivateKey" ,
>
> ```

In addition to this simple implementation there isn't security, because every php files include first config/config.php file.

So if you want to permit access only to a logged users you can add all the controls at beginning of config.php file.

### TRANSLITERATION and STRING CONVERSION

With standard configuration responsive filemanager accepts all type of characters for file and folder names (like à é & ¥..., arabian, Chinese),
if you want permits only latin charachters like A....Z a....z and 0....9, you can set to true the $transliteration variable on config.php .

### SET SUBFOLDER AS ROOT AND MULTI-USER USE

You can set a subfolder as root.
So you can have a root folder for each user.

The way to implement this is set the session variable $\_SESSION["RF"]["subfolder"] ="subfolder/name/"

Remember that subfolder value must not have ../ ./ . inside and can't begin with /

Folder Example:

root
-- folder1
---- subfolder1
---- subfolder2
-- folder2
 ----subfolder3

User1 subfolder=""
View:
folder1
 -- subfolder1
 -- subfolder2
folder2
 -- subfolder3

User 2 subfolder="folder1"
View:
subfolder1
subfolder2

So if you want use filemanager in a multiuser CMS you can simply create a folder for each user and set a session variable ($\_SESSION['RF']['subfolder']) with the name of the user folder.

### CUSTOMISE CONFIGURATION FOR EACH FOLDER (CONFIG.PHP)

In Responsive FileManager you can customise the config.php for each folder.
Simply create a config.php file inside your desired folder, and set the config array only with the element do you need to change. (Don't change current\_path,upload\_dir,base\_url,root).

You can also include an **HTML text in the display folder page** by simply inserting : 'folder\_message'=>"html message" inside the config.php file in the folder.
You can use this to specify restrictions or images resizing.

Remember that the configuration of one folder is reflected in all its subdirectories.
### CROSS DOMAIN USE

#### STAND-ALONE FILE MANAGER

To enable cross-domain file selector, where files are hosted on one server (for example, serverA.com) and URL is being sent to another (for example, serverB.com), include crossdomain=1 in the URL.

For example, to instantiate image picker, use the following URL:http://serverA.com/[path to filemanager]/filemanager/dialog.php?type=1&field\_id=fieldID&crossdomain=1

Then on serverB.com, the following code can be used to retrieve the URL after file selection is made. Please note, that the code is written for jQuery with FancyBox plug-in.

> ```
>
> 	//
> // Handles message from ResponsiveFilemanager
> //
> function OnMessage(e){
>   var event = e.originalEvent;
>    // Make sure the sender of the event is trusted
>    if(event.data.sender === 'responsivefilemanager'){
>       if(event.data.field_id){
>       	var fieldID=event.data.field_id;
>       	var url=event.data.url;
> 	$('#'+fieldID).val(url).trigger('change');
> 	$.fancybox.close();
>
> 	// Delete handler of the message from ResponsiveFilemanager
> 	$(window).off('message', OnMessage);
>       }
>    }
> }
>
> // Handler for a message from ResponsiveFilemanager
> $(‘.opener-class).on('click',function(){
>   $(window).on('message', OnMessage);
> });
>
> ```

#### FILE MANAGER AS TINYMCE PLUG-IN

There is extra parameter needed filemanager\_crossdomain when calling tinymce.init(), please see below.

> ```
> tinymce.init({
>    ...
>    filemanager_crossdomain: true,
>    external_filemanager_path:"http://path/secondaryserver/filemanager/",
>    external_plugins: { "responsivefilemanager" : "http://path/secondaryserver/filemanager/plugin.min.js"},
>    ...
> });
>
> ```

<https://www.drupal.org/node/2830625>

There is examples on [demo page](demo.php)

### CONFIG.PHP PARAMETERS SETTING

This is all parameters that you can change in config.php files

| Parameters stored only in config/config.php file | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Parameter | Example Value | Description |
| base\_url | http://site.com | base url of site (without final /). if you prefer relative urls leave empty. |
| upload\_dir | /uploads/ | address path from base\_url to base of upload folder (with start and final /). |
| current\_path | ../uploads/ | relative path from filemanager folder to upload folder (with final /). |

| MaxSizeUpload | 100 | Max size upload limit in Mb. |
| default\_language | en\_EN | default language file name. |
| icon\_theme | ico | the theme of icons. choose ico or ico\_dark or you can cusatomize just putting a folder inside filemanager/img |
| file\_number\_limit\_js | 500 | the filter and sorter are managed through both javascript and php scripts. If you have a lot of files in a folder the javascript script wil not cope, so the filemanager then switches to the php script. The plugin automatically switches from javascript to php when the folder contains more than the specified number of files. |
| show\_sorting\_bar | true | show or hide the sorting feature. |
| show\_folder\_size | true | show or hide the folder size in filemanager list view (very large folders greatly increase the calculation time). |
