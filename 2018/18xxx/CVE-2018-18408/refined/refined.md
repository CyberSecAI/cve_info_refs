{
  "CVE-2018-18408": {
    "Description": "A heap use-after-free issue exists in tcpbridge binary of tcpreplay, being triggered in function `post_args()` at file `src/tcpbridge.c`.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability occurs because the memory pointed to by `eth_buff` is freed by `sendpacket_close(sp)` on line 218 of `src/tcpbridge.c`, but then used in a memcpy on line 219 `memcpy(options.intf1_mac, eth_buff, ETHER_ADDR_LEN);` resulting in a use-after-free condition.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "Impact": "The impact of this vulnerability could lead to a crash, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
     "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by running the `tcpbridge` command with the `--intf1` argument.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need the ability to execute the `tcpbridge` command with a specific interface. No special privileges seem to be required but the application needs to run and process the command line arguments."
