- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper validation of a user-supplied value before dereferencing it as a pointer within the KERedirect kext.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Untrusted pointer dereference.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can execute code in the context of the kernel, leading to privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required; an attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
