The provided content describes a vulnerability in EmpireCMS 7.5 that allows for remote code execution (RCE) via uploading a malicious "mod" file.

*   **Vulnerability:** Remote Code Execution (RCE)
*   **Root cause:** The application allows users to import "mod" files without proper validation, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack vector:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted "mod" file through the "Manage Data Table" functionality in the system settings.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to be authenticated and have access to the "System Settings" and "Manage Data Table" functionalities.
