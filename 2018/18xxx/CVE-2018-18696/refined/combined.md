#####################################
Title: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Vulnerability in MicroStrategy Web application allows modifying user's
preferences.
Author: Wissam Bashour
Vendor: MicroStrategy
Product: MicroStrategy Web
Version: All versions below 10.4.0026.0049
Tested Version: Version 10.4.0026.0049
Severity: HIGH
CVE Reference: CVE-2018-18696

# About the Product:

# Description:
The application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). It is an attack that forces an end user to execute
unwanted actions on a web application in which they're currently authenticated. CSRF attacks specifically target
state-changing requests, not theft of data, since the
attacker has no way to see the response to the forged request.
An attacker may trick the users of the web application into executing actions of the attacker's choosing. If the victim
is a normal user, a successful CSRF attack can force the user to perform state changing requests like transferring
changing their email address, or any personal preferences.
An attacker could trick the users of the Microstrategy application into clicking on a link that will change the
victim's personal information or perform unwanted action on the application.

# Vulnerability Class:
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_>(CSRF)

# How to Reproduce: (POC):
Host the attached code in a webserver. Then send the link to the application user. The user should be logged in when he
clicks on the link.
You can entice him to do that by using social engineering techniques.
i.e. Log into the application and click the following link to get free licenses
