Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-18631:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a failure to properly sanitize user-provided input within the Zimbra web client, specifically related to a feature called "Defanger", leading to a persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Malicious JavaScript code can be injected and permanently stored within the application, affecting other users who view the injected content.
- Improper Input Sanitization: User-provided input is not being sufficiently sanitized or validated before being stored and displayed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact is the ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's session. This can lead to:
  - Account takeover: An attacker could steal session cookies or credentials.
  - Data theft: An attacker could access and exfiltrate sensitive information within the user's account.
  - Phishing: An attacker could redirect users to malicious sites or display fraudulent content.
  - Other malicious actions: The injected script can perform any actions the logged-in user is allowed to perform.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the HTML web client.
- Attackers inject malicious code into an area of the web client that is not properly sanitized by the Defanger, so that the code is stored in the application.
- The stored script is then executed when other users access the affected feature in the web client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject data into the vulnerable component of the Zimbra web client.
- The injected script would execute when other users view the crafted content.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting).
- The vulnerability was reported by Netragard.
- The bug report indicates that a fix was included in the following patches:
    - ZCS 8.8.9 Patch 7
    - ZCS 8.8.10 Patch 2
    - ZCS 8.7.11 Patch 7
- The CVSS score is 5.0.
