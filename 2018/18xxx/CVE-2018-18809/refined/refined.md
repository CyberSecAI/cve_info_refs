{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `reportresource/reportresource/` service within Tibco JasperSoft, specifically in the `resource` parameter. The application attempts to restrict access by requiring the `resource` parameter to start with `net/sf/jasperreports/`. However, this prefix check is insufficient to prevent path traversal attacks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Path Traversal vulnerability due to insufficient input validation.",
       "Inadequate input sanitization in the `resource` parameter."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to access and read arbitrary files and directories on the server. This includes potentially sensitive information such as configuration files, which could contain database credentials or other confidential data.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP request to the `reportresource/reportresource/` service, where the `resource` parameter includes path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to navigate outside the intended directory.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need authentication or specific privileges. The attack can be launched remotely over the network."
  }
