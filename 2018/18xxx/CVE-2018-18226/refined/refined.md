CVE-2018-18226:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: The Steam IHS Discovery dissector in Wireshark could consume excessive system memory due to improper memory management.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:  Improper memory management leading to excessive memory consumption.
  - Impact of exploitation:  An attacker could cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by exhausting system memory, potentially leading to a crash.
  - Attack vectors: Network traffic analysis: An attacker can inject a malformed packet onto the network, or provide a malicious capture file.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker with the ability to inject malformed packets into a network or provide a malicious packet capture file.

CVE-2018-18227:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: The MS-WSP protocol dissector in Wireshark had a flaw in handling NULL return values, which could lead to a crash.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities: Improper handling of NULL return values in the dissector leading to a potential crash.
  - Impact of exploitation: An attacker could cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by triggering a crash in Wireshark through crafted network packets or a malicious trace file.
  - Attack vectors: Network traffic analysis: An attacker can inject specially crafted network packets, or provide a malicious capture file.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker with the ability to inject malformed packets into a network or provide a malicious packet capture file.
 
CVE-2018-19622:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: The MMSE dissector in Wireshark could enter an infinite loop due to a length overflow.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:  Length overflow leading to an infinite loop.
  - Impact of exploitation: An attacker could cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by triggering an infinite loop in Wireshark, resulting in a hang or crash.
  - Attack vectors: Network traffic analysis: An attacker can inject a malformed packet onto the wire or trick someone to open a malicious packet trace file.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker with the ability to inject malformed packets into a network or provide a malicious packet capture file.

CVE-2018-16058:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: The Bluetooth AVDTP dissector in Wireshark could crash due to improperly initialized data structure.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:  Improperly initialized data structures can cause crashes.
  - Impact of exploitation: An attacker could cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by triggering a crash in Wireshark through crafted Bluetooth packets or a malicious trace file.
  - Attack vectors: Network traffic analysis: An attacker can inject specially crafted Bluetooth AVDTP packets, or provide a malicious capture file.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker with the ability to inject malformed packets into a network or provide a malicious packet capture file.
 
CVE-2018-19623:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: The LBMPDM dissector in Wireshark could crash and also write arbitrary data to memory locations if certain negative values were not correctly handled.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities: Improper validation of input values, leading to potential memory corruption and DoS
  - Impact of exploitation: An attacker could cause a denial-of-service (DoS) and potentially execute arbitrary code by exploiting a flaw in the LBMPDM dissector.
  - Attack vectors: Network traffic analysis: An attacker can inject specially crafted LBMPDM packets, or provide a malicious capture file.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker with the ability to inject malformed packets into a network or provide a malicious packet capture file.
