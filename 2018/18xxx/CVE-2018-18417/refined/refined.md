  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it back to the user.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Input fields such as 'name', 'address', 'short_note', and filename in the file upload feature are vulnerable.",

  "Attack vectors": "HTTP POST request to the '/demo/ekushey/index.php/admin/client/create' endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to submit HTTP requests containing malicious JavaScript to the vulnerable endpoint. The attacker does not need any special privileges."
