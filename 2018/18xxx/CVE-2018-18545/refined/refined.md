Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the lack of sanitization of the `$_POST['name']` variable in the `dapur\apps\app_user\edit_user.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. This occurs because the user-supplied input from the `$_POST['name']` variable is stored in the application's database or persistent storage without proper sanitization, and then later displayed to other users without encoding.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Code Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will execute in the context of a victim's browser when the malicious data is rendered.
- **Session Hijacking:** Attackers could potentially steal user cookies or other sensitive information, leading to session hijacking.
- **Defacement:** The attacker can modify the user interface of the application to display misleading information or even deface the website.
- **Redirection:** The attacker could redirect users to a phishing website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a malicious payload through the `$_POST['name']` variable using an HTTP POST request when editing a user profile.
- **Browser Execution:** When a victim views the user profiles, the malicious JavaScript is loaded and executed by the browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Edit User Profile:** An attacker needs to have the ability to access and modify the user profile data, specifically the name field. This may require the attacker to have an authenticated user account with the required permissions, or to exploit another vulnerability to gain such access.
- **Understanding of the vulnerable parameters:** An attacker needs to identify the vulnerable `$_POST['name']` parameter in `dapur\apps\app_user\edit_user.php`.

**Additional Notes:**

The provided images in the issue report illustrate a successful XSS injection using `<script>alert(1)</script>` as the user's name. This confirms the vulnerability described.
