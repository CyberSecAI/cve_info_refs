- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The editor's source code view does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input, specifically allowing the injection of an IFRAME element with a `javascript:` URL.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser session. This can lead to a variety of malicious activities, such as:
  - Stealing cookies and session tokens.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Defacing the website.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors:** Injecting a malicious iframe tag (e.g., `<IFRAME SRC="javascript:alert('XSS');"></IFRAME>`) into the source code view of the editor.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the editor's source code view and have the ability to insert the malicious payload.
