The provided content contains an issue report from the py-evm project, which describes an unexpected behavior of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) implementation when executing a specific contract. This issue does not seem to directly relate to a security vulnerability described by a CVE.

Specifically, the reported issue concerns the EVM stack containing numerical values like 100 and 0, instead of the expected byte strings during contract execution. This leads to an invalid opcode and the termination of the execution.

Given that the content does not describe a security vulnerability and is only related to a bug in the EVM implementation, I will mark it as:

**UNRELATED**
