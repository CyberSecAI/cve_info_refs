## Description

[![@renardbebe](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25030553?u=9e2df18b07532108b79e17818568e11c5f922405&v=4&size=48)](/renardbebe)[renardbebe](https://github.com/renardbebe)opened [on Nov 1, 2018](https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1448#issue-376289807)

[Contract.zip](https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/files/2537684/Contract.zip)

### What is wrong?

* When we executing our contract via py-evm, we find there are strange values occur in stack, and they cause the execution ended in INVALID opcode.
* just run `vm.execute_bytecode()` with default settings, and the `code = decode_hex(our Contract)`
* output `computation._stack.values`: "stack": [100, 100, 0], the correct value should be byte str like b'\x'

Just want to ask if someone has already figured out this issue and what are the main concerns here. Thanks a lot.
