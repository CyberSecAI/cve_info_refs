Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-18798

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `id` parameter within the application's URL. Specifically, the application uses this parameter directly in SQL queries without adequate validation or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
  - **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By injecting malicious SQL code through the `id` parameter, an attacker can manipulate database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
  - **Data Exposure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials, personal details, and other confidential data.
  - **Data Modification/Deletion:** The attacker can modify or delete existing data within the database, potentially disrupting the application's functionality or causing data corruption.
  - **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potentially):** In some cases, successful SQL injection could lead to the ability to execute arbitrary code on the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
  - **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through crafted HTTP GET requests to specific URLs, including:
     -  `/[PATH]/student/index.php?view=view&id=[SQL]`
     -  `/[PATH]/event/index.php?view=view&id=[SQL]`
     -  `/[PATH]/user/index.php?view=view&id=[SQL]`
  -  The `[SQL]` placeholder in the URLs indicates the position where malicious SQL code can be injected.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
  - **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate HTTP GET requests to inject malicious SQL code in the `id` parameter.
  - **Knowledge of SQL syntax:** The attacker requires knowledge of SQL syntax to craft malicious SQL injection payloads.
