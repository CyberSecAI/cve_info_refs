Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-18504:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free condition. Specifically, a texture client buffer is freed while still being used during graphics operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-after-free: The primary issue is that a memory buffer (texture client buffer) is deallocated while a reference to it is still active and being used.
- Out-of-bounds read: The use of a freed buffer leads to an out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Crash: The vulnerability leads to a potentially exploitable crash due to accessing freed memory.
- Memory corruption: By reading from a freed buffer, the attacker can read potentially sensitive information, and depending on the circumstances might be able to overwrite parts of the memory, which can then lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious websites: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by tricking a user into visiting a specially crafted webpage that triggers the described scenario during graphics operations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a web page that can execute Javascript that causes the described vulnerability to occur.
- The attacker needs to be able to serve this web page to a victim using a vulnerable version of Firefox.

The information provided gives more detail than the official CVE description. It specifies that it is a texture client buffer that is freed, describes the out-of-bounds read and confirms the possibility of exploitation through a malicious website.
