    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the `mintToken` function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The `mintToken` function allows the owner to arbitrarily increase the balance of any address, leading to an integer overflow vulnerability.",
	  "The total supply is not updated when `mintToken` is called, leading to inconsistency and allowing more tokens to be created than intended"
    ],
    "impact": "The integer overflow in `mintToken` can be exploited by the owner to mint an extremely large amount of tokens, which wraps around to a smaller value. This can effectively allow the contract owner to drain all funds from the smart contract, and may also result in the balance of some accounts being set to 0",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The contract owner calls the vulnerable `mintToken` function with a large `mintedAmount`."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be the contract owner to execute the `mintToken` function."
