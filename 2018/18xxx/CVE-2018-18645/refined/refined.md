{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Unsubscribe links in GitLab emails were not properly secured, allowing them to be accessed and used without authentication.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The unsubscribe links included in emails were not protected and could be used by anyone who had access to the email, even if they were not logged into GitLab.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could unsubscribe a user from notifications without requiring authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker could intercept or gain access to emails containing unsubscribe links and use them to unsubscribe the intended user.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs access to the victim's email containing the unsubscribe link, but does not require a GitLab login or any other special permissions."
