Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-18472:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the language change and modify functionality within the REST API of WD My Book Live devices. Specifically, the `configuration` endpoint is vulnerable to command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated Remote Command Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the device as root without needing to authenticate.
*   **Command Injection:** By injecting commands into the `bim` parameter of a GET request to `/panel/rest/configuration`, an attacker can execute them on the device.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete System Compromise:** Attackers can gain full control of the affected device due to root-level command execution.
*   **Data Manipulation:** They can read, add, remove, or modify data stored on the NAS device.
*   **Malware Installation:** Attackers can install malicious software (e.g., trojans) on the device.
*   **Device Manipulation:** They can manipulate device configurations and settings.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Requests:** Exploitation is done by sending crafted HTTP GET requests to the `/panel/rest/configuration` endpoint.
*   **`bim` Parameter:** The malicious commands are injected into the `bim` parameter of the GET request.
*   **Network Accessibility:** The device needs to be accessible over the network (potentially through port forwarding).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable WD My Book Live device.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of crafting HTTP GET requests.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No user credentials or prior authentication is required for successful exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects WD My Book Live and some models of WD MyCloud NAS devices.
*   The vulnerability is present in devices introduced between 2010 and 2012, which have been discontinued since 2014.
*   Western Digital has stated that these legacy products are no longer supported.
*   The Wizcase article mentions that there are nearly 2 million affected devices online.
*   The provided content also discusses another vulnerability, CVE-2018-18471, affecting multiple NAS devices using Axentra Hipserv firmware, but this is not the focus of CVE-2018-18472.
