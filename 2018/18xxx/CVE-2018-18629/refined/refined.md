{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `keybase-redirector` binary, which runs with setuid root permissions, used the `fusermount` binary to create the `/keybase` mountpoint. It did not specify an absolute path to `fusermount` or clear the environment when executing it via the `exec.Command` function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of a relative path to execute a binary in a privileged context.",
      "Failure to sanitize the PATH environment variable."
    ],
    "impact": "A local, low-privileged user can achieve arbitrary code execution as root.",
    "attack_vectors": "By creating a malicious `fusermount` executable and modifying the `$PATH` environment variable to point to it before executing `keybase-redirector`, a low-privileged user can trick the setuid binary to execute the malicious `fusermount` with root permissions.",
    "required_capabilities": "Local access as a low-privileged user with the ability to modify the PATH environment variable and create executables in directories the user controls."
