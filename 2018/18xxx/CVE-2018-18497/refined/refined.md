{
  "CVE-2018-18497": {
    "Description": "Limitations on the URIs allowed to WebExtensions by the `browser.windows.create` API can be bypassed when a pipe in the URL field is used within the extension to load multiple pages as a single argument. This could allow a malicious WebExtension to opened privileged `about:` or `file:` locations.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `browser.windows.create` API incorrectly splits URLs by the pipe character `|`, allowing an attacker to bypass the allowed schemes for this API by combining multiple URLs with pipes in between. ",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper input validation of URLs passed to `browser.windows.create` API",
      "Incorrect splitting of the URL string using the pipe `|` character"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious web extension could load arbitrary URLs, such as `file:` or `about:` pages, which are normally restricted, leading to potential privilege escalation or other unwanted behaviors.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious web extension would call the `browser.windows.create` API with a specially crafted URL containing pipe characters to bypass restrictions and load privileged URLs.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to create and publish a malicious web extension to exploit this vulnerability. The user must install this extension for the exploit to work."
