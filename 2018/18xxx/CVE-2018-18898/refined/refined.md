Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-18898:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper parsing of email addresses within the `Email-Address-List` Perl module. Specifically, it is due to an algorithmic complexity issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Algorithmic Complexity Vulnerability: The core issue lies in how the module parses email addresses, leading to excessive resource consumption when processing specially crafted, complex email data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service condition by sending specially crafted email data that causes the vulnerable module to consume excessive resources, eventually crashing or becoming unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote Attack: The attack is launched remotely.
- Email Data: The attack is delivered via email data, particularly within the headers that the `Email-Address-List` module processes, such as From, To, Cc, Bcc, Reply-To, Sender and Resent-* headers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send email data to a system using the vulnerable software
- Crafted Email Data: The attacker needs to be able to create email data that triggers the algorithmic complexity vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `libemail-address-list-perl` package.
- Patches were released to address the vulnerability (e.g. version 0.06 of the perl module, and corresponding package updates on Fedora, Debian and Ubuntu).
- The issue has been addressed in various Linux distributions including Ubuntu (USN-4517-1), Debian (DLA 2101-1), and Fedora (FEDORA-2019-73cbc02e14 and FEDORA-2019-ef5551fcff).
