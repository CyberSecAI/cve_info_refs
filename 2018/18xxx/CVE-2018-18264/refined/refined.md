{
  "CVE-2018-18264": {
    "root_cause": "The Kubernetes Dashboard, prior to version 1.10.1, allowed unauthenticated users to access resources using the Dashboard's service account, bypassing normal authentication mechanisms.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper authentication",
      "Privilege escalation"
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers could bypass authentication and use the Dashboard's service account to access secrets and other resources within the cluster, potentially leading to further compromise of the cluster and its applications. This included the ability to retrieve the `kubernetes-dashboard-certs` secret containing TLS certificate and private key.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network access to the Kubernetes Dashboard web interface."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needed network access to the Kubernetes Dashboard and the ability to use the 'skip' authentication button or manipulate cookies to bypass the login page.",
    "additional_details": [
      "The vulnerability existed because the Dashboard allowed users to skip the authentication process and the backend would initialize an insecure client using dashboard service account privileges.",
      "The fix involved disabling the 'skip' option by default and restricting access to the Dashboard service account to the backend only.",
      "The vulnerability was addressed in Kubernetes Dashboard version 1.10.1, which added a new flag `--enable-skip-login` and disabled the skip option on the login view by default.",
       "The issue was initially addressed in pull request #3289, which blocked unauthenticated access to secrets, and then further refined in pull request #3400.",
        "The fix required backend, frontend and build pipeline refactoring.",
        "The vulnerability could not be easily detected through standard Kubernetes audit logs because they only record actions performed by the service account itself, not if it was invoked from an unauthenticated session"
    ]
