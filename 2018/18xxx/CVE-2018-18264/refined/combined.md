### @floreks **[floreks](/floreks)** commented [Dec 7, 2018](#issue-388614874)

Fixes [#2672](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/issues/2672)

`Skip` option has been disabled by default and access to the Dashboard SA has been restricted to our backend only. In case user tries to send a request without auth info 401 error will be returned.

If user tries to "manually" skip login page by adding cookie in the frontend, every page that tries to access API server will look like that:

[![zrzut ekranu z 2018-12-07 11-13-13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2285385/49645042-c110d680-fa1a-11e8-92ba-53b5f7becf60.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2285385/49645042-c110d680-fa1a-11e8-92ba-53b5f7becf60.png)

Thanks to [#3077](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/pull/3077) most of the work has been already done.

Sorry, something went wrong.

the double negative makes this hard to follow... can the flag be changed to `--enable-skip-login` and default to false?

Sure we can but it also requires frontend and build pipeline refactoring. As `skip` option should be disabled by default then it is `argDisableSkip=true`.

not knowing how this method is used, does returning `nil,nil` mean the service account credentials are used instead?

if so, shouldn't the `if req == nil {` case above return an error?

I actually investigated our code to check if it would be possible that external request comes as nil, and it is not. `restful-go` will always initialize request object for us. The first `if req == nil` is used to initialize `insecureClient` (by insecure I mean client that uses dashboard SA privileges) that is used internally by our backend only and `return` at the end is there, not to break dashboard in case someone chooses to actually set `argDisableSkip` to `false`.

> I actually investigated our code to check if it would be possible that external request comes as nil, and it is not.

That may be true at this point in time, but a code path could be introduced that could call this with a nil internally as part of building a response to satisfy an external request.

> The first if req == nil is used to initialize insecureClient (by insecure I mean client that uses dashboard SA privileges) that is used internally by our backend only

I'd like to see the internal client building made more separate from the function that is used to return clients used to handle external requests, for safety

The current one is actually correct as we need skip button to be enabled in our dev environments and tests by default. Most of our UI functionality tests rely on dashboard SA privileges.

It only affects our `gulp serve`, `gulp serve:prod` and tasks that rely directly on them, so tests mostly.

So in case someone simply uses `gulp serve` skip option will be visible. To disable it user will have to provide a `enableSkipButton` parameter. `gulp serve --enableSkipButton=false`.

[@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt) I don't think so. They are used only for manual tests before creating a PR or to check the changes. Also, they do not deploy container in the cluster but rather start a dashboard process outside of the cluster.

this logic is extremely difficult to follow. can we do something like this as a first step to make sure this always returns true when skip login is not enabled?

```
if !args.Holder.GetEnableSkipLogin() {
  return true
}

```

It would have to be a bit different actually.

```
if self.isLoginEnabled(req) && !args.Holder.GetEnableSkipLogin() {
  return true
}
```

In case login option is completely disabled we can not block user out of Dashboard. First we have to make sure that it is enabled and then skip option has to be disabled. Bascially if we would split that then whole method would become:

```
func (self *clientManager) isSecureModeEnabled(req *restful.Request) bool {
	if self.isLoginEnabled(req) && !args.Holder.GetEnableSkipLogin() {
		return true
	}

	authInfo, _ := self.extractAuthInfo(req)
	return self.isLoginEnabled(req) && args.Holder.GetEnableSkipLogin() && authInfo != nil
}
```

It might be slightly easier to follow. [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt) WDYT?

that is simpler, but if I've configured the server to use TLS and not skip login, the incoming request shouldn't have any ability to make `isSecureModeEnabled` return `false`. Can we make the initial check only look at how the server was configured, not look at `req`?

It would make this method even more complicated as we have several arguments responsible for TLS mode. The easiest way is to check if `req.Request.TLS != nil`. If it is then we are sure that the request itself is secure.

There is no way to alter that from the outside. Only by corrupting `restful-go` used by dashboard someone would be able to somehow influence that.

Letting a characteristic of an incoming request control bypassing security seems like a bad idea when the intent to serve securely can be determined from the config options alone. I'd like to see that adjusted in the future.

| That's a good quick fix solution. Although I suggest two follow ups:   1. [@jessfraz](https://github.com/jessfraz) suggestion on unauthenticated when user sends no auth headers 2. Changing default config to that secrets are not visible at all. I believe that'd better approach than the current one which has exclude list. I believe we can do this easily and prevent similar bugs in the future.    WDYT? |

| [@jessfraz](https://github.com/jessfraz) suggestion on unauthenticated when user sends no auth headers  IMHO even if user is authenticated he should not have access to those dashboard exclusive resources. They are critical and all users should be blocked from viewing them. There is no point for users to actually view or modify them. They should be only accessible using `kubectl`. If we would follow this path then I guess "Unauthorized" is a correct error.  Changing default config to that secrets are not visible at all. I believe that'd better approach than the current one which has exclude list. I believe we can do this easily and prevent similar bugs in the future. WDYT?  In case user tries to use direct link to access the resource should we just show 404 resource not found error? This could be a bit misleading as `kubectl get secret xxx` would still return it correctly. |

| [@maciaszczykm](https://github.com/maciaszczykm) when there is no auth token it does not mean that no one is authenticated. It means that user is authenticated as the Dashboard user. Only in case where `Skip` option is disabled we should always redirect to the login page if user has not logged in. |

this method is basically "allow by default", with a list of specific exclusions. it is vulnerable to drifting from the actual permissions granted to the dashboard service account. I'd strongly recommend supporting a mode that requires user login and never allows dashboard users to make use of dashboard service account API permissions.

We have to think how to achieve that as we have to support an alternative option also where our login mechanism is disabled and user relies on authentication header or dashboard privileges to use it.

| I would never want this behavior in a dashboard deployment I was responsible for. What can we do to enable requiring user login and prevent any possibility of use of the dashboard credentials via web requests to the dashboard?  We should first disable `Skip` option by default and not allow access to any views except login in case user has not logged in. This should be easy to do if login mechanism is enabled. |

| It's merged as a quick fix. We have to investigate how to disable skipping auth, so no one will be able to enter any other page than login if he is not authenticated already. |

| [@jessfraz](https://github.com/jessfraz) do you perhaps know someone who could contribute the change? Seems like either we do with showing no secrets at all or disabling the "skip" option. Both of them sound like deleting code. |

### @floreks **[floreks](/floreks)** commented [Dec 7, 2018](#issue-388614874)

Fixes [#2672](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/issues/2672)

`Skip` option has been disabled by default and access to the Dashboard SA has been restricted to our backend only. In case user tries to send a request without auth info 401 error will be returned.

If user tries to "manually" skip login page by adding cookie in the frontend, every page that tries to access API server will look like that:

[![zrzut ekranu z 2018-12-07 11-13-13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2285385/49645042-c110d680-fa1a-11e8-92ba-53b5f7becf60.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2285385/49645042-c110d680-fa1a-11e8-92ba-53b5f7becf60.png)

Thanks to [#3077](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/pull/3077) most of the work has been already done.

Sorry, something went wrong.

the double negative makes this hard to follow... can the flag be changed to `--enable-skip-login` and default to false?

Sure we can but it also requires frontend and build pipeline refactoring. As `skip` option should be disabled by default then it is `argDisableSkip=true`.

not knowing how this method is used, does returning `nil,nil` mean the service account credentials are used instead?

if so, shouldn't the `if req == nil {` case above return an error?

I actually investigated our code to check if it would be possible that external request comes as nil, and it is not. `restful-go` will always initialize request object for us. The first `if req == nil` is used to initialize `insecureClient` (by insecure I mean client that uses dashboard SA privileges) that is used internally by our backend only and `return` at the end is there, not to break dashboard in case someone chooses to actually set `argDisableSkip` to `false`.

> I actually investigated our code to check if it would be possible that external request comes as nil, and it is not.

That may be true at this point in time, but a code path could be introduced that could call this with a nil internally as part of building a response to satisfy an external request.

> The first if req == nil is used to initialize insecureClient (by insecure I mean client that uses dashboard SA privileges) that is used internally by our backend only

I'd like to see the internal client building made more separate from the function that is used to return clients used to handle external requests, for safety

The current one is actually correct as we need skip button to be enabled in our dev environments and tests by default. Most of our UI functionality tests rely on dashboard SA privileges.

It only affects our `gulp serve`, `gulp serve:prod` and tasks that rely directly on them, so tests mostly.

So in case someone simply uses `gulp serve` skip option will be visible. To disable it user will have to provide a `enableSkipButton` parameter. `gulp serve --enableSkipButton=false`.

[@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt) I don't think so. They are used only for manual tests before creating a PR or to check the changes. Also, they do not deploy container in the cluster but rather start a dashboard process outside of the cluster.

this logic is extremely difficult to follow. can we do something like this as a first step to make sure this always returns true when skip login is not enabled?

```
if !args.Holder.GetEnableSkipLogin() {
  return true
}

```

It would have to be a bit different actually.

```
if self.isLoginEnabled(req) && !args.Holder.GetEnableSkipLogin() {
  return true
}
```

In case login option is completely disabled we can not block user out of Dashboard. First we have to make sure that it is enabled and then skip option has to be disabled. Bascially if we would split that then whole method would become:

```
func (self *clientManager) isSecureModeEnabled(req *restful.Request) bool {
	if self.isLoginEnabled(req) && !args.Holder.GetEnableSkipLogin() {
		return true
	}

	authInfo, _ := self.extractAuthInfo(req)
	return self.isLoginEnabled(req) && args.Holder.GetEnableSkipLogin() && authInfo != nil
}
```

It might be slightly easier to follow. [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt) WDYT?

that is simpler, but if I've configured the server to use TLS and not skip login, the incoming request shouldn't have any ability to make `isSecureModeEnabled` return `false`. Can we make the initial check only look at how the server was configured, not look at `req`?

It would make this method even more complicated as we have several arguments responsible for TLS mode. The easiest way is to check if `req.Request.TLS != nil`. If it is then we are sure that the request itself is secure.

There is no way to alter that from the outside. Only by corrupting `restful-go` used by dashboard someone would be able to somehow influence that.

Letting a characteristic of an incoming request control bypassing security seems like a bad idea when the intent to serve securely can be determined from the config options alone. I'd like to see that adjusted in the future.

# CVE-2018-18264 Privilege escalation through Kubernetes dashboard

A recently disclosed vulnerability in Kubernetes dashboard (CVE-2018-18264) exposes secrets to unauthenticated users. In this blog post we’ll explore some key takeaways regarding monitoring privilege escalation on Kubernetes.

## Kubernetes dashboard CVE-2018-18264 overview

The [Kubernetes dashboard](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard) is a web based user interface that allows users to manage applications and resources within the cluster. This service has a login functionality starting from Kubernetes 1.7.0. Since then, users are able to authenticate with a kubeconfig file or an access token. But it is also possible to skip the authentication altogether with a *skip button*.

[![Kubernetes dashboard vulnerability CVE-2018-18264 ](https://sysdig.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/kubernetes_dashboard_login.png)](https://sysdig.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/kubernetes_dashboard_login.png)

The recently disclosed vulnerability in Kubernetes dashboard: [CVE-2018-18264](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-18264) allows users to escalate privileges within the Kubernetes cluster using the dashboard to potentially access information they are not actually granted access to: a user could skip the authentication and query resources that the dashboard service account has access to, like the `kubernetes-dashboard-certs` secret, that stores TLS certificate and private key for the service.

This is particularly critical because with those TLS credentials, the attacker could impersonate the dashboard service, spawning a fake service to steal other user’s credentials.

Kubernetes dashboard v1.10.1 was released to address this vulnerability, [this is the announcement email](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/kubernetes-announce/CVE-2018-18264%7Csort:date/kubernetes-announce/yBrFf5nmvfI/gUO60KIlCAAJ) and see PRs #[3289](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/pull/3289) and #[3400](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/pull/3400) for details.

Skipping authentication and using the service account credentials is an unusual behavior and this vulnerability should raise concerns on how these actions can go unnoticed by monitoring and security tools.

## Privilege escalation as seen by Kubernetes Audit

The [Kubernetes Audit Policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/audit/) is a new feature that allows the Kubernetes API server to generate logs regarding API calls. This allows to answer in detail the question of *who* requested *what* within the Kubernetes cluster. At first sight, It seems the right tool to chase an attacker who has retrieved a cluster secret exploiting this vulnerability.

Let’s try to reproduce the attack, and see if that’s the case.

By using an unpatched version of the Kubernetes dashboard, we’re able to hit the skip button and paste the request for a secret, in this case the `kubernetes-dashboard-certs`, which resides at`/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/secrets/kubernetes-dashboard-certs`.

If we inspect the Kubernetes audit events logs generated in the described scenario, here’s what we would see:

```

From the Kubernetes API server, the request is coming from the cluster IP 172.17.0.4, corresponding to the Kubernetes dashboard, and the *user* field is populated using the default kube-system’s Service Account (i.e. `system:serviceaccount:kube-system:default`).

It’s clear that there’s no additional information regarding the fact that this request is forwarded from an unauthenticated session. In fact, in the current Kubernetes implementation, the Kubernetes dashboard access the resource on behalf of the user. This means that the authorization is performed by the Kubernetes dashboard, before the request is issued to the Kubernetes API server.

We can also notice that a very similar audit log will appear every time a Kubernetes dashboard container is deployed. Indeed, during the startup phase, the`kubernetes-dashboard-certs` is fetched and then stored in memory.

## How to detect Kubernetes privilege escalation security attacks

This vulnerability has been very promptly patched, just make sure you’re running Kubernetes dashboard v1.10.1, where the skip login has also been disabled by default. Still concerns should be raised regarding the possibility that new exploits of this kind would not be easily detectable.

As matter of fact, these kind of privilege escalation exploits can be very hard to detect, as the single event is rightly authorized by the Kubernetes API server, despite being forwarded on behalf of an unauthorized user.

A good practice might be to always monitor the activities around critical resources like secrets.

Starting from release version 0.13.0, [Sysdig Falco](https://sysdig.com/opensource/falco/) supports [Kubernetes Audit Event stream](https://sysdig.com/blog/falco-0-13-released-kubernetes-audit-support/). This means that you can create rules that trigger notifications whenever there’s an access to a given resource.

For instance, to detect a possible exploit of CVE-2018-18264, we could use Falco to fire an alert when there is an access to the `kubernetes-dashboard-certs` secret. The Falco rule would look like this:

```
- macro: secrets
  condition: (ka.target.resource=secrets)

- rule: Access to Kubernetes Dashboard Certificate
  desc: Match all access to secret kubernetes-dashboard-certs
  condition: secrets and ka.uri=/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/secrets/kubernetes-dashboard-certs
  output: K8s Audit Event received (user=%ka.user.name verb=%ka.verb uri=%ka.uri obj=%jevt.obj)
  priority: DEBUG
  source: k8s_audit
  tags: [k8s]
Code language: JavaScript (javascript)
```

Remember that in order to make this work you also need to [configure your audit policy](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/blob/dev/examples/k8s_audit_config/README.md) file to generate audit events on the namespace and resources that we might be interested in, like this:

```
apiVersion: audit.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Policy
rules:
  - level: Metadata
    resources:
    - group: ""
      resources: ["secrets"]
      resourceName: ["kubernetes-dashboard-certs"]
      namespace: ["kube-system"]
Code language: JavaScript (javascript)
```

The Kubernetes dashboard generally requests the certificate once at boot. You might be interested in auditing Kubernetes dashboard creation as well, and by correlating both events you would be able to infer that the certificate request is legitimately requested by the pod upon startup. Otherwise, if you start seeing accesses to the `kubernetes-dashboard-certs` without any other events you can relate, you might want to perform some troubleshooting in search for privilege escalations.

Although given the current resource and identity access management, it is not possible to determine deterministically whether a credential retrieval is due to the CVE exploit, [runtime security](https://sysdig.com/use-cases/cloud-threat-detection-and-response/) can identify and alert privilege escalation attempts like the one we have just seen.

Kubernetes privilege escalation attacks can be also detected with [Sysdig Secure](https://sysdig.com/products/secure/). Leveraging Falco rule language, you can define runtime security policies and apply them to different Kubernetes scopes, either using the UI or [as code](https://sysdig.com/blog/using-terraform-for-container-security-as-code/).

[![Privilege escalation alert on Sysdig Secure](https://sysdig.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/privilege_escalation_alert_sysdig_secure-1170x575.png)](https://sysdig.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/privilege_escalation_alert_sysdig_secure.png)
## Conclusions

Detecting privilege escalation exploits like this one can be very hard because an event which is authorized by the Kubernetes API server but actually comes from an unauthorized user.

Making use of the Kubernetes Audit functionality, Falco and Sysdig Secure can be used to monitor and alert on anomalous behavior and catch privilege escalation attacks and other [Kubernetes security](https://sysdig.com/learn-cloud-native/kubernetes-security/kubernetes-security-101/) threats.

# Production-Grade Container Orchestration

[Learn Kubernetes Basics](/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/)
![](/_common-resources/images/flower.svg)

[Kubernetes](/docs/concepts/overview/), also known as K8s, is an open source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery. Kubernetes builds upon [15 years of experience of running production workloads at Google](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2898444), combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.

![](/_common-resources/images/scalable.svg)
#### Planet Scale

Designed on the same principles that allow Google to run billions of containers a week, Kubernetes can scale without increasing your operations team.

![](/_common-resources/images/blocks.svg)
#### Never Outgrow

Whether testing locally or running a global enterprise, Kubernetes flexibility grows with you to deliver your applications consistently and easily no matter how complex your need is.

![](/_common-resources/images/suitcase.svg)
#### Run K8s Anywhere

Kubernetes is open source giving you the freedom to take advantage of on-premises, hybrid, or public cloud infrastructure, letting you effortlessly move workloads to where it matters to you.

## Kubernetes Features

### [Automated rollouts and rollbacks](/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/)

Kubernetes progressively rolls out changes to your application or its configuration, while monitoring application health to ensure it doesn't kill all your instances at the same time. If something goes wrong, Kubernetes will rollback the change for you. Take advantage of a growing ecosystem of deployment solutions.
### [Service discovery and load balancing](/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/)

No need to modify your application to use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism. Kubernetes gives Pods their own IP addresses and a single DNS name for a set of Pods, and can load-balance across them.
### [Storage orchestration](/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/)

Automatically mount the storage system of your choice, whether from local storage, a public cloud provider, or a network storage system such as iSCSI or NFS.
### [Self-healing](/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/#how-a-replicaset-works)

Restarts containers that fail, replaces and reschedules containers when nodes die, kills containers that don't respond to your user-defined health check, and doesn't advertise them to clients until they are ready to serve.
### [Secret and configuration management](/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/)

Deploy and update Secrets and application configuration without rebuilding your image and without exposing Secrets in your stack configuration.
### [Automatic bin packing](/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/)

Automatically places containers based on their resource requirements and other constraints, while not sacrificing availability. Mix critical and best-effort workloads in order to drive up utilization and save even more resources.
### [Batch execution](/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/)

In addition to services, Kubernetes can manage your batch and CI workloads, replacing containers that fail, if desired.
### [Horizontal scaling](/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/)

Scale your application up and down with a simple command, with a UI, or automatically based on CPU usage.
### [IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack](/docs/concepts/services-networking/dual-stack/)

Allocation of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to Pods and Services
### [Designed for extensibility](/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/)

Add features to your Kubernetes cluster without changing upstream source code.

## Introduction

Kubernetes Dashboard is a general purpose, web-based UI for Kubernetes clusters. It allows users to manage applications running in the cluster and troubleshoot them, as well as manage the cluster itself.

As of version 7.0.0, we have dropped support for Manifest-based installation. Only Helm-based installation is supported now. Due to multi-container setup and hard dependency on Kong gateway API proxy
it would not be feasible to easily support Manifest-based installation.

Additionally, we have changed the versioning scheme and dropped `appVersion` from Helm chart. It is because, with a multi-container setup, every module is now versioned separately. Helm chart version
can be considered an app version now.

## Installation

Kubernetes Dashboard supports only Helm-based installation currently as it is faster and gives us better control
over all dependencies required by Dashboard to run. We now use a single-container, DBless [Kong](https://hub.docker.com/r/kong/kong-gateway) installation
as a gateway that connects all our containers and exposes the UI. Users can then use any ingress controller or proxy
in front of kong gateway. To find out more about ways to customize your installation check out [helm chart values](/kubernetes/dashboard/blob/master/charts/kubernetes-dashboard/values.yaml).

In order to install Kubernetes Dashboard simply run:

```
# Add kubernetes-dashboard repository
helm repo add kubernetes-dashboard https://kubernetes.github.io/dashboard/
# Deploy a Helm Release named "kubernetes-dashboard" using the kubernetes-dashboard chart
helm upgrade --install kubernetes-dashboard kubernetes-dashboard/kubernetes-dashboard --create-namespace --namespace kubernetes-dashboard
```

For more information about our Helm chart visit [ArtifactHub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/k8s-dashboard/kubernetes-dashboard).
