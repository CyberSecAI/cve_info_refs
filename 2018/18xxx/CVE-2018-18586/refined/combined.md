# CVE-2018-18586

| **Name** | CVE-2018-18586 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | chmextract.c in the chmextract sample program, as distributed with libmspack before 0.8alpha, does not protect against absolute/relative pathnames in CHM files, leading to Directory Traversal. NOTE: the vendor disputes that this is a libmspack vulnerability, because chmextract.c was only intended as a source-code example, not a supported application |

## Notes

```
<https://github.com/kyz/libmspack/commit/7cadd489698be117c47efcadd742651594429e6d>
<https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2018/10/22/1>
src/chmextract.c was renamed from originally test/chmx.c
This sample code is not installed into the binary packages and was as well
never the idea to use it in "productised" binaries, but rather just simple
examples of the library use.

Subject: Buffer overflow in cabextract/libmspack (Fwd: New cabextract 1.8
 and libmspack 0.8 release)

New cabextract and libmspack fix a buffer overflow.
Notably libmspack is also used in clamav.

Forwarding the release notes here:

--------------------------

Hello all,

cabextract 1.8 has been released. It greatly improves its ability to
extract damaged files with the "-f" option, and the cabinfo command has
been rewritten.

It also fixes this bug:

* if a CAB file has a Quantum-compressed datablock with exactly 38912
compressed bytes, cabextract will write exactly one byte beyond its
input buffer.

cabextract can be downloaded from <https://www.cabextract.org.uk/>

cabextract-1.8.tar.gz

libmspack 0.8alpha has also been released.

It adds the new parameter MSCABD_PARAM_SALVAGE which permits salvaging
badly damaged files rather than rejecting them outright.

It fixes several bugs:

* the above 38912-byte Quantum CAB block bug
* libmspack now also rejects blank CHM filenames that are blank because
they have embedded null bytes, not just because they are zero-length
* chmextract now protects you from absolute/relative pathnames in CHM
  files

libmspack can be downloaded from
<https://www.cabextract.org.uk/libmspack/>

If you wish to patch an older version, please look at commits |8759da8,
||7cadd48 and ||40ef1b4 in the git repository.|

| [Description](#c0)  Matt Beland    2002-02-12 00:04:09 UTC  ``` During the initial bootstrap, Gentoo downloads the packages for various applications (including glibc, gcc, binutils, gettext, etc.) using a "generic" make.conf rather than the customized make.conf created by the user. As was illustrated during the recent ibiblio outage, this means that the use of mirrors is impossible during initial installations. While a minor annoyance for single-system installations affected by rare outages, it could be a substantial problem for larger installations intending to run installations from a local mirror.  Suggested fix: Download the packages required for bootstrap.sh before switching the custom make.conf for the generic one. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Daniel Robbins (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-12 17:49:38 UTC  ``` This should now be fixed. ``` |  |

## Description

\*\* DISPUTED \*\* chmextract.c in the chmextract sample program, as distributed with libmspack before 0.8alpha, does not protect against absolute/relative pathnames in CHM files, leading to Directory Traversal. NOTE: the vendor disputes that this is a libmspack vulnerability, because chmextract.c was only intended as a source-code example, not a supported application.

Hi

From <https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2018/10/22/1>

> chmextract now protects you from absolute/relative pathnames in CHM
> files

this is only for sample code on how to use the library and not
installed into the binary packages. But still tracking the affected
source and possible later source fix.

The fix is at
<https://github.com/kyz/libmspack/commit/7cadd489698be117c47efcadd742651594429e6d>
.

Regards,
Salvatore

|  |  | \* src/chmextract.c: add anti "../" and leading slash protection to |
|  |  | chmextract. I'm not pleased about this. All the sample code provided |
|  |  | with libmspack is meant to be simple examples of library use, not |
|  |  | "productised" binaries. Making the "useful" code samples install |
|  |  | as binaries was a mistake. They were never intended to protect you |
|  |  | from unpacking archive files with relative/absolute paths, and I |
|  |  | would prefer that they never will be. |

# Managing disruptive comments

You can hide, edit, or delete comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

## [Hiding a comment](#hiding-a-comment)

Organization moderators, and anyone with write access to a repository, can hide comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

If a comment is off-topic, outdated, or resolved, you may want to hide a comment to keep a discussion focused or make a pull request easier to navigate and review. Hidden comments are minimized but people with read access to the repository can expand them.

![Screenshot of a hidden comment. The only visible content is "This comment has been minimized", with a button to show the comment.](/assets/cb-13766/images/help/repository/hidden-comment.png)

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to hide.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Hide**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Hide" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42438/images/help/repository/comment-menu-hide.png)
3. Using the "Choose a reason" dropdown menu, choose a reason to hide the comment. Then select **Hide comment**.

   ![Screenshot of a comment showing a menu to select a reason to hide the comment: Spam, Abuse, Off Topic, Outdated, Duplicate, or Resolved.](/assets/cb-67538/images/help/repository/choose-reason-for-hiding-comment.png)

## [Unhiding a comment](#unhiding-a-comment)

Organization moderators, and anyone with write access to a repository, can unhide comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to unhide.
2. On the right side of the comment, click  **Show comment**.
3. On the right side of the expanded comment, select the  dropdown menu, then click **Unhide**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment marked as spam. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Unhide" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-50118/images/help/repository/comment-menu-hidden.png)

## [Editing a comment](#editing-a-comment)

Anyone with write access to a repository can edit comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

It's appropriate to edit a comment and remove content that doesn't contribute to the conversation and violates your community's code of conduct or GitHub's [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

Sometimes it may make sense to clearly indicate edits and their justification.

That said, anyone with read access to a repository can view a comment's edit history. The **edited** dropdown at the top of the comment contains a history of edits showing the user and timestamp for each edit.

![Screenshot of a comment by octo-user, which is partially redacted. In the header, next to "edited by octocat", a dropdown icon is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42069/images/help/repository/content-redacted-comment.png)

## [Redacting sensitive information](#redacting-sensitive-information)

Comment authors and anyone with write access to a repository can also delete sensitive information from a comment's edit history. For more information, see [Tracking changes in a comment](/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/tracking-changes-in-a-comment).

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to edit.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Edit**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Edit" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42473/images/help/repository/comment-menu-edit.png)
3. In the comment window, delete the content you'd like to remove, then type `[REDACTED]` to replace it.
4. At the bottom of the comment, type a note indicating that you have edited the comment, and optionally, why you edited the comment.
5. Click **Update comment**.

## [Deleting a comment](#deleting-a-comment)

Anyone with write access to a repository can delete comments on issues, pull requests, and commits. Organization owners, team maintainers, and the comment author can also delete a comment on a team page.

If a comment contains some constructive content that adds to the conversation in the issue or pull request, you can edit the comment instead.

Deleting a comment is your last resort as a moderator. It's appropriate to delete a comment if the entire comment adds no constructive content to a conversation and violates your community's code of conduct or GitHub's [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

Deleting a comment creates a timeline event that is visible to anyone with read access to the repository. However, the username of the person who deleted the comment is only visible to people with write access to the repository. For anyone without write access, the timeline event is anonymized.

![Screenshot of a timeline event, which says "octo-org deleted a comment from hubot 6 minutes ago."](/assets/cb-10760/images/help/issues/anonymized-timeline-entry-for-deleted-comment.png)

Note

The initial comment (or body) of an issue or pull request can't be deleted. Instead, you can edit issue and pull request bodies to remove unwanted content.
