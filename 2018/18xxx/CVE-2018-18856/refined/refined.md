Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-18856:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The LiquidVPN helper tool for macOS, `com.smr.liquidvpn.OVPNHelper`, implements an XPC service that does not properly filter incoming messages. This allows local attackers to send arbitrary XPC messages to the service. Specifically, when the "openvpn" parameter exists, the "openvpncmd" parameter is extracted and passed directly to a `system()` call without sanitization.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary OS commands due to the lack of input sanitization. Specifically, the "openvpncmd" parameter from an XPC message is passed unsanitized to the `system()` function.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Because the `com.smr.liquidvpn.OVPNHelper` runs with root privileges, any command executed via this vulnerability will also run with root privileges.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands with root privileges, leading to complete system compromise.
- **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain full control of the affected macOS system.

**4. Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the macOS system.
- **XPC Messaging:** The attacker crafts a malicious XPC message and sends it to the vulnerable XPC service `com.smr.liquidvpn.OVPNHelper`.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** An attacker needs to be a local user on the vulnerable macOS system.
- **Ability to Craft XPC Messages:** The attacker must be capable of crafting XPC messages to send to the vulnerable service.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability, CVE-2018-18856, is a privilege escalation vulnerability that stems from a command injection flaw in the LiquidVPN macOS client. The application's helper tool improperly handles the "openvpncmd" parameter from XPC messages, which is then passed unsanitized to the `system()` function, allowing local attackers to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges.
