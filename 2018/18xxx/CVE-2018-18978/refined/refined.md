{
  "CVE-2018-18978": {
    "Root cause": "The application uses a static encryption key and initialization vector (IV) for encrypting user data. These are hardcoded within the application's code.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Static encryption key",
      "Static IV",
      "Use of a weak/vulnerable encryption scheme by using static keys and IV"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can decrypt user data, and subsequently, modify user data by encrypting modified data using the static key and IV. This allows for manipulation of personal health information like glucose readings, which can lead to incorrect medical prognosis.",
    "Attack vectors": "Reverse engineering of the mobile application (Android or iOS) to retrieve the static key and IV. Network interception of data using a proxy to observe encrypted communication. Then use reverse engineered information to decrypt and encrypt the data.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to reverse engineer the mobile application, intercept network traffic, and craft malicious requests. The attacker does not need to be within Bluetooth range, they can potentially impact any user."
