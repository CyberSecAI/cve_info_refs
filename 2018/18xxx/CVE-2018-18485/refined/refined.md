The provided content describes a vulnerability in the `phpshe` project, which allows for arbitrary file deletion and subsequent remote code execution.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an arbitrary file deletion flaw within the `phpshe` application. It appears the application's backend allows for deleting files based on user-supplied input without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Arbitrary file deletion: The application allows users to delete files on the server through an unvalidated mechanism.
- Remote code execution: By deleting `install.lock`, an attacker can trigger the installation process again, injecting malicious PHP code and achieve remote code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file deletion: Attackers can delete any file on the server that the application has permissions to access. This could lead to data loss or service disruption.
- Remote code execution: Successful exploitation leads to complete compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to data theft, further attacks on internal networks, and more.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is performed through the application's backend, likely through a web interface.
- The attacker needs access to the vulnerable backend functionality.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have access to the administrative backend of the `phpshe` application.
- They must be able to send crafted requests that trigger the file deletion vulnerability.
- Basic knowledge of web application exploitation and PHP is needed to create the RCE payload.

**More details compared to the CVE description:**
The content provides detailed steps of the exploit, including:
- How to trigger arbitrary file deletion by targeting `install.lock`.
- How to exploit the subsequent installation process to gain remote code execution via a crafted payload such as `';phpinfo();'`.
- Provides screenshots that clearly show the vulnerable interface and exploitation steps.
- The issue report is marked with "Content Risk Flag" indicating that the report was flagged for containing sensitive information and code security bugs.
