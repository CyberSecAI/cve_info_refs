Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2018-18862:

**Root Cause:** Multiple security vulnerabilities exist within BMC Remedy + ITAM versions 7.1.00 and 9.1.02.003. These vulnerabilities stem from insufficient access controls and insecure handling of sensitive data within the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Forceful Browsing of ITAM Forms:** Authenticated users can access ITAM forms that are not intended to be directly accessible through the standard web user interface. This is achieved by directly requesting the form via its URL.
    *   **Example URL:** `https://${MIDTIERSERVER}/arsys/forms/${ARSERVER}/AR+System+Mid+Tier+Object+List/Default+Admin+View/`

2.  **Exposure of ITAM Usernames:** Authenticated users can obtain lists of existing ITAM usernames through specific forms. This information can be used for password-based attacks.
    *   **Example URLs:**
        *   `https://${MIDTIERSERVER}/arsys/forms/${ARSERVER}/User/Default+Admin+View1/`
        *  `https://${MIDTIERSERVER}/arsys/forms/${ARSERVER}/CMF%3AUsers/CreateUsersView/`
        *  `https://${MIDTIERSERVER}/arsys/forms/${ARSERVER}/CMF%3AUserViewForm/Default+Administrator+View/`
        *   `https://${MIDTIERSERVER}/arsys/forms/${ARSERVER}/CTM%3APeople/Default+User+View/`

3. **Exposure of Plain-Text Credentials:** Authenticated users can reveal plain-text passwords by changing the input type of password fields within certain ITAM forms. This is because the application does not prevent the modification of form elements in the browser.
     *   **Example URLs:**
        *   `https://${MIDTIERSERVER}/arsys/forms/${ARSERVER}/TLS%3APLR-Configuration+Details/Default+Admin+View/`
        *   `https://${MIDTIERSERVER}/arsys/forms/${ARSERVER}/CMF%3APluginConfiguration/Default+Administrator+View/`
        *   Other forms may also be vulnerable.

4. **Filesystem Traversal and Browsing:** Authenticated users can browse the filesystem of the underlying operating system through a specific ITAM form, gaining access to files according to the privileges of the ITAM process user.
    *   **Example URL:**
        * `https://${MIDTIERSERVER}/arsys/forms/${ARSERVER}/AR+System+Administration%3A+Server+Information/Default+Admin+View/`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Horizontal and Vertical Privilege Escalation:** By chaining these vulnerabilities, attackers could escalate their privileges within the ITAM application, potentially gaining access to more sensitive data and administrative functions.
*   **Password-Based Attacks:** The exposure of usernames makes password attacks easier to execute.
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can obtain sensitive data like other users' credentials and potentially other sensitive system files.
*   **Potential Operating System Command Execution:**  In some scenarios, these vulnerabilities, combined with other flaws, could be leveraged to execute commands on the underlying operating system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Browser:** Exploitation is achieved through a web browser by sending specific requests to the vulnerable ITAM application forms.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have valid credentials to log into the BMC Remedy + ITAM application.
* **Browser access:** Access to a web browser is required to access the application.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided information is more detailed than what is typically found in a standard CVE description.
*  The attacker does not require any special system permissions beyond a standard ITAM user.
* The vulnerability can be chained together.
* The vendor was notified of the issues but did not provide immediate remediation.
