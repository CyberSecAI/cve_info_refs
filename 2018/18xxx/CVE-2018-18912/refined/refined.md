Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-18912:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Easy File Sharing (EFS) Web Server 7.2.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow: The application does not properly validate the size of the input data when handling the 'author' parameter in a POST request to the `forum.ghp` endpoint. This allows an attacker to overwrite parts of the stack.
- Lack of input validation: The web server fails to validate the size of the "author" parameter when creating a new forum topic.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: By overflowing the buffer on the stack, an attacker can overwrite the saved return address (SEH overwrite) and control the execution flow to execute arbitrary code on the target system.
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker can execute malicious shellcode on the victim's machine, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/forum.ghp` endpoint of the web server.
- "author" parameter:  The buffer overflow is triggered through the `author` parameter within the POST request's form data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated user: The attacker needs to be authenticated as a valid user to create a new topic in the forums.
- Network access: The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
- Knowledge of the application: The attacker needs to know that the `forum.ghp` endpoint exists and the `author` parameter is vulnerable.
- Ability to craft malicious request: The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious payload.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided exploit code leverages a ROP (Return-Oriented Programming) chain to bypass Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and execute shellcode.
- The exploit overwrites the SEH handler to redirect execution flow to the ROP chain.
- The exploit utilizes various ROP gadgets to prepare the stack and execute shellcode, ultimately leading to remote code execution.
- The code blocks show a crafted HTTP request containing a long string of "A"s in the author parameter followed by a SEH overwrite and a ROP chain.
- The exploit code includes a shellcode to execute calc.exe, which is a common way to test a RCE exploit.
