{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to a flaw in handling uploaded files, specifically image files, which allows an attacker to read these files via a vulnerable interface.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Arbitrary file read vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files, including malicious files (e.g., web shells) uploaded to the server, and then use these files to gain remote code execution by writing them to the website's root directory.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker exploits a vulnerable interface to read uploaded image files containing malicious code.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to upload a malicious image file to the server. They must also be able to access the vulnerable interface to read the uploaded file."
