```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when editing product tags in the admin panel.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The product tag editor allows arbitrary HTML to be stored.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the product tags. When a user views a product page, the injected script will execute in the user's browser within the context of the web application. This could allow the attacker to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other actions on behalf of the victim.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to access the admin panel and edit product tags with malicious JavaScript in HTML tags.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have administrative access to the application's backend to modify product tags."
