{
  "cveId": "CVE-2018-18760",
  "related": true,
  "info": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability lies in the `download.php` file, specifically in the way it handles file downloads. The script uses user-supplied parameters to construct the file path without proper sanitization or validation, leading to an arbitrary file download vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Path Traversal"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can download any file from the server, which could include sensitive configuration files, databases, or other confidential information.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "HTTP GET request with crafted parameters"
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is needed to trigger the vulnerability.",
     "additionalDetails": "The `download.php` script uses `getParam()` to retrieve the file path from a 'file' parameter and concatenates this with the 'files/' prefix. This allows an attacker to use path traversal sequences such as `../` within the 'file' parameter to access files outside the intended 'files' directory. Additionally, the script uses the `name`, `size`, and `type` parameters in the header of the HTTP response."
