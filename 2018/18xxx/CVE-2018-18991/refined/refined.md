- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before reflecting it back in the web page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser within the context of the vulnerable web application. This can lead to various attacks, such as session hijacking, defacement, or phishing.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing JavaScript code. When a victim clicks this URL, the application reflects this script back in the web page, and the victim's browser executes it. This is a non-persistent attack, as the script is not stored on the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to entice a victim to click on a crafted link, for example through phishing emails or social media. The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any special privileges on the server.
