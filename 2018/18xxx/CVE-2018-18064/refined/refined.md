{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "An out-of-bounds memset in libcairo, specifically within the `_cairo_image_spans_and_zero` function called by `generate()`. The root cause likely resides in the logic of the `generate()` function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack buffer overflow due to `_cairo_image_spans_and_zero()` writing zeros to stack out of allocated memory boundaries.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Stack buffer overflow leading to a crash, with potential to overwrite the stack canary and return address. Besides denial of service, the potential for unspecified effects also exists.",
  "Attack vectors": "Crafted HTML/CSS/Javascript to trigger the vulnerable code path within libcairo via WebKitGTK. Specifically, the provided PoC demonstrates how the manipulation of CSS properties in a webpage can trigger the out-of-bounds write.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to render the malicious crafted HTML/CSS/Javascript in a browser that uses WebKitGTK with the vulnerable libcairo library."
