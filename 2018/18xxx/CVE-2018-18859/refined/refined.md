  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2018-18859",
      "root_cause": "The LiquidVPN helper tool, com.smr.liquidvpn.OVPNHelper, which runs with root privileges, does not sanitize the 'tun_path' or 'tap_path' parameters in XPC messages before using them in a `system()` call to load kernel extensions. This allows a local attacker to specify a malicious kernel extension path.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient input sanitization",
        "Privilege escalation",
        "Arbitrary kernel extension loading"
      ],
       "impact": "A local attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution with root privileges by loading a malicious kernel extension, leading to full system compromise.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local exploitation",
	"XPC messages"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": [
        "Local access to the target system",
	"Ability to send XPC messages"
      ],
      "additional_information": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of the 'tun_path' and 'tap_path' parameters when they are passed to the `system()` function which executes the `kextload()` command. While macOS 10.13+ requires signed kexts, the user approval mechanism does not require a root password, making this still exploitable by local users."
