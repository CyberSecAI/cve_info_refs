Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2018-18023:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `SVGStripString` function within the `svg.c` file of ImageMagick.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Heap-buffer-overflow:** The `SVGStripString` function attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer in the heap, leading to the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The heap-buffer-overflow can cause a crash, leading to a denial of service.
- **Possible Code Execution:** The USN mentions "possibly execute code with the privileges of the user invoking the program," suggesting that under specific circumstances, this vulnerability could be exploited for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malformed SVG Image:** The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted SVG image file.
- An attacker can craft a malicious SVG file designed to trigger the overflow in the `SVGStripString` function when processed by ImageMagick.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Provide Malicious Input:** The attacker needs to provide the malformed SVG file to a system using ImageMagick. This could involve tricking a user or automated process into opening the file.
- **No Special Privileges Needed:** The attacker does not need special privileges to trigger the vulnerability, it is triggered by the ImageMagick process itself when processing the malicious input.

**Additional Details:**

- The Github issue #1336 provides a specific proof-of-concept (POC) file, further detailing the issue.
- The Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-4034-1) confirms that the vulnerability was fixed in several ImageMagick versions.
- The stack trace from the AddressSanitizer output shows the exact location of the overflow, at `coders/svg.c:572` within `SVGStripString`.
- The output from ASAN also provides details about the memory allocation and shadow bytes, which confirm the heap-buffer-overflow and the out-of-bounds write.
