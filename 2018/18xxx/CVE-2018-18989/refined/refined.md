- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to check if it is referencing freed memory when processing project files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use-after-free vulnerability (CWE-416).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could use a specially crafted project file to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation requires a specially crafted project file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted project file, likely requiring local access or social engineering to convince a user to open the malicious file. The attack requires user interaction.
