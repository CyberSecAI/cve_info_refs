Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described:

**Vulnerability 1: Unrestricted File Upload leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE)**

*   **Root Cause:** The application allows uploading of ZIP archives and extracts them without proper filtering or sanitization.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application only checks the file extension (`.zip`) but not the content.
    *   **Arbitrary File Extraction:** The application extracts the uploaded archive to a location determined by user-controlled input, allowing for overwriting existing files and creating new ones.
    *   **Lack of Sanitization:** The extracted files are not checked for malicious content, allowing attackers to upload and execute arbitrary code.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Remote code execution (RCE). An attacker can upload a malicious archive containing a web shell, extract it to the web server's document root, and gain control of the server.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Upload a specially crafted ZIP archive containing a web shell.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Access to the administrative panel of the application.

**Vulnerability 2: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE)**

*   **Root Cause:** The component upload functionality lacks CSRF protection.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Missing CSRF Protection:** The upload functionality does not implement any CSRF protection mechanisms, such as CSRF tokens, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Remote code execution (RCE). An attacker can exploit the missing CSRF protection to force an authenticated administrator to upload and extract a malicious ZIP archive containing a web shell, gaining control of the server.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Craft a malicious HTML page containing a CSRF exploit that triggers the upload and extract functionality when an authenticated admin visits the page.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to trick an authenticated administrator into visiting a malicious webpage.

**Summary of Vulnerabilities:**
The identified vulnerabilities involve the insecure handling of file uploads, specifically within the component management functionality of PopojiCMS. The system is vulnerable to both direct file upload attacks and CSRF attacks. By exploiting the lack of filtering on uploaded ZIP archives, or by tricking an admin into making the request, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the affected server.

These vulnerabilities are present because the application lacks proper input validation, sanitization and CSRF protection.
