{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow in the `tab-to-csv` function within `tab-to-csv.c`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The argument `end` passed to the `write_wchars` function can overflow due to the operation `i - 1`.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of Service (DoS)",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted input that causes the integer overflow in the calculation of the `end` argument.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to provide input to the `tab-to-csv` function that triggers the overflow when calculating `i - 1`."
