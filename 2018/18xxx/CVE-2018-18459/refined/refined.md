Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities discovered in xpdf-4.00, specifically affecting the `pdftoppm` tool:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **`DCTStream::readScan@Stream.cc-3051___out-of-bounds-read`**
    *   **Root Cause:** An out-of-bounds read occurs within the `DCTStream::readScan` function. This happens when processing DCT encoded data, where the code tries to access memory outside the allocated buffer.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds read.
    *   **Impact:** Crash (segfault) due to invalid memory access.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted PDF file.
    *   **Attacker Capability:** The attacker needs to provide a crafted PDF file that will trigger the vulnerability when processed by `pdftoppm`.

2.  **`CCITTFaxStream::readRow@Stream.cc-1822___heap-buffer-overflow`**
    *   **Root Cause:** Heap buffer overflow in the `CCITTFaxStream::readRow` function. This occurs when processing CCITT Fax encoded data, writing beyond the allocated heap buffer.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Heap buffer overflow.
    *   **Impact:** Crash due to memory corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted PDF file.
    *   **Attacker Capability:** The attacker needs to provide a crafted PDF file that will trigger the vulnerability when processed by `pdftoppm`.

3.  **`Object::isName@Object.h-134___stack-buffer-overflow`**
    *  **Root Cause:** A stack buffer overflow occurs within the `Object::isName` function. This happens when parsing specific PDF objects, leading to a write beyond the allocated stack buffer.
    *  **Vulnerability:** Stack buffer overflow.
    *  **Impact:** Crash due to stack corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted PDF file.
    *   **Attacker Capability:** The attacker needs to provide a crafted PDF file that will trigger the vulnerability when processed by `pdftoppm`.

4.  **`DCTStream::getBlock@Stream.cc-2812___out-of-bounds-read`**
    *   **Root Cause:** An out-of-bounds read in the `DCTStream::getBlock` function when processing DCT encoded data. This occurs when the code attempts to read data from a memory location outside of an allocated buffer.
    *  **Vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds read.
    *   **Impact:** Crash (segfault) due to an invalid memory access.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted PDF file.
    *   **Attacker Capability:** The attacker needs to provide a crafted PDF file that will trigger the vulnerability when processed by `pdftoppm`.

5.  **`DCTStream::readHuffSym@Stream.cc-3662___heap-buffer-overflow`**
    *   **Root Cause:** A heap buffer overflow within the `DCTStream::readHuffSym` function. This happens while processing Huffman encoded data, where the code writes beyond the allocated heap buffer.
    *  **Vulnerability:** Heap buffer overflow.
    *   **Impact:** Crash due to memory corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted PDF file.
    *   **Attacker Capability:** The attacker needs to provide a crafted PDF file that will trigger the vulnerability when processed by `pdftoppm`.

6.  **`DCTStream::decodeImage@Stream.cc-3325___out-of-bounds-read`**
    *   **Root Cause:** An out-of-bounds read in the `DCTStream::decodeImage` function when decoding a DCT image. This occurs when the code tries to read data from a memory location outside the bounds of an allocated buffer.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds read.
    *   **Impact:** Crash (segfault) due to an invalid memory access.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted PDF file.
    *  **Attacker Capability:** The attacker needs to provide a crafted PDF file that will trigger the vulnerability when processed by `pdftoppm`.

7. **`GfxImageColorMap::GfxImageColorMap@GfxState.cc-3550___heap-buffer-overflow`**
    *  **Root Cause:** A heap buffer overflow within the `GfxImageColorMap` constructor. This occurs during the construction of a color map from a PDF object, where the code attempts to read data from a memory location outside the bounds of an allocated buffer
    *  **Vulnerability:** Heap buffer overflow.
    *   **Impact:** Crash due to memory corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted PDF file.
    *  **Attacker Capability:** The attacker needs to provide a crafted PDF file that will trigger the vulnerability when processed by `pdftoppm`.

**Commonalities:**

*   All vulnerabilities are located in the `xpdf` library, specifically in the stream processing part.
*   The primary attack vector for all identified vulnerabilities is a maliciously crafted PDF file that exploits these issues when processed by `pdftoppm`.
*   The impact is primarily crashes (segfaults) due to memory access violations, though some have the potential for arbitrary code execution through memory corruption.
