## RESEARCH

## Our research and development programme sets industry standards in cyber security

At Dionach we are proud of our well-established research and development programme. Our team of consultants are focused on continually uncovering new technical vulnerabilities in software and hardware, raising the bar in security assessment services and sharing our knowledge through whitepapers and various industry channels.

Through the responsible disclosure process we have published numerous vulnerabilities in leading software applications that our team has identified.

As part of our commitment to remaining vendor independent and offering the best technical solution to each client engagement, we also develop proprietary security tools for testing methods including vulnerability scanning, spear phishing and security auditing. In practice, our consultants have a wide range of commercial, open-source and custom tools at their disposal to deliver industry-leading outcomes for our client base.

Some of our custom tools are published as open source on Dionach’s GitHub page: [https://github.com/Dionach.](https://github.com/Dionach)

# CVE-2018-18863 ResourceLink Local File Inclusion

In a recent penetration test ResourceLink version 20.0.2.1 was found to be vulnerable to local file inclusion (LFI). ResourceLink is a payroll web application that allows HR departments to manage payments and employees’ bank account details.

LFI allows an attacker to include the contents of another file hosted on the web server, within a web page. Only files to which the web service has read access can be included.

The vulnerability exists in the “logfiledownload” parameter which is part of the ResourceLink support section included within the ResourceLink application. The support section was accessible with default and weak credentials (support/support). The vulnerable parameter allows an authenticated user to view logs of the web application. However, an attacker can abuse this functionality to read files on the server, such as “C:\Windows\win.ini”, as shown below.

https://[redacted]/support/logfiledownload?file=**..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\Windows\win.ini**&download=false
![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](/wp-content/uploads/files/sites/other/files/resourcelink_01.png)

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read files containing sensitive information stored on the server, such as clear text credentials or session cookies. The following example shows it was possible to retrieve JSESSIONIDs, URL session IDs, and clear-text passwords from a log file:

https://[redacted]/support/logfiledownload?file=**..\..\logs\server.log**&download=false
![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](/wp-content/uploads/files/sites/other/files/resourcelink_02.png)

Furthermore, an attacker can abuse this vulnerability to read the SQL connection string, which contains the credentials that ResourceLink web application uses to connect to the Oracle database:

https://[redacted]/support/logfiledownload?file=**..\..\config\domain.xml**&download=false
![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](/wp-content/uploads/files/sites/other/files/resourcelink_03.png)

As result, this would allow an attacker to access data stored in the Oracle database such as bank account details:

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](/wp-content/uploads/files/sites/other/files/resourcelink_04.png)

## Cyber Security for Technology

The high-tech sector is often ground zero for cyber-attacks. One obvious reason is that these organizations have very valuable information to be stolen. Working with key players in the tech industry to ensure they have the right IT security controls and help them identify potential weaknesses.

## Key Threats Affecting the Technology Sector in Cyber Security

The threats posed to high-tech organisations are wide-ranging, varying from IP theft to ransomware. Attacks designed to gain access to systems and data at rest are not uncommon. Big tech companies store and process huge volumes of data per second making them a sure target for bad actors.

25%

25% of all cyber attacks in 2019 were directed at the tech sector.

70%

The targets of phishing emails opened more than 70% of them. Phishing attempts happen on a weekly or daily basis for 57% of businesses.

5 billion

5 billion

The database breach was recorded as 5 billion in 2021. LinkedIn was breached, exposing 700 million records while Facebook had more than 533 million accounts breached.

## CYBER SECURITY CHallenges in THE Technology SECTOR

## Cloud Vulnerabilities

The cloud storage is utilized by everyone, whether for archiving personal photos or highly confidential company files. The development of modern technologies can lead one to believe that the cloud is now more secure; however, this is not the case.

Over the last 5 years, it has been estimated that there has been an increase of over 150% in cloud vulnerabilities. Misconfigured storage, unsecured application programming interfaces, and illegal access to cloud root accounts are just a few ways of how hackers get access to highly sensitive information during a cyberattack against a cloud-based services, denying businesses access to their data.

## Threat of Supply Chain Attacks

In today’s highly connected global economy, many companies rely on third-party services such as online payment processors to keep up with customer demand. As a result, third party companies get access to private information and data. Cybercriminals use this factor to bypass security measures and systems by targeting the less secure networks of secondary targets.

In 2021, cyber criminals entered Socialarks, a third-party contractor for social media platforms of Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn, marking one of the most catastrophic hacks to date. In the end, 214 million users had their account information compromised.

## Social Engineering Attacks

Social engineering is a malevolent threat that most advanced cyber security systems cannot stop because it targets the most vulnerable link in the cyber security chain – people!

Humans are prone to errors; the extensive use of electronic communication such as email, text messaging, and social media makes them an easy target for cybercriminals. Social engineering attacks are centered around deception; the most prevalent form is Phishing.

As a result, high-tech organizations typically have a very large attack surface to protect. Increasing cybercrime requires that a cybersecurity strategy that addresses specific cyberthreats in the technology sector which evolves around the following components-
