The provided content relates to CVE-2018-18863.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the "logfiledownload" parameter of the ResourceLink web application, which allows for local file inclusion (LFI).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability: The application allows an attacker to read arbitrary files from the server file system by manipulating the 'file' parameter in the logfiledownload functionality.
- Weak default credentials: The support section of the application is accessible with default/weak credentials (support/support), which makes the LFI vulnerability easily exploitable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: Attackers can read sensitive files on the server, potentially including:
    - Cleartext credentials
    - Session cookies (JSESSIONIDs, URL session IDs)
    - SQL connection strings (including database credentials)
- Database access: By obtaining the SQL connection string, an attacker can gain access to the Oracle database and steal sensitive information like bank account details.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request to the `/support/logfiledownload` endpoint with a manipulated `file` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated access to the ResourceLink support section. The default credentials (support/support) make this easily achievable.
- Ability to craft HTTP requests, to manipulate the `file` parameter to access desired files.
