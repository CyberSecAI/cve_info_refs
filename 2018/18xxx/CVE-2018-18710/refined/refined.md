    "rootCause": "Integer overflow in the CDROM driver.",

      "Integer Overflow",
      "Improper type cast leading to failed bounds check"

    "impact": "A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory) or cause a denial of service (system crash).",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Local access to a CDROM device",
        "Specially crafted input to the CDROM_SELECT_DISC ioctl"

    "requiredCapabilities": [
      "Local access to the CDROM device"
    ],
        "description": "The cdrom driver does not correctly validate the parameter to the CDROM_SELECT_DISC ioctl. A user with access to a cdrom device could use this to read sensitive information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service (crash). There is a cast from unsigned long to int which causes a bounds check to fail with specially crafted input. The value is then used as an index in the slot array in cdrom_slot_status()."
