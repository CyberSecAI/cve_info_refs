## Optional Telerik Removal

As of the 9.11.0 release, Telerik has been completely removed from the codebase; however, sites utilizing modules depending on Telerik can still be upgraded to the latest version of DNN 9. While Telerik removal is still optional for upgrades, it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

* If you perform a clean install of this version, Telerik will NOT be installed.
* If you upgrade an instance where Telerik was previously removed, it will NOT be reinstalled.
* If you upgrade an instance that still has the Telerik libraries installed, the upgrade process will guide you through options to keep or remove Telerik. Additionally, if you can't remove Telerik at the moment of upgrade but plan to do it later on, a wizard will be installed to help you remove Telerik later.

## Additional Resources.

Is this your first time installing or upgrading DNN? If so, you can find some help with the [installation](https://dnndocs.com/content/tutorials/server/setup/administrators-setup-overview/index.html) and [upgrade](https://dnndocs.com/content/getting-started/setup/upgrades/index.html) wiki articles. If this is your 100th time upgrading DNN, maybe review the guides and submit a few changes!

## Optional Telerik Removal

As of the 9.11.0 release, Telerik has been completely removed from the codebase; however, sites utilizing modules depending on Telerik can still be upgraded to the latest version of DNN 9. While Telerik removal is still optional for upgrades, it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

* If you perform a clean install of this version, Telerik will NOT be installed.
* If you upgrade an instance where Telerik was previously removed, it will NOT be reinstalled.
* If you upgrade an instance that still has the Telerik libraries installed, the upgrade process will guide you through options to keep or remove Telerik. Additionally, if you can't remove Telerik at the moment of upgrade but plan to do it later on, a wizard will be installed to help you remove Telerik later.

## Additional Resources.

Is this your first time installing or upgrading DNN? If so, you can find some help with the [installation](https://dnndocs.com/content/tutorials/server/setup/administrators-setup-overview/index.html) and [upgrade](https://dnndocs.com/content/getting-started/setup/upgrades/index.html) wiki articles. If this is your 100th time upgrading DNN, maybe review the guides and submit a few changes!

## Optional Telerik Removal

As of the 9.11.0 release, Telerik has been completely removed from the codebase; however, sites utilizing modules depending on Telerik can still be upgraded to the latest version of DNN 9. While Telerik removal is still optional for upgrades, it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

* If you perform a clean install of this version, Telerik will NOT be installed.
* If you upgrade an instance where Telerik was previously removed, it will NOT be reinstalled.
* If you upgrade an instance that still has the Telerik libraries installed, the upgrade process will guide you through options to keep or remove Telerik. Additionally, if you can't remove Telerik at the moment of upgrade but plan to do it later on, a wizard will be installed to help you remove Telerik later.

## Additional Resources.

Is this your first time installing or upgrading DNN? If so, you can find some help with the [installation](https://dnndocs.com/content/tutorials/server/setup/administrators-setup-overview/index.html) and [upgrade](https://dnndocs.com/content/getting-started/setup/upgrades/index.html) wiki articles. If this is your 100th time upgrading DNN, maybe review the guides and submit a few changes!

## Optional Telerik Removal

As of the 9.11.0 release, Telerik has been completely removed from the codebase; however, sites utilizing modules depending on Telerik can still be upgraded to the latest version of DNN 9. While Telerik removal is still optional for upgrades, it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

* If you perform a clean install of this version, Telerik will NOT be installed.
* If you upgrade an instance where Telerik was previously removed, it will NOT be reinstalled.
* If you upgrade an instance that still has the Telerik libraries installed, the upgrade process will guide you through options to keep or remove Telerik. Additionally, if you can't remove Telerik at the moment of upgrade but plan to do it later on, a wizard will be installed to help you remove Telerik later.
