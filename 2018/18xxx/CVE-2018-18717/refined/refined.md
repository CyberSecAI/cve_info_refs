- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when processing image URLs. Specifically, the `query` parameter in the `ajax.php` endpoint is vulnerable to injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions on the victim's browser.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL with JavaScript code embedded in the `query` parameter and tricking a user into accessing it (through social engineering, or by other means), an attacker can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to craft a malicious URL, and the victim must be a user of the application, specifically someone with access to the admin panel. The target user needs to be tricked into accessing the crafted malicious link via browser, and their browser should support Flash.
