Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-18805:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw present in the `LoginForm1.vb` file of the "Point of Sales (POS) in VB.Net MySQL Database 1.0" application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The application directly incorporates user-supplied input (`UsernameTextBox.Text` and `PasswordTextBox.Text`) into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*   Specifically, the `USERNAME` field is vulnerable to SQL injection. The password field uses sha1 which limits attacks, however user input is still used in the SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach/Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to bypass authentication, access sensitive information from the database (user credentials, sales data, etc.), modify existing records, or execute arbitrary SQL commands.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker could potentially gain administrative privileges if the application's data model and permissions system is not designed with least privilege in mind.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Login Form:** The primary attack vector is through the application's login form, specifically the `UsernameTextBox` and potentially the `PasswordTextBox`.
*   An attacker can craft a malicious username, injecting SQL code. The provided example uses `'||(SEleCT 'Efe' FRoM DuaL WheRE 113=113 AnD (SEleCT 64 FRom(SELeCT CoUNT(*),ConCAT(ConCAT(0x203a20,UsER(),DAtABAsE(),VErSIoN()),(SelEcT (ELT(64=64,1))),FLooR(RAnD(0)*2))x FRoM INFOrMATIoN_SchEMA.pLUGINS GroUP By x)a))||'` as the username to extract database information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs access to the application's login interface.
*   No special privileges are required; the vulnerability can be exploited remotely.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code snippet is in `LoginForm1.vb`:
```vb
Private Sub OK_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles OK.Click
        sql = "SELECT * FROM `tblemployee` WHERE `USERNAME` ='" & UsernameTextBox.Text & "' and `PASSWRD` = sha1('" & PasswordTextBox.Text & "')"
        janobefindthis(sql)
```
This code directly concatenates the user input into the SQL query string, making it vulnerable to injection.
