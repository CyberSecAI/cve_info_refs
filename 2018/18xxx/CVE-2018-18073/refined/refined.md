{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the exposure of system operators in the saved execution stack within an error object in Artifex Ghostscript. This allows attackers to bypass the sandbox protection mechanism.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Exposure of system operators in saved execution stack",
      "Insufficient sandbox protection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to bypass sandbox restrictions, potentially leading to arbitrary file access or arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Processing a specially crafted PostScript file",
        "Exploiting system operators exposed via the saved execution stack in an error object"
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious postscript file to ghostscript. No special access is needed, just the ability to invoke the program with the malicious file."
