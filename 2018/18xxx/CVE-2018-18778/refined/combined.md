### mini\_httpd - small HTTP server

[Fetch the software.](mini_httpd-1.30.tar.gz)

![IPv6](/resources/images/ipv6-ready.gif)

mini\_httpd is a small HTTP server.
Its performance is not great, but for low or medium traffic sites it's
quite adequate.
It implements all the basic features of an HTTP server, including:

* GET, HEAD, and POST methods.
* CGI.
* Basic authentication.
* Security against ".." filename snooping.
* The common MIME types.
* Trailing-slash redirection.
* index.html, index.htm, index.cgi
* Directory listings.
* Multihoming / virtual hosting.
* Standard logging.
* Custom error pages.

It can also be configured to do SSL/HTTPS and IPv6.

mini\_httpd was written for a couple reasons.
One, as an experiment to see just how slow an old-fashioned forking web
server would be with today's operating systems.
The answer is, surprisingly, not that slow - on FreeBSD 3.2, mini\_httpd
benchmarks at about 90% the speed of Apache.
The other main reason for writing mini\_httpd was to get a simple platform
for experimenting with new web server technology, for instance SSL.

New in version 1.30:

* Enlarged request read buffer to 50KB.
* Fix security bug that let remote users read arbitrary files. (HuJin@topsec alpha\_lab as CVE-2018-18778)

New in version 1.29:

* Allow CGI to handle HTTP methods besides GET/HEAD/POST.

New in version 1.28:

* Fix to buffer overrun bug in htpasswd. Reported by Alessio Santoru as CVE-2017-17663.
* Some fixes to keep connections from getting stuck forever in FIN\_WAIT\_2 state.

New in version 1.27:

* Fixed bug that prevented binary CGI results from working.
  This bug was introduced in 1.23.
  Noticed and diagnosed by Qipeng Zhang.

New in version 1.26:

* Long-standing bug on FreeBSD using http but not https.
  Files were getting truncated at 1MB.
  This was due to improper usage of sendfile(2), and not
  testing the http path since I only use mini\_httpd for
  https.
  Since Linux has a completely different sendfile(2) call,
  it was not affected.
  And since https does not use sendfile(2), it also was not
  affected.

New in version 1.25:

* Improvements to the FreeBSD startup script. (Craig Leres)
* Improvement to SSL support.

New in version 1.24:

* Disable SSLv2 to prevent DROWN attack.
* Fix binary POST request reading. (Erik Waling)

New in version 1.23:

* Fixed CVE-2015-1548, a buffer overflow via snprintf.

New in version 1.22:

* Don't do TCP\_NOPUSH on SSL connections. It doesn't help and causes problems.
* Use memmove() for self-overlapping string copies instead of strcpy().

New in version 1.21:

* Disable SSL 3 because of the "poodle" attack.

New in version 1.20:

* Better handling for very large files.
* Use TCP\_CORK if it's available and TCP\_NOPUSH is not.
* Ignore ECONNABORTED on accept().
* Removed mailto: link from the default index page.
* Allow CGIs to provide both Location and Status headers. (A. Skrobov)
* Better logic for figuring out CGI SERVER\_NAME environment variable. (Oleg)
* Updated for clang, and general cleanup.

New in version 1.19:

* Prohibit "Host: ." and "Host: .." (David Leadbeater).
* Use the specified charset in directory listings and errors
  (Jonas Ohlsson).
* Close and re-open the log file on SIGHUP.
  This includes code to chown the log file when starting up as root
  so that after switching uids to nobody (or whatever user you
  configure) it can still be re-opened.
  And there's also code to tweak the logfile pathname after a chroot
  so that it still works.
* Generate multiple MIME encodings in the correct order, and with
  the correct separator.
* Re-wrote the read() and write() loops to handle EINTR and EAGAIN.
* Save and restore errno in signal handlers.
* Corrected possible buffer overflow in building CGI environment
  (Bernhard Reiter).
* Simplified handling of HAVE\_INT64T (Trisk).
  If this causes problems, e.g. if there are still systems which don't
  have "long long", we can back out the change.
* Automatically add no-cache control header on error responses.

New in version 1.18:

* Added a bunch of MIME types.
* Allow blank lines in the config file.
* Digital Unix 4.0d doesn't have int64\_t.
* Use unsigned short consistently for port number.
* Prohibit slashes in the Host: header (Marcus Breiing).
* For some reason there was never a timeout on writing the response, only
  on reading the request; fixed.
* Don't send Content-Length header on 304 Not Modified responses.
* Allow user-agent log entries to be up to 200 characters long, instead
  only of 80.
* Changed most uses of \r and \n to \015 and \012 (Jens Bauer).
* Got rid of extra slash in PATH\_TRANSLATED (Benedikt Hochstrasser).

New in version 1.17:

* Simplified the IPv6 ifdefs.
* Remove /./ in de\_dotdot() (Dana Dahlstrom).
* Added an madvise(MADV\_SEQUENTIAL) call for the cases that use mmap().
* Added .xhtml and .xht to mime\_types.txt (suggested by Dave Hodder).
* Made the list of possible index filenames into an array instead
  of hard-coded.
* Added a bunch of syslogs.
* On generated pages which set BGCOLOR, also set TEXT LINK and VLINK.
* Added some OpenOffice MIME types (Dave Hodder).

New in version 1.16:

* Some fixes for unusual cases in the CGI file-descriptor shuffling
  (Michael Gorlick).
* On SysV use sigset() instead of signal() (David Koblas).
* Set up accept filters after listen() (Kris Spinka).
* Preserve query string when doing a missing-slash directory redirect.
* New port.h defines for NetBSD.
* Fix for security hole that exposed contents of .htpasswd in some
  cases (noticed by zeno@cgisecurity.com).
* Allow (and ignore) extra fields in .htpasswd files.

  and Rob Ekl).

* Set TCP\_NOPUSH socket option.
* Switch htpasswd from using tmpnam to mkstemp.
* Use memmove instead of memcpy.
* Fix to de\_dotdot (Mark Dunlap).
* Added portability defines for Digital Unix.
* Off-by-one error in base-64 decoding (Archie Cobbs).
* URL-encoding in directory listings.
* Fix (harmless) subprocess SEGV on null requests (noticed by
  Tyler Mitchell).
* Ignore EINTR on select call when doing IPv4 and IPv6 (noticed by Tyler Mitchell).
* Added -V version flag.
* Added a timeout on request reading.
* Corrected some uses of size\_t and off\_t.
* Now able to serve files larger than 2GB.
* Default installation direction is now /usr/local/sbin, not
  /usr/local/bin.
* Added a scripts subdirectory with some sample code for FreeBSD systems.
* Added a -P flag for setting the P3P header.
* Added a -C config-file option similar to thttpd's.
* Added flags to specify the SSL certificate file and cipher set.

New in version 1.12:

* Fix for directory indexes on Linux - symlinks were not indexing right
  due to a bug in Linux's ls.
* Solaris/SysV fix - it was exitting after serving a single request, due
  to SIGCHLD generating an EINTR.
* A change in the way wildcard matching works - now a single \* only
  matches strings that don't include a slash.
  To match entire pathnames including slashes you have to use \*\*.
* Fix for index.cgi - it was returning the file's contents instead
  of running it.
* On systems with IPv6, automatically bind to both v4 and v6 sockets.
* Added charset=iso-8859-1 to text MIME types.
