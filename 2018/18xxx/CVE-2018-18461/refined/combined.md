The plugin will send the following hooks:

* do\_action(‘arigato\_subscribed’, $status, $user\_id) – when an user subscribes. The variable $status is true when the subscription is immediately activated and false if email confirmation is required,
* do\_action(‘arigato\_confirmed’, $member->id) – when a subscriber confirms their email address.
* do\_action(‘arigato\_unsubscribed’, $user) – when a subscriber unsubscribes. Sends the user object and not the ID so you don’t need to run a select query with this action.
* do\_action(‘arigato\_welcome\_email’, $user\_id, $mail, $user) – when the user receives a welcome (first “0 days” email).
* do\_action(‘arigato\_subscribed’, $status, $user\_id) – called when the new user subscribes. The argument $status is true when the subscriber is already activated and false when double optin confirmation is expected.
* do\_action(“arigato\_cron\_job\_ran”) – called when the plugin completes the cron job (once on each run). No arguments passed.
* do\_action(“arigato\_sent\_newsletter”, $newsletter\_id, $num\_mails\_sent) – called after sending newsletter. Passes the newsletter ID and the number of emails sent.

  Send instant newsletter to all active subscribers

## Installation

1. Unzip the contents and upload the entire `bft-autoresponder` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress
3. Configure the sender address and other options from the main page accessible from the newly appeared “Arigato Light” menu.
4. Manage your email messages and mailing list.
5. In order to send automated sequential emails every day your blog should be visited at least once daily. If this is not happening, please set up a cron job to visit it using the command shown in your Arigato Light Settings page.

## FAQ

### Can I send unlimited messages?

Yes, there is no limitation. However you’d better not set more than one email to be sent at the same number of days after user registration.

### Can I send emails through SMTP?

Yes. Just install any of the available free SMTP plugins for WordPress. We recommend WP Mail SMTP, Postman SMTP or Easy WP SMTP. Arigato will automatically send all its emails through it.

No settings are required in Arigato for this. When your WordPress emails are sent through an SMTP plugin, Arigato emails will be sent through it as well. This is because Arigato routes its emails through the default WordPress mail() funciton. If you already use an SMTP plugin on your site, Arigato will use it automatically.

### Is there an unsubscribe link?

Yes, an unsubscribe link is automatically added to every outgoing message.

### What to do if it doesn’t send emails?

Please install a plugin like WP Mail SMTP or Easy WP SMTP and try to send a test email. If the test email isn’t received, it means the problem is not in the autoresponder and you should talk to your hosting support.

### Are there any limits to how many emails can be sent?

The autoresponder itself does not impose any limits, but your hosting company probably does. If you plan to have large mailing list, you will need the pro version because it lets you fine-tune the number of emails sent to comply with your hosting company limitations.

### Is this plugin GDPR compliant?

Arigato is just a tool and has a lot less to do with GDPR compliance than the way you use it. The plugin has always provided the necessary functions: there is unsubscribe link attached to every message so the users can delete their data. There is double opt-in feature which you can (and should) use. We have hooked a personal data eraser to the WordPress personal data eraser tool.

From then on, compliance depends on how you use the plugin:

* Be clear what the users are subscribing to and don’t send them anything else.
* Use the double opt-in feature.
* Never remove the unsubscribe link.
* Never provide your mailing list to someone else.
* The above information is not a legal advice and is not meant to be a complete GDPR guide. You should do your own research and decide what you can and can not use.

### How to change the text of the subscribe button or any other text generated by the plugin

You can change any texts using [Loco Translate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/ "Loco Translate")

### How to change the design of the signup form?

You can change the form design using CSS. If you want to do more changes, reorder the fields, etc, you can use the HTML form code and change it directly.

Forget the expensive pay-every-month autoresponders like Mailchimp, Aweber, and GetResponse! What you want to do is try out the Free version of Arigato to test it out and then buy Arigato Pro so you pay one time for full features and you’re done. It’s a robust program free of bugs and will do everything you need it to. I recommend you pair it with an email provider like Google’s G Suite (just $6/mo) that will allow you to send 10,000 emails daily so you can grow to that level painlessly, otherwise you will likely run afoul of your website’s hosting provider who’ll usually want you to throttle way back on the number of emails you can send.
Arigato works well with the free membership site plugin Konnichiwa!, also by Kiboko Labs. Both together also work well with the free User Registration plugin which replaces WordPress’ klunky native registration process to allow your users to choose their own passwords and keeps them out of your Admin area.
With Arigato Pro you get great tech support by Bob, who you’ll notice all the other reviewers just love, and for good reason. He helped me several times and was most helpful. Thanks Bob!

Downloaded this plugin for a client. Functionality was good, exactly what we were looking for. Everything worked, and using it was easy. Then came an update, both of WP and our theme. That led to some formatting issues with Arigato. So, I contacted “Bob” at support. Excellent service. Response was fast, and the explanations and solutions offered were quick and simple. Now, everything is working great AND looking great.

Found this, and immediately got rid of all 3rd party/PHP mailing list scripts. This is an absolutely feature jam packed autoresponder, all within WordPress! Even better, it can still use 3rd party SMTP like SendGrid.
Also finally gladly deleted ArpReach of our server (which happens to be 10x more powerful then any 3rd party hosted solution). Seriously who needs separate scripts, when one can contain it neatly within WordPress. Less hassle.
Yes, has typical (1) Immediate broadcast, (2) Timed newsletters (3) Autoresponder based on timed sequence; can set by time, date of week, etc. (4) Tons of template options. Can also track open rate and also link-clicks.
Surprised this has so few reviews. Seems hasn’t taken off. Wish more know about it.

We needed to set up 2 autoresponders with different messages depending on what the user clicked on. This solved all our issues, converted to CF7 simply AND we were able to see in our email what the user chose.
Bob was around for questions and helped me with great advice. Love this plugin! Saved a ton of time instead of setting up accounts at the big email houses.
I wish all plugins were this easy. By far the best choice for autoresponders!

I purchased the Arigato Pro version over 3 years ago after using the free version. I’ve tested popular autoresponders including the Aweber, GetResponse, Mailchimp and some plugins. I’ve tested them all and Arigato Autoresponder for Wordpress is the BEST.
Arigato for Wordpress is the Absolute Best Autoresponder for everyone. There are NO limits to number of emails or email lists you can build and it is NOT expensive like the big 3 or plugin like mailpoet which purchased from a crook and ditched after 3 months of NO customer support — it was then I discovered Arigato Pro for Wordpress and there’s no turning back, only building email lists — the money is in the list. And I get updates too.
