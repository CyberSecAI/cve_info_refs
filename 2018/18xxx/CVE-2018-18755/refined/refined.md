Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization, allowing for SQL injection. Specifically, the `user_group_id` and `user_id` parameters in the `admin/user/group/update` and `admin/user/user/update` routes are vulnerable.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized access to or modification of data.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Database Exposure: Attackers can extract sensitive data, including database names, table structures, and potentially user credentials or other confidential information.
    *   Data Manipulation: Successful injection can allow the attacker to modify or delete data within the database.
    *   Privilege Escalation: In some cases, attackers might use SQL injection to elevate their privileges within the application.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   HTTP GET parameters: The injection occurs through GET requests targeting specific routes (`admin/user/group/update` and `admin/user/user/update`) by manipulating the `user_group_id` and `user_id` parameters, respectively.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
    *   Knowledge of vulnerable parameters: The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable routes and parameters (`user_group_id` and `user_id`).

**Technical Details:**

The exploit examples provided show SQL injection attempts within the `user_group_id` and `user_id` parameters:
