    "ID": "CVE-2018-18544",
    "content": "The provided documents discuss a memory leak vulnerability in the `WriteMSLImage` function of `coders/msl.c` in ImageMagick 7.0.8-13 Q16 and the `ProcessMSLScript` function in GraphicsMagick before 1.3.31.\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from a memory leak in the aforementioned functions within the ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick libraries. Specifically, resources are allocated but not properly released leading to memory leaks when handling certain malformed image files.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Memory Leak:** The `WriteMSLImage` and `ProcessMSLScript` functions fail to free allocated memory when handling certain input, resulting in a memory leak. This can lead to increased memory consumption and potentially denial of service.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation can lead to a denial of service condition, especially in cases where the vulnerable software is processing a large volume of malicious image files. The continued memory leak can cause the system to run out of memory eventually causing the system or the specific application to crash.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network:** A remote attacker could exploit this by sending a specially crafted file to a server or service using ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick for processing. \n- **Local:** A local user can trigger the vulnerability by processing a malicious file using a vulnerable tool.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious file for processing by ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick. This can be achieved through network or local means. \n- No authentication is required.\n- User interaction may or may not be required depending on the specific use case.",
