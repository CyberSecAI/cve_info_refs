{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The module loading implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly enforce signed module loading when booted with UEFI Secure Boot in some situations.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The kernel was not using the secondary keyring for verifying module signatures, where the MOK keys are stored.",
      "The kernel was not enforcing that modules must be signed when under lockdown, allowing modules to load even if signature verification failed."
    ],
    "impact": "A local privileged attacker could load unsigned or maliciously signed kernel modules, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the kernel.",
    "attack_vectors": "Loading a malicious kernel module via the finit_module(2) syscall.",
    "required_capabilities": "Local privileged access (root) to load kernel modules."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "config_options": "The vulnerability is present when the kernel is configured with CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_FORCE=n, CONFIG_IMA_APPRAISE=y, and without using the built-in IMA secure_boot policy snippet.",
      "masking_bug": "The first bug (not using secondary keyring) was masked by the second bug (not enforcing signed modules).",
        "affected_os":"Ubuntu 18.10"
