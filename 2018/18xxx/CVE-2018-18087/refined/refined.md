The content is related to CVE-2018-18087.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the "image URL" field and potentially the "title" field of a portfolio management system.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists because the application does not sanitize user-supplied input before rendering it in the context of a web page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML.
- This can lead to malicious actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker with "Manage portfolio" privileges can inject malicious code into the "image URL" field via the editor interface.
- The vulnerability is triggered when a user visits a specific portfolio page ( `/portfolio/${project_title}` ) which renders the injected payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a user account with "Manage portfolio" privileges.
