- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied value before it is dereferenced as a pointer within the KERedirect kext.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Untrusted pointer dereference.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the kernel, leading to privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors**: Local attacker with the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
