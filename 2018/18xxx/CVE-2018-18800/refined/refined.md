Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-18800:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by SQL injection in the "PayPal/Credit Card/Debit Card Payment 1.0" application.
*   The application directly uses user-supplied input (from `$_GET['q']` parameters) within SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. Specifically, the `accomodation.php` and `room_rates.php` files are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The code constructs SQL queries by directly concatenating user input, making it susceptible to manipulation by an attacker.
    *   In `accomodation.php`, the `$_GET['q']` parameter is used unsafely in a SQL query, specifically in line 50 and 55
    *   In `room_rates.php`, the `$_GET['q']` parameter is used unsafely in a SQL query on line 55

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially extract sensitive data from the database, including user information, payment details, and other confidential data.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The attacker could modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Although not explicitly mentioned, in some scenarios, SQL injection could lead to privilege escalation within the database if not properly secured.
*   **Application Downtime:**  An attacker could potentially cause denial of service by exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET requests:** The vulnerability is exploited via HTTP GET requests by injecting malicious SQL code into the `q` parameter of the `index.php` page, specifically when the `p` parameter is set to `accomodation` or `rooms`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Basic understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL to craft malicious payloads.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The provided exploit code suggests the attack can be performed without any prior authentication as it directly targets the web application's index page with crafted GET requests.

**Additional details**

* The provided exploit includes example SQL injection payloads that attempt to extract table and column names from the database using `UNION SELECT` statements and the `information_schema.columns` table.
*   The vulnerable files are `accomodation.php` and `room_rates.php`.
*   The application is built using PHP and the vulnerability exists due to lack of proper input validation/sanitization.
