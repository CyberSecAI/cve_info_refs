The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities found in the Contour Next One glucometer system, with one specifically identified as CVE-2018-18975.

**CVE-2018-18975:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Weak implementation of certificate pinning on the mobile application.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Bypassable certificate pinning
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Allows an attacker to intercept and modify communications between the mobile application and the backend server.
*   **Attack vectors:** Man-in-the-middle attack. The attacker needs to proxy communications between the mobile application and the backend servers.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to proxy network traffic, which would typically require a jailbroken or rooted mobile device and the use of a proxy tool like Burp Suite's Mobile Assistant.

**Additional Vulnerabilities (with their CVE IDs)**:
The document also details additional vulnerabilities that were part of the exploit chain that led to data tampering:

*   **CVE-2018-18976:** Insecure direct object reference (IDOR), allowing an attacker to enumerate other users' encrypted data.
*   **CVE-2018-18977:** Trivial obfuscation of the Android application code.
*   **CVE-2018-18978 & CVE-2018-18979:** Statically coded encryption key and initialization vector.

These additional vulnerabilities led to the following:

*   **Impact of exploitation:** The combination of these vulnerabilities allowed for the decryption of user data and subsequent modification of that data on the server.
*   **Attack vectors:** Exploitation of these vulnerabilities requires reverse engineering of the mobile app, interception of network traffic, and use of custom scripts to decrypt, modify, and re-encrypt the traffic.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs reverse engineering skills, a rooted mobile device to access the application code and network interception capabilities, as well as the ability to write scripts to perform the necessary encryption/decryption.

The combined exploitation of these vulnerabilities allowed the researchers to:
*   Enumerate all users' encrypted data.
*   Decrypt user data.
*   Modify user data, including personal information and, theoretically, glucose level readings.

The report notes that the vendor fixed the vulnerabilities within a 90-day responsible disclosure period.
