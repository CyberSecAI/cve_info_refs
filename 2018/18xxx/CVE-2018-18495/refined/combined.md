Steps to reproduce:
The fix for this issue [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1468523](/show_bug.cgi?id=1468523 "VERIFIED FIXED - Stealing of URL cross-domain using performance.getEntries() once again, treat meta refresh channel as a redirect by setting result principal URL") has correctly addressed, we can not reproduce by changing the location using a meta-refresh.
It alerts "<http://pwning.click/con.html>" when we run this inside a frame, which is expected result.
Test live on: <http://pwning.click/redirffeg.html>
However, we can reproduce this issue by changing its location using JavaScript location property. Note that the page need to run inside a frame.

Taking the bug from Dragana after a F2F discussion.
The check whether to add an entry (a channel) to a perf storage is made at [1]. I would expect we get blocked there, but we don't. The story is way different.
Taking the redirffeg2.html PoC and serving it locally to have a control over it, I ran the following tests and monitored load info and loading doc of each channel that tried to add itself at [1].
Test #1, the PoC for this bug, location="":
"<http://test.local/bugs/1487964/ffredirtest.html>"
- innerWindow=0x00000228c56be820,
- perf=0x00000228c62a6000,
- mLoadInfo->TP=0x00000228bab6138c "<http://test.local/bugs/1487964/redirffeg2.html>"
- loadingDoc->NP=0x00000228bab6138c "<http://test.local/bugs/1487964/redirffeg2.html>"
"<http://test.local/bugs/1487964/ffloctest.html>"
- innerWindow=0x00000228bd173020,
- perf=0x00000228c6281000,
- mLoadInfo->TP=0x00000228c62e260c "<http://test.local/bugs/1487964/ffredirtest.html>",
- loadingDoc->NP=0x00000228c62e260c "<http://test.local/bugs/1487964/ffredirtest.html>"
"<https://www.bing.com/search?q=test>"
- innerWindow=0x00000228bd173020,
- perf=0x00000228c6281000,
- mLoadInfo->TP=0x00000228c62e808c "<http://test.local/bugs/1487964/ffloctest.html>",
- loadingDoc->NP=0x00000228c62e260c "<http://test.local/bugs/1487964/ffredirtest.html>"
Note that the last entry's innerWindow and perf (=mozilla::dom::Performance) are the same object as for the ffloctest.html load (the one with <script>location="...").
Hence according the (for me kinda disputable) check at [1] this is not cross origin at all.
Test #2, meta refresh:
just a single entry in the list, but 3 are trying (and passing the check at [1]!) to be added. The listing looks exactly the same as for the above test. But the difference in the result (=no-leak) is that we are adding the entries using the originalURI of the channel - which in the case of a meta refresh is "<http://test.local/bugs/1487964/ffloctest.html>" for ffloctest.html and also for www.bing.com.
Test #3, 302 redirect:
"<http://test.local/bugs/1487964/ffredirtest.html>"
- innerWindow=0x00000228c56bb820,
- perf=0x00000228c624a000,
- mLoadInfo->TP=0x00000228bab6138c "<http://test.local/bugs/1487964/redirffeg2.html>",
- loadingDoc->NP=0x00000228bab6138c "<http://test.local/bugs/1487964/redirffeg2.html>"
"<https://www.bing.com/search?q=test>"
- innerWindow=0x00000228c39ca820,
- perf=0x00000228c5660000,
- mLoadInfo->TP=0x00000228c633e10c "<http://test.local/bugs/1487964/ffredirtest.html>",
- loadingDoc->NP=0x00000228c633e10c "<http://test.local/bugs/1487964/ffredirtest.html>"
Only two entries are trying to add themselves, because the ffloctest.html channel doesn't get a chance to be added (OnStopRequest is never called for a redirected HttpChannelChild, this may be different with e10s off!) And, as we are adding using the originalURL, it will show up as "<http://test.local/bugs/1487964/ffloctest.html>" in the performance entries listing, but is actually for the "bing.com" load.
[Bug 1185256](/show_bug.cgi?id=1185256 "RESOLVED FIXED - performance.getEntries() shows x-domain URLs after a redirect when loading from cache") fixed redirects for back/forward nav and session restore by correct propagation of the originalURL between the channels through docshell.
[Bug 1468523](/show_bug.cgi?id=1468523 "VERIFIED FIXED - Stealing of URL cross-domain using performance.getEntries() once again, treat meta refresh channel as a redirect by setting result principal URL") fixed regression from combination of that bug and [bug 1319111](/show_bug.cgi?id=1319111 "RESOLVED FIXED - Expose result principal URL (\"final channel URL\") on LoadInfo, convert current consumers of LOAD_REPLACE") by correctly setting the result principal URI on the meta refresh target channel.
I don't think we want to treat location=".." assignment as a redirect. We want to treat it as a navigation - right? We do treat meta refresh as a redirect, though.
To sum - I'm not sure what exactly to do here. I am also not sure what resources should be visible in the entries list and which not. If a page loads a cross-origin script, should it be visible to the page? (assuming yes) If that page is iframe-ed, should parent see its cross origin resources? Should parent see any resource of the iframe-ed page? (no idea)
Based on answers, I think the check at [1] should be changed or enhanced.

Note that the check at [1] from [comment 5](/show_bug.cgi?id=1487964#c5 "VERIFIED FIXED - Cross-Origin URL Steal is possible using performance.getEntries()") comes from [bug 1408990](/show_bug.cgi?id=1408990 "VERIFIED FIXED - Resource Timing API leaks URL after subframe navigation").

I hope I got the Gecko terminology correct here: inner windows (WindowProxy in the HTML Standard) are best not compared as they're shared across multiple outer windows (the Window object; where you want to make security checks on or on its associated document).
However, from <https://w3c.github.io/performance-timeline/#getentries-method-0> and also <https://w3c.github.io/navigation-timing/> it's not clear to me why these PerformanceEntry objects would ever be created for a different global. I'm guessing that's happening here because the <embed> initial load is done in the load group (fetch group in the standard, but basically not defined) of the parent and only once a docshell (browsing context) is created, does it get moved. So presumably something is messed up there, coupled with the fact that none of this is defined properly and performance timing isn't even grounded in terms of Fetch, despite us complaining about that for years...Flags: needinfo?(annevk)

> I hope I got the Gecko terminology correct here
You have it backwards. Inner windows are Window; outer windows are WindowProxy.
Past that, my take is that in fact figuring out what should be happening with resource timing is more or less impossible and we should disable the API altogether until the working group addresses that. In particular, the lack of a processing model makes it hard to answer basic questions like "when a load is being done in an <embed>, what global's resource timing list should be used in which cases and why"?
To answer the specific questions from [comment 5](/show_bug.cgi?id=1487964#c5 "VERIFIED FIXED - Cross-Origin URL Steal is possible using performance.getEntries()"):
> I don't think we want to treat location=".." assignment as a redirect.
Correct. When the location="..." set happens in the <embed>, the triggering principal should be whatever started the load. That part is correct in the information in [comment 5](/show_bug.cgi?id=1487964#c5 "VERIFIED FIXED - Cross-Origin URL Steal is possible using performance.getEntries()"). A location set is \_not\_ a redirect, so the originalURI should not stay the same across it. In any case, I suspect that replacing that location set by <a href> probably has the same behavior.
> To sum - I'm not sure what exactly to do here. I am also not sure what resources
> should be visible in the entries list and which not.
Yep. Neither is anyone else, which is why i think we should disable the API.
What happens if the <embed> is replaced by <iframe>? Does the behavior stay the same? That is, is this a general "loads of a new document in a child browsing context are treated as subresources of the parent page" issue, or is there something <embed>-specific there? I'm pretty sure this came up before, but I don't recall what the decision was about what the right behavior here is (again, the spec doesn't really say) or whether that decision got implemented.
> If a page loads a cross-origin script, should it be visible to the page?
The URL the page started loading should be. If there are redirects they should not show up.
> Should parent see any resource of the iframe-ed page?
For subresources, no. For navigations in the iframe, unclear.Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky) → needinfo?(past)

My understanding, and please correct me if I'm wrong, is that we don't know how to fix this bug because we don't know how to do so while remaining spec-compliant. I can drive this discussion in the working group, but can someone more familiar with these details than me file a spec issue?

Ideally we wouldn't provide any unnecessary details that could lead to an exploit before we get a chance to fix this.

|  | |

The summary of the situation as I see it is:
1) We can't tell whether we're spec-compliant now or not, nor whether we would be after various fixes to this bug. This is due to the spec not having a well-defined processing model, and not having useful tests, as far as I can see.
2) We have had a significant number of security bugs in our implementation of this spec, due to the lack of clear definition of the processing model. As a result, instead of a single security analysis being done once, in the spec, every implementation has to do their own, and we haven't been able to devote sufficient resources to that.
3) The spec has informative text that is presumably intended to clarify things but seems to directly contradict the normative spec text.
The relevant spec here is resource-timing. I think we should disable all of it.

I'm aware of that. I just don't think we should keep shipping this given the longstanding lack of a spec and unwillingness on the part of the working group to fix that. If this API were coming up with an intent to ship right now, I would object to shipping it.

I see. Also, worth to note that Google and Apple fixed this issue by disabling performance.getEntriesByType("resource")[1], so it's always undefined when we use performance.getEntriesByType("resource")[1] on Google Chrome and Apple Safari. So this should be a correct fix for this issue as we can not trigger redirection / navigation tricks using getEntriesByType("resource")[1] anymore. It appears that Mozilla Firefox for Windows and Android doesn't have history back-forward navigation reveal problem too so this should resolve this problem.Flags: needinfo?(honzab.moz)Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

Btw, from the [comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=1487964#c9 "VERIFIED FIXED - Cross-Origin URL Steal is possible using performance.getEntries()") - "or is there something <embed>-specific there?", this is not embed specific, it's same behavior on Iframe and Object on Mozilla Firefox. In certain browsers yes, there is something embed specific. For example, we can reveal latest Cross-Origin URL continuously using history.back(); on Internet Explorer with embed because after back-forward navigation embed tag on Internet Explorer will save the latest updated page inside embed tag even after back-forward navigation. This doesn't happen when you use Iframe and Object, page inside a frame is resetted to Original URL. So that's browser specific behavior, but this does not include Mozilla Firefox, in fact it doesn't even allow to use back-forward navigation on Mozilla Firefox for Windows and Android.

Which allows us to use performance.getEntriesByType("resource")[1] but being not able to read url anymore. Thus, redirection / navigation tricks can't be triggered anymore.

The screenshot I was sent just shows that performance.getEntriesByType("resource")[1] doesn't exist in Chrome. The question is whether performance.getEntriesByType("resource")[0] exists and if so what its .name is.
In general, the really interesting thing is to stop poking at specific indices or types and just look at
Array.prototype.slice.call(performance.getEntries()).map((e) => e.name)
which will give you all the URLs you can get out via the performance timing APIs. In this case, at least in Chrome, you can see that the history navigation is not showing up in the list at all.Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

I guess you could do it even more simply in browsers that support webidl iterator bits (which might be all of them now):
performance.getEntries().map(e => e.name)

yes, performance.getEntriesByType("resource")[0] exists in Chrome (and all other browsers that supports resource timing API) and its name returns the URL before the redirection, so Cross-Origin URL reveal issue not possible at least with these tricks. Although, Chrome allowed history navigation as I mentioned before, so one could continuously reveal the Cross-Origin URL. This was fixed on Chrome 70 update yesterday.

Hey Valentin, I think there is a semantic bug in the current implementation, in particular here [1]:
> if (!mLoadInfo->TriggeringPrincipal()->Equals(loadingDocument->NodePrincipal())) {
> return nullptr;
> }
That will only add same-origin loads to the docoument's performance entries, but for iframe loads you are comparing the triggeringPrincipal with the NodePrincipal of the iframe document not the parent document.
I guess in the iframe case we want to compare the triggeringPrincipal with the loadingDocument->GetParentDocument()->NodePrincipal.
What do you think?

Valentin, I see you are setting a bit in the loadinfo, but you don't serialize that bit in BackgroundUtils (somewhere around here [1]). To avoid additional problems, that's probably worth doing - thanks!

Thanks for pointing that out. I fixed it in the latest revision, if you care to take a look.
Is there a way of making the serialization future-proof? Maybe a static\_assert regarding the size of LoadInfo, so that it fails if any new members are added?Flags: needinfo?(valentin.gosu)

Thanks for incorporating that change. I agree, current practice of manually adding serialization code to BackgroundUtils.cpp and hoping that people don't forget to do that is not very bullet proof. FWIW, I filed [Bug 1506108](/show_bug.cgi?id=1506108 "NEW - Investigate if we can be smarter when serializing a Loadinfo") to investigate if we can add some guards to make it harder to shoot ourselves in the foot.

Taking [Comment #42](/show_bug.cgi?id=1487964#c42 "VERIFIED FIXED - Cross-Origin URL Steal is possible using performance.getEntries()") into consideration I have talked to Valentin Gosu and got the list of bugs that need verifying in order for this bug to be considered verified fixed. The list is:
- [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1468523](/show_bug.cgi?id=1468523 "VERIFIED FIXED - Stealing of URL cross-domain using performance.getEntries() once again, treat meta refresh channel as a redirect by setting result principal URL")
- [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1254688](/show_bug.cgi?id=1254688 "RESOLVED FIXED - Resource Timing API is storing resources sent by the previous page.")
- [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1408990](/show_bug.cgi?id=1408990 "VERIFIED FIXED - Resource Timing API leaks URL after subframe navigation")
None of these were affected by the fix to this bug, so I consider this issue to be VERIFIED FIXED for firefox 64 and 65.

You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.

* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8939358&action=edit)

I noticed an unusual permission warning when first visiting about: pages with an extension installed.
> Error: Permission denied to access property "defaultOptions" defaults.js:1:1
By looking at the loaded moz-extension:// sources in Browser Toolbox I noticed that content scripts were being loaded as background scripts on visiting an about: page. It only happens with manifests that have both "match\_about\_blank" and "run\_at" "document\_start". "matches" does not seem to make any difference. The about: page must be visited for the first time in that window and it does not happen with about:blank.
I modified the manifest of the Borderify example extension and attached it as a test case.
STR:
1. Install modified Borderify extension.
2. Open Browser Toolbox, go to Debugger and note moz-extension:// list of sources.
3. Create a new window and visit about:about.
4. Note borderify.js in list of moz-extension:// sources despite it being a content script.
I'm unsure of security implications so marking this as hidden just in case.

Can you explain what you mean by "loaded as background scripts"? If this is just about how the scripts appear in devtools, this should be moved to a devtools component and made public, its not clear to me if you're reporting something else however...Flags: needinfo?(kestrel)

[match\_about\_blank\_test-1.0.zip](attachment.cgi?id=8940499)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8940499&action=edit)

The content script is being loaded in about:blank before the destination about: page is loaded, if the destination is in the main process then the script is also loaded in the main process. This can be observed by putting an infinite loop in the script and monitoring which process shows high CPU usage. Content scripts being loaded in to the main process undermines process sandboxing and the script can interfere with the loading of important about: pages, delaying or redirecting them.
The script still appears to be sandboxed as a content script, limited to WE APIs and CSP is not blocking eval(). It remains in the main process after uninstallation so restarting the browser is usually required between tests.
Attempting to breakpoint the script causes a crash:
> MOZ\_RELEASE\_ASSERT(js::SavedFrame::isSavedFrameOrWrapperAndNotProto(\*stack))
Accessing a variable in another script file produces a permission error (it doesn't happen with very small script files, I had to pad the script with text for this to appear).
> Error: Permission denied to access property "defaultOption" defaults.js:1:1
If it contains browser.storage.onChanged.addListener it produces an error for about:blank pages regardless of which process it gets loaded into:
> Error: WebExtension context not found! ExtensionParent.jsm:863:13
Attached is an example extension demonstrating the above errors.

I think in general we want to stop loading content pages in the parent process, but until that's true, we can probably do something locally for content scripts.
Hopefully this doesn't impact system addons, though I'm afraid one of PDF.js or reader view is still in the parent process.Assignee: nobody → tomica

IMO this bug doesn't look like sec-crit or sec-high, and Kris agrees.
Given that, I will probably want to push a patch for this to Try, to suss out all the possible corner cases this change might break. Obviously, I'll find or file an innocent looking bug to disguise as.
Let me know if anyone disagrees or objects.

Call it a low "sec-moderate" because it's violating our sandbox policies, but for bad things to happen the user has installed a malicious extension (that can already do bad data-stealing things to the user) and the WE has to have an RCE exploit. If that happens then this is a sandbox bypass.Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)Keywords: [sec-moderate](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-moderate&resolution=---)

So there are better ways to do this, but they require more intrusive changes (probably across c++ and js), and would be harder to make look innocuous in a public bug. We can land a better patch after this goes through release/ESR.
Also, I have manually verified this fixes the problem, but can't think of any way to write a test for it. :/

Resolving, this was fixed in [bug 1496532](/show_bug.cgi?id=1496532 "RESOLVED FIXED - Content script sometimes runs in pre-allocated new tab page") (and followup [bug 1498311](/show_bug.cgi?id=1498311 "RESOLVED FIXED - Fix extension isContentScriptProcess logic for platforms without oop extensions")).
Hey Ryan, I don't think we we're uplifting "low sec-moderate" to ESR, right? Anyway, this fix wouldn't even apply across all platforms since we only had OOP extensions on Windows in Firefox 60.
Also, we probably want to QA to verify this (they already asked in the public bugs).Flags: qe-verify?Flags: needinfo?(ryanvm)

We have some leeway for taking sec-moderate patches on ESR60 (note that ESR52 is already EOL, so we wouldn't be looking at any older releases), largely a matter of balancing the severity of the bug, the riskiness of the patch, and the long-term cost of leaving it unfixed on that branch (since ESR60 isn't EOL for roughly another year).
If in doubt, I'd run it past dveditz and see what he thinks. Thanks for the ping!Group: toolkit-core-security → core-security-release

Verified as fixed using Firefox 64(buildid 20181105164654) on Winsows 10x64 and macOS 10.13.6.
I also confirmed that issue was reproducible on earlier FF versions.Status: RESOLVED → VERIFIED

Thanks Victor!
Daniel, would you insist in uplifting this to ESR? I don't recommend it because:
1) it's low sec-moderate,
2) this fix is only possible on Windows for ESR (we didn't have OOP extensions on other platforms in 60),
2) and it's likely to break something unknown / that doesn't live in m-c / something enterprises might be doing.
This is generally a major change for some corner cases, and IMO somewhat risky, which is why I originally opted to do it in a public [bug 1496532](/show_bug.cgi?id=1496532 "RESOLVED FIXED - Content script sometimes runs in pre-allocated new tab page") (and it did evidently break on unexpected stuff even in m-c).Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)

Thanks for asking -- those are all good reasons not to take this fix on ESR.

# USN-3844-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

11 December 2018

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.10](/security/notices?release=cosmic)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service, bypass same-origin

restritions, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-12405](/security/CVE-2018-12405), [CVE-2018-12406](/security/CVE-2018-12406),

[CVE-2018-12407](/security/CVE-2018-12407), [CVE-2018-17466](/security/CVE-2018-17466), [CVE-2018-18492](/security/CVE-2018-18492), [CVE-2018-18493](/security/CVE-2018-18493),

[CVE-2018-18494](/security/CVE-2018-18494), [CVE-2018-18498](/security/CVE-2018-18498))

Multiple security issues were discovered in WebExtensions. If a user were

tricked in to installing a specially crafted extension, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to open privileged pages, or bypass other

security restrictions. ([CVE-2018-18495](/security/CVE-2018-18495), [CVE-2018-18497](/security/CVE-2018-18497))
