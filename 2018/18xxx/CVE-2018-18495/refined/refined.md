    "related": true,
    "summary": "WebExtension content scripts can be loaded into `about:` pages, violating the intended permissions of extensions.",
    "details": "WebExtension content scripts can be loaded into `about:` pages in some circumstances, in violation of the permissions granted to extensions. This could allow an extension to interfere with the loading and usage of these pages and use capabilities that were intended to be restricted from extensions.",
    "affected_versions": [
      "Firefox 64"
    ],
    "root_cause": "Content scripts with `match_about_blank` and `run_at` `document_start` are loaded in `about:` pages, which is not intended behavior.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "WebExtension content scripts are loaded into the main process when visiting `about:` pages, undermining process sandboxing.",
      "The content scripts can interfere with the loading of important `about:` pages, potentially delaying or redirecting them.",
        "WebExtensions content scripts can be loaded in `about:` pages."

    ],
     "impact": "An extension can interfere with the loading and usage of `about:` pages and use capabilities that were intended to be restricted from extensions. Malicious extensions could exploit this to interfere with browser functionality, delay page loads, or perform unauthorized actions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious web extension can use the `match_about_blank` and `run_at` options to execute content scripts in `about:` pages."
