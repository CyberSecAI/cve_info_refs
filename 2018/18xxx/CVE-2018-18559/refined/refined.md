  "CVE-2018-18559": {
    "description": "A use-after-free flaw can occur in the Linux kernel due to a race condition between packet_do_bind() and packet_notifier() functions called for an AF_PACKET socket. An unprivileged, local user could use this flaw to induce kernel memory corruption on the system, leading to an unresponsive system or to a crash. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out.",
    "vulnerability": "Use-after-free",
    "impact": "Kernel memory corruption, leading to an unresponsive system or crash. Potential for privilege escalation, but this is not fully confirmed.",
    "attack_vector": "Local access",
    "required_capabilities": "An unprivileged, local user"
