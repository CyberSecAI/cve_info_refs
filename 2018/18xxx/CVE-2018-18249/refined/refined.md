{
  "CVE-2018-18249": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the ability to inject PHP ini-file directives. This is achieved by using environment variables as a channel to transmit information to the attacker.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "PHP ini-file directive injection",
      "Unvalidated input from environment variables"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary PHP ini-file directives, potentially leading to:\n\n*   **Confidentiality Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information.\n*   **Integrity Impact:** Modification of application behavior.\n*   **Availability Impact:** Denial-of-service or application malfunction.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Network based attacks",
      "HTTP requests to /icingaweb2/navigation/add or /icingaweb2/dashboard/new-dashlet with crafted name parameters"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected endpoints and control environment variables.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered via crafted parameters sent to  /icingaweb2/navigation/add or /icingaweb2/dashboard/new-dashlet. The parameter `name` can be manipulated to include environment variables, like `${PATH}\_${APACHE\_RUN\_DIR}\_${APACHE\_RUN\_USER}`, allowing the injection of PHP ini-file directives."
