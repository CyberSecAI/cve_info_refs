```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application lacks CSRF protection on two POST methods, which can be used to change the super administrator's username and password.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can change the super administrator's username and password, potentially gaining full control of the application.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts malicious HTML pages (poc1.html, poc2.html or poc.html) that, when opened by a logged-in super administrator, submit forged POST requests to change the username and password.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a logged-in super administrator into opening the malicious HTML page."
