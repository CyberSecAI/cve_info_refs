Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-18551:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the ServersCheck Monitoring Software, which allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into various parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The software has both reflected and persistent XSS vulnerabilities. Reflected XSS occurs when user-supplied input is immediately displayed on a page, while persistent XSS occurs when user-supplied input is stored and then displayed to other users. Multiple XSS entry points were discovered:
    *   `sensors.html` with the `status`, `type`, and `device` parameters
    *   `report.html` with the `location` parameter
    *    `group_delete.html` with the `group` parameter
    *   `report_save.html` with the `query` parameter
    *    `sensors.html` with the `location` parameter
    *   `floorplan_editor.html` through the `lat`, `lng`, and `location_name` parameters via `location_save.html`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation allows arbitrary code execution within the security context of the currently authenticated user. This could lead to:
*   Session hijacking.
*   Data theft.
*   Malware injection.
*   Defacement of the application.
*   Potentially unauthorized access to the monitoring system and network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Manipulation:** Attackers can craft malicious URLs containing JavaScript payloads within the vulnerable parameters, sending these links to victims.
*   **Stored Payload:** The persistent XSS via the floorplan parameters allow for the malicious script to be stored in the application, affecting all users viewing the injected data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to access the vulnerable application remotely.
*   **Social Engineering (for reflected XSS):** To exploit the reflected XSS vulnerabilities, the attacker might need to trick users into clicking on crafted URLs.
*   **Authenticated User (for persistent XSS):** To exploit the persistent XSS, the attacker needs to be able to interact with the software and insert the malicious payload to be viewed by others.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content includes multiple Proof-of-Concept (PoC) URLs demonstrating how to trigger the XSS vulnerabilities.
*   The issue was reported to the vendor, and a patch was released (v14.3.4) shortly after the notification.
* The vulnerability affects versions up to 14.3.3
