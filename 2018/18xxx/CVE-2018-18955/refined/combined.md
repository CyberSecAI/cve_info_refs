# USN-3836-2: Linux kernel (HWE) vulnerabilities

4 December 2018

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux-gcp](/security/cves?package=linux-gcp) - Linux kernel for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) systems
* [linux-hwe](/security/cves?package=linux-hwe) - Linux hardware enablement (HWE) kernel

## Details

USN-3836-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 18.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 18.04 LTS for Ubuntu

16.04 LTS.

Jann Horn discovered that the Linux kernel mishandles mapping UID or GID

ranges inside nested user namespaces in some situations. A local attacker

could use this to bypass access controls on resources outside the

namespace. ([CVE-2018-18955](/security/CVE-2018-18955))

Philipp Wendler discovered that the overlayfs implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly verify the directory contents permissions from

within a unprivileged user namespace. A local attacker could use this to

expose sensitive information (protected file names). ([CVE-2018-6559](/security/CVE-2018-6559))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-42-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-42.45~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.15.0-42.45~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-42-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-42.45~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.15.0-42.45~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-42-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-42.45~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.15.0-42.45~16.04.1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Description

In the Linux kernel 4.15.x through 4.19.x before 4.19.2, map\_write() in kernel/user\_namespace.c allows privilege escalation because it mishandles nested user namespaces with more than 5 UID or GID ranges. A user who has CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN in an affected user namespace can bypass access controls on resources outside the namespace, as demonstrated by reading /etc/shadow. This occurs because an ID transformation takes place properly for the namespaced-to-kernel direction but not for the kernel-to-namespaced direction.

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

There are quite some use cases where users run into the current limit for
{g,u}id mappings. Consider a user requesting us to map everything but 999, and
1001 for a given range of 1000000000 with a sub{g,u}id layout of:

some-user:100000:1000000000
some-user:999:1
some-user:1000:1
some-user:1001:1
some-user:1002:1

This translates to:

MAPPING-TYPE | CONTAINER |    HOST |     RANGE |
-------------|-----------|---------|-----------|
         uid |       999 |     999 |         1 |
         uid |      1001 |    1001 |         1 |
         uid |         0 | 1000000 |       999 |
         uid |      1000 | 1001000 |         1 |
         uid |      1002 | 1001002 | 999998998 |
------------------------------------------------
         gid |       999 |     999 |         1 |
         gid |      1001 |    1001 |         1 |
         gid |         0 | 1000000 |       999 |
         gid |      1000 | 1001000 |         1 |
         gid |      1002 | 1001002 | 999998998 |

which is already the current limit.

As discussed at LPC simply bumping the number of limits is not going to work
since this would mean that struct uid_gid_map won't fit into a single cache-line
anymore thereby regressing performance for the base-cases. The same problem
seems to arise when using a single pointer. So the idea is to use

struct uid_gid_extent {
	u32 first;
	u32 lower_first;
	u32 count;
};

struct uid_gid_map { /* 64 bytes -- 1 cache line */
	u32 nr_extents;
	union {
		struct uid_gid_extent extent[UID_GID_MAP_MAX_BASE_EXTENTS];
		struct {
			struct uid_gid_extent *forward;
			struct uid_gid_extent *reverse;
		};
	};
};

For the base cases we will only use the struct uid_gid_extent extent member. If
we go over UID_GID_MAP_MAX_BASE_EXTENTS mappings we perform a single 4k
kmalloc() which means we can have a maximum of 340 mappings
(340 * size(struct uid_gid_extent) = 4080). For the latter case we use two
pointers "forward" and "reverse". The forward pointer points to an array sorted
by "first" and the reverse pointer points to an array sorted by "lower_first".
We can then perform binary search on those arrays.

Performance Testing:
When Eric introduced the extent-based struct uid_gid_map approach he measured
the performanc impact of his idmap changes:

> My benchmark consisted of going to single user mode where nothing else was
> running. On an ext4 filesystem opening 1,000,000 files and looping through all
> of the files 1000 times and calling fstat on the individuals files. This was
> to ensure I was benchmarking stat times where the inodes were in the kernels
> cache, but the inode values were not in the processors cache. My results:

> v3.4-rc1:         ~= 156ns (unmodified v3.4-rc1 with user namespace support disabled)
> v3.4-rc1-userns-: ~= 155ns (v3.4-rc1 with my user namespace patches and user namespace support disabled)
> v3.4-rc1-userns+: ~= 164ns (v3.4-rc1 with my user namespace patches and user namespace support enabled)

I used an identical approach on my laptop. Here's a thorough description of what
I did. I built a 4.14.0-rc4 mainline kernel with my new idmap patches applied. I
booted into single user mode and used an ext4 filesystem to open/create
1,000,000 files. Then I looped through all of the files calling fstat() on each
of them 1000 times and calculated the mean fstat() time for a single file. (The
test program can be found below.)

Here are the results. For fun, I compared the first version of my patch which
scaled linearly with the new version of the patch:

|   # MAPPINGS |   PATCH-V1 | PATCH-NEW |
|--------------|------------|-----------|
|   0 mappings |     158 ns |   158 ns  |
|   1 mappings |     164 ns |   157 ns  |
|   2 mappings |     170 ns |   158 ns  |
|   3 mappings |     175 ns |   161 ns  |
|   5 mappings |     187 ns |   165 ns  |
|  10 mappings |     218 ns |   199 ns  |
|  50 mappings |     528 ns |   218 ns  |
| 100 mappings |     980 ns |   229 ns  |
| 200 mappings |    1880 ns |   239 ns  |
| 300 mappings |    2760 ns |   240 ns  |
| 340 mappings | not tested |   248 ns  |

Here's the test program I used. I asked Eric what he did and this is a more
"advanced" implementation of the idea. It's pretty straight-forward:

 			for (j = i; j >= 0; j--)
 				close(fd[j]);
 			exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
 		}
 	}

 	for (k = 0; k < 1000; k++) {

 				goto close_all;
 		}

 		ret = gettimeofday(&t2, NULL);
 		if (ret < 0)
 			goto close_all;

 		time_in_mcs = (1000000 * t2.tv_sec + t2.tv_usec) -
 			      (1000000 * t1.tv_sec + t1.tv_usec);

 		times[k] = (time_in_mcs * 1000) / 1000000;
 	}

 close_all:

 		close(fd[i]);

 	if (ret < 0)
 		exit(EXIT_FAILURE);

 	for (k = 0; k < 1000; k++) {
 		sum += times[k];
 	}

# CVE-2018-18955

| **Name** | CVE-2018-18955 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | In the Linux kernel 4.15.x through 4.19.x before 4.19.2, map\_write() in kernel/user\_namespace.c allows privilege escalation because it mishandles nested user namespaces with more than 5 UID or GID ranges. A user who has CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN in an affected user namespace can bypass access controls on resources outside the namespace, as demonstrated by reading /etc/shadow. This occurs because an ID transformation takes place properly for the namespaced-to-kernel direction but not for the kernel-to-namespaced direction. |

userns: also map extents in the reverse map to kernel IDsThe current logic first clones the extent array and sorts both copies, then
maps the lower IDs of the forward mapping into the lower namespace, but
doesn't map the lower IDs of the reverse mapping.
This means that code in a nested user namespace with >5 extents will see
incorrect IDs. It also breaks some access checks, like
inode\_owner\_or\_capable() and privileged\_wrt\_inode\_uidgid(), so a process
can incorrectly appear to be capable relative to an inode.
To fix it, we have to make sure that the "lower\_first" members of extents
in both arrays are translated; and we have to make sure that the reverse
map is sorted \*after\* the translation (since otherwise the translation can
break the sorting).
This is CVE-2018-18955.

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

userns: also map extents in the reverse map to kernel IDs

```
The current logic first clones the extent array and sorts both copies, then
maps the lower IDs of the forward mapping into the lower namespace, but
doesn't map the lower IDs of the reverse mapping.

This means that code in a nested user namespace with >5 extents will see
incorrect IDs. It also breaks some access checks, like
inode_owner_or_capable() and privileged_wrt_inode_uidgid(), so a process
can incorrectly appear to be capable relative to an inode.

To fix it, we have to make sure that the "lower_first" members of extents
in both arrays are translated; and we have to make sure that the reverse
map is sorted *after* the translation (since otherwise the translation can
break the sorting).

This is [CVE-2018-18955](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c6xj-3c77-g5rg "CVE-2018-18955").

##### About The Exploit Database

Ã

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as âGoogle Hackingâ was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnnyâs talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term âGoogledorkâ to refer
to âa foolish or inept person as revealed by Googleâ. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a âGoogle problemâ but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term âdorkâ became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and âdorksâ were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

* When it comes to understanding the configuration and management details of NSE and NVE,
  including deployment, certificates, onboard key management and more, the Power
  Guide is the key resource!

[ONTAP 9 Network Management
Guide](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/pdfs/sidebar/Network_management.pdf) - While
this guide provides vast elements surrounding ONTAP networking (IPv4, v6,
IPSpaces, and more), it also captures some key security elements such as
managing SVMs, protocol restrictions and firewall configuration in addition to
control plane elements such as DNS, SNMP, FIPS configuration, and MTU details.
The Network Management Guide also shows list of ports used in ONTAP, also
listed in the hardening guide.

[ONTAP 9 Manage administrator authentication and RBAC with the
CLI](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/authentication/)

* You can enable login accounts for ONTAP cluster administrators and storage virtual machine (SVM) administrators.
  You can also use role-based access control (RBAC) to define the capabilities of administrators.

[NFS Kerberos in ONTAP](https://www.netapp.com/pdf.html?item=/media/19384-tr-4616.pdf)

* How to configure NFS Kerberos support in ONTAP for Active Directory and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) clients.

  management and name mapping for multiprotocol NAS access in ONTAP.

[DS-3898: NetApp Storage Encryption and NetApp Volume
Encryption](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3898.pdf) - When it comes to
encryption at rest there are many questions about the capabilities. The NSE and
NVE Datasheet seeks to quell such questions by providing a comprehensive
understanding of what NSE is, what NVE is, use cases, and how they can be
leveraged individually or together for a true dual/double encryption solution.

[NetApp Storage Encryption
Datasheet](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3213-en.pdf) - The NSE Datasheet
provides a holistic overview of the NSE solution and use cases. If you have
ever wondered what NSE is, what we mean by self encrypting drives, or what
encryption algorithm is in use, this is the resource for you!

[NetApp Volume Encryption
Datasheet](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3899.pdf) - The NVE Datasheet
provides a holistic overview of the NVE solution and use cases. If you have
ever wondered what NVE is, or what encryption algorithm it uses, this is the
resource for you!

##### Ransomware

[The NetApp Solution for
Ransomware](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4572.pdf) - Ransomware wages war
on every environment. Being the custodians of one of the worldÃ¢ÂÂs most valuable
resources (data/information), itÃ¢ÂÂs imperative that we protect it. When it comes
to ransomware, this is your guide to addressing and remediating the threat.

[NetApp and Varonis ransomware white
paper](https://info.varonis.com/hubfs/docs/whitepapers/en/Varonis-Ransomware-Whitepaper-Netapp.pdf) -
As a companion to the NetApp Solution for Ransomware, we have partnered with
Varonis in addressing the advanced techniques around this threat. We have
discussed and captured the solution in this joint white paper.

#### Integration and Solutions Guides

As we continue to tout the key elements of security including key management,
we understand the challenges and value of timeliness as it applies to adoption
and deployment. Due to such challenges we provide integration guides where we
walk through the configuration/provisioning of Ã¢ÂÂkeyÃ¢ÂÂ elements such as key
managers, FPolicy, and other security laden integration solutions.

##### Key Management

[NetApp ONTAP 9 External Key Management: Vormetric Key Management Integration
Guide](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4618.pdf) - The Vormetric integration
guide for ONTAP 9 depicts how to provision the Vormetric (Thales) key manager
for use with ONTAP 9.

#### Compliance

Compliance continues to evolve and shape the manner in which we address the
organizationÃ¢ÂÂs of today and more importantly how we address securing the data.
Remember Security does not equal Compliance, but security does in fact aid in
addressing the challenge.

vga\_switcheroo: Fix missing gpu\_bound call at audio client registration
commit fc09ab7a767394f9ecdad84ea6e85d68b83c8e21 upstream.
The commit 37a3a98ef601 ("ALSA: hda - Enable runtime PM only for
discrete GPU") added a new ops gpu\_bound to be called when GPU gets
bound. The patch overlooked, however, that vga\_switcheroo\_enable() is
called only once at GPU is bound. When an audio client is registered
after that point, it would miss the gpu\_bound call. This leads to the
unexpected lack of runtime PM in HD-audio side.
For addressing that regression, just call gpu\_bound callback manually
at vga\_switcheroo\_register\_audio\_client() when the GPU was already
bound.

bpf: wait for running BPF programs when updating map-in-map
commit 1ae80cf31938c8f77c37a29bbe29e7f1cd492be8 upstream.
The map-in-map frequently serves as a mechanism for atomic
snapshotting of state that a BPF program might record. The current
implementation is dangerous to use in this way, however, since
userspace has no way of knowing when all programs that might have
retrieved the "old" value of the map may have completed.
This change ensures that map update operations on map-in-map map types
always wait for all references to the old map to drop before returning
to userspace.

userns: also map extents in the reverse map to kernel IDs
commit d2f007dbe7e4c9583eea6eb04d60001e85c6f1bd upstream.
The current logic first clones the extent array and sorts both copies, then
maps the lower IDs of the forward mapping into the lower namespace, but
doesn't map the lower IDs of the reverse mapping.
This means that code in a nested user namespace with >5 extents will see
incorrect IDs. It also breaks some access checks, like
inode\_owner\_or\_capable() and privileged\_wrt\_inode\_uidgid(), so a process
can incorrectly appear to be capable relative to an inode.
To fix it, we have to make sure that the "lower\_first" members of extents
in both arrays are translated; and we have to make sure that the reverse
map is sorted \*after\* the translation (since otherwise the translation can
break the sorting).
This is CVE-2018-18955.

Btrfs: fix use-after-free during inode eviction
commit 421f0922a2cfb0c75acd9746454aaa576c711a65 upstream.
At inode.c:evict\_inode\_truncate\_pages(), when we iterate over the
inode's extent states, we access an extent state record's "state" field
after we unlocked the inode's io tree lock. This can lead to a
use-after-free issue because after we unlock the io tree that extent
state record might have been freed due to being merged into another
adjacent extent state record (a previous inflight bio for a read
operation finished in the meanwhile which unlocked a range in the io
tree and cause a merge of extent state records, as explained in the
comment before the while loop added in commit 6ca0709756710 ("Btrfs: fix
hang during inode eviction due to concurrent readahead")).
Fix this by keeping a copy of the extent state's flags in a local
variable and using it after unlocking the io tree.

btrfs: move the dio\_sem higher up the callchain
commit c495144bc6962186feae31d687596d2472000e45 upstream.
We're getting a lockdep splat because we take the dio\_sem under the
log\_mutex. What we really need is to protect fsync() from logging an
extent map for an extent we never waited on higher up, so just guard the
whole thing with dio\_sem.

btrfs: fix insert\_reserved error handling
commit 80ee54bfe8a3850015585ebc84e8d207fcae6831 upstream.
We were not handling the reserved byte accounting properly for data
references. Metadata was fine, if it errored out the error paths would
free the bytes\_reserved count and pin the extent, but it even missed one
of the error cases. So instead move this handling up into
run\_one\_delayed\_ref so we are sure that both cases are properly cleaned
up in case of a transaction abort.

btrfs: only free reserved extent if we didn't insert it
commit 49940bdd57779c78462da7aa5a8650b2fea8c2ff upstream.
When we insert the file extent once the ordered extent completes we free
the reserved extent reservation as it'll have been migrated to the
bytes\_used counter. However if we error out after this step we'll still
clear the reserved extent reservation, resulting in a negative
accounting of the reserved bytes for the block group and space info.
Fix this by only doing the free if we didn't successfully insert a file
extent for this extent.

commit fb5c39d7a887108087de6ff93d3f326b01b4ef41 upstream.
max\_extent\_size is supposed to be the largest contiguous range for the
space info, and ctl->free\_space is the total free space in the block
group. We need to keep track of these separately and \_only\_ use the
max\_free\_space if we don't have a max\_extent\_size, as that means our
original request was too large to search any of the block groups for and
therefore wouldn't have a max\_extent\_size set.

This is because at write\_one\_cache\_group() when we are COWing a leaf from
the extent tree we end up allocating a new block group (chunk) and,
because we have hit a threshold on the number of bytes reserved for system
chunks, we attempt to finalize the creation of new block groups from the
current transaction, by calling btrfs\_create\_pending\_block\_groups().
However here we also need to modify the extent tree in order to insert
a block group item, and if the location for this new block group item
happens to be in the same leaf that we were COWing earlier, we deadlock
since btrfs\_search\_slot() tries to write lock the extent buffer that we
locked before at write\_one\_cache\_group().
We have already hit similar cases in the past and commit d9a0540a79f8
("Btrfs: fix deadlock when finalizing block group creation") fixed some
of those cases by delaying the creation of pending block groups at the
known specific spots that could lead to a deadlock. This change reworks
that commit to be more generic so that we don't have to add similar logic
to every possible path that can lead to a deadlock. This is done by
making \_\_btrfs\_cow\_block() disallowing the creation of new block groups
(setting the transaction's can\_flush\_pending\_bgs to false) before it
attempts to allocate a new extent buffer for either the extent, chunk or
device trees, since those are the trees that pending block creation
modifies. Once the new extent buffer is allocated, it allows creation of
pending block groups to happen again.
This change depends on a recent patch from Josef which is not yet in
Linus' tree, named "btrfs: make sure we create all new block groups" in
order to avoid occasional warnings at btrfs\_trans\_release\_chunk\_metadata().

Btrfs: fix assertion on fsync of regular file when using no-holes feature
commit 7ed586d0a8241e81d58c656c5b315f781fa6fc97 upstream.
When using the NO\_HOLES feature and logging a regular file, we were
expecting that if we find an inline extent, that either its size in RAM
(uncompressed and unenconded) matches the size of the file or if it does
not, that it matches the sector size and it represents compressed data.
This assertion does not cover a case where the length of the inline extent
is smaller than the sector size and also smaller the file's size, such
case is possible through fallocate. Example:
$ mkfs.btrfs -f -O no-holes /dev/sdb
$ mount /dev/sdb /mnt
$ xfs\_io -f -c "pwrite -S 0xb60 0 21" /mnt/foobar
$ xfs\_io -c "falloc 40 40" /mnt/foobar
$ xfs\_io -c "fsync" /mnt/foobar
In the above example we trigger the assertion because the inline extent's
length is 21 bytes while the file size is 80 bytes. The fallocate() call
merely updated the file's size and did not touch the existing inline
extent, as expected.
So fix this by adjusting the assertion so that an inline extent length
smaller than the file size is valid if the file size is smaller than the
filesystem's sector size.
A test case for fstests follows soon.

Btrfs: fix null pointer dereference on compressed write path error
commit 3527a018c00e5dbada2f9d7ed5576437b6dd5cfb upstream.
At inode.c:compress\_file\_range(), under the "free\_pages\_out" label, we can
end up dereferencing the "pages" pointer when it has a NULL value. This
case happens when "start" has a value of 0 and we fail to allocate memory
for the "pages" pointer. When that happens we jump to the "cont" label and
then enter the "if (start == 0)" branch where we immediately call the
cow\_file\_range\_inline() function. If that function returns 0 (success
creating an inline extent) or an error (like -ENOMEM for example) we jump
to the "free\_pages\_out" label and then access "pages[i]" leading to a NULL
pointer dereference, since "nr\_pages" has a value greater than zero at
that point.
Fix this by setting "nr\_pages" to 0 when we fail to allocate memory for
the "pages" pointer.

Before rescan we call qgroup\_rescan\_zero\_tracking() to zero out all
qgroups' accounting numbers.
However we don't mark all qgroups dirty, but rely on rescan to do so.
If we have any high level qgroup without children, it won't be marked
dirty during rescan, since we cannot reach that qgroup.
This will cause QGROUP\_INFO items of childless qgroups never get updated
in the quota tree, thus their numbers will stay the same in "btrfs
qgroup show" output.
[FIX]
Just mark all qgroups dirty in qgroup\_rescan\_zero\_tracking(), so even if
we have childless qgroups, their QGROUP\_INFO items will still get
updated during rescan.

Btrfs: fix wrong dentries after fsync of file that got its parent replaced
commit 0f375eed92b5a407657532637ed9652611a682f5 upstream.
In a scenario like the following:
mkdir /mnt/A # inode 258
mkdir /mnt/B # inode 259
touch /mnt/B/bar # inode 260
sync
mv /mnt/B/bar /mnt/A/bar
mv -T /mnt/A /mnt/B
fsync /mnt/B/bar
After replaying the log we end up with file bar having 2 hard links, both
with the name 'bar' and one in the directory with inode number 258 and the
other in the directory with inode number 259. Also, we end up with the
directory inode 259 still existing and with the directory inode 258 still
named as 'A', instead of 'B'. In this scenario, file 'bar' should only
have one hard link, located at directory inode 258, the directory inode
259 should not exist anymore and the name for directory inode 258 should
be 'B'.
This incorrect behaviour happens because when attempting to log the old
parents of an inode, we skip any parents that no longer exist. Fix this
by forcing a full commit if an old parent no longer exists.
A test case for fstests follows soon.

Btrfs: fix warning when replaying log after fsync of a tmpfile
commit f2d72f42d5fa3bf33761d9e47201745f624fcff5 upstream.
When replaying a log which contains a tmpfile (which necessarily has a

This happens because the inode does not have the flag I\_LINKABLE set,
which is a runtime only flag, not meant to be persisted, set when the
inode is created through open(2) if the flag O\_EXCL is not passed to it.
Except for the warning, there are no other consequences (like corruptions
or metadata inconsistencies).
Since it's pointless to replay a tmpfile as it would be deleted in a
later phase of the log replay procedure (it has a link count of 0), fix
this by not logging tmpfiles and if a tmpfile is found in a log (created
by a kernel without this change), skip the replay of the inode.
A test case for fstests follows soon.

btrfs: make sure we create all new block groups
commit 545e3366db823dc3342ca9d7fea803f829c9062f upstream.
Allocating new chunks modifies both the extent and chunk tree, which can
trigger new chunk allocations. So instead of doing list\_for\_each\_safe,
just do while (!list\_empty()) so we make sure we don't exit with other
pending bg's still on our list.

If we're allocating a new space cache inode it's likely going to be

order to avoid deadlocks, and more importantly lockdep messages that

Btrfs: don't clean dirty pages during buffered writes
commit 7703bdd8d23e6ef057af3253958a793ec6066b28 upstream.
During buffered writes, we follow this basic series of steps:
again:
lock all the pages
wait for writeback on all the pages
Take the extent range lock
wait for ordered extents on the whole range
clean all the pages
if (copy\_from\_user\_in\_atomic() hits a fault) {
drop our locks
goto again;
}
dirty all the pages
release all the locks
The extra waiting, cleaning and locking are there to make sure we don't
modify pages in flight to the drive, after they've been crc'd.
If some of the pages in the range were already dirty when the write
began, and we need to goto again, we create a window where a dirty page
has been cleaned and unlocked. It may be reclaimed before we're able to
lock it again, which means we'll read the old contents off the drive and
lose any modifications that had been pending writeback.
We don't actually need to clean the pages. All of the other locking in
place makes sure we don't start IO on the pages, so we can just leave
them dirty for the duration of the write.

btrfs: wait on caching when putting the bg cache
commit 3aa7c7a31c26321696b92841d5103461c6f3f517 upstream.
While testing my backport I noticed there was a panic if I ran
generic/416 generic/417 generic/418 all in a row. This just happened to
uncover a race where we had outstanding IO after we destroy all of our
workqueues, and then we'd go to queue the endio work on those free'd
workqueues.
This is because we aren't waiting for the caching threads to be done
before freeing everything up, so to fix this make sure we wait on any
outstanding caching that's being done before we free up the block group,
so we're sure to be done with all IO by the time we get to
btrfs\_stop\_all\_workers(). This fixes the panic I was seeing
consistently in testing.

btrfs: keep trim from interfering with transaction commits
commit fee7acc361314df6561208c2d3c0882d663dd537 upstream.
Commit 499f377f49f08 (btrfs: iterate over unused chunk space in FITRIM)
fixed free space trimming, but introduced latency when it was running.
This is due to it pinning the transaction using both a incremented
refcount and holding the commit root sem for the duration of a single
trim operation.
This was to ensure safety but it's unnecessary. We already hold the the
chunk mutex so we know that the chunk we're using can't be allocated
while we're trimming it.
In order to check against chunks allocated already in this transaction,
we need to check the pending chunks list. To to that safely without
joining the transaction (or attaching than then having to commit it) we
need to ensure that the dev root's commit root doesn't change underneath
us and the pending chunk lists stays around until we're done with it.
We can ensure the former by holding the commit root sem and the latter
by pinning the transaction. We do this now, but the critical section
covers the trim operation itself and we don't need to do that.
This patch moves the pinning and unpinning logic into helpers and unpins
the transaction after performing the search and check for pending
chunks.
Limiting the critical section of the transaction pinning improves the
latency substantially on slower storage (e.g. image files over NFS).

btrfs: don't attempt to trim devices that don't support it
commit 0be88e367fd8fbdb45257615d691f4675dda062f upstream.
We check whether any device the file system is using supports discard in
the ioctl call, but then we attempt to trim free extents on every device
regardless of whether discard is supported. Due to the way we mask off
EOPNOTSUPP, we can end up issuing the trim operations on each free range
on devices that don't support it, just wasting time.

device\_list\_mutex. The problem is that ->alloc\_list is protected by the
chunk mutex. We don't want to hold the chunk mutex over the trim of the
entire file system. Fortunately, the ->dev\_list list is protected by
the dev\_list mutex and while it will give us all devices, including
read-only devices, we already just skip the read-only devices. Then we
can continue to take and release the chunk mutex while scanning each
device.

btrfs: Ensure btrfs\_trim\_fs can trim the whole filesystem
commit 6ba9fc8e628becf0e3ec94083450d089b0dec5f5 upstream.
[BUG]
fstrim on some btrfs only trims the unallocated space, not trimming any
space in existing block groups.
[CAUSE]
Before fstrim\_range passed to btrfs\_trim\_fs(), it gets truncated to
range [0, super->total\_bytes). So later btrfs\_trim\_fs() will only be
able to trim block groups in range [0, super->total\_bytes).
While for btrfs, any bytenr aligned to sectorsize is valid, since btrfs
uses its logical address space, there is nothing limiting the location
where we put block groups.
For filesystem with frequent balance, it's quite easy to relocate all
block groups and bytenr of block groups will start beyond
super->total\_bytes.
In that case, btrfs will not trim existing block groups.
[FIX]
Just remove the truncation in btrfs\_ioctl\_fitrim(), so btrfs\_trim\_fs()
can get the unmodified range, which is normally set to [0, U64\_MAX].

btrfs: Enhance btrfs\_trim\_fs function to handle error better
commit 93bba24d4b5ad1e5cd8b43f64e66ff9d6355dd20 upstream.
Function btrfs\_trim\_fs() doesn't handle errors in a consistent way. If
error happens when trimming existing block groups, it will skip the
remaining blocks and continue to trim unallocated space for each device.
The return value will only reflect the final error from device trimming.
This patch will fix such behavior by:
1) Recording the last error from block group or device trimming
The return value will also reflect the last error during trimming.
Make developer more aware of the problem.
2) Continuing trimming if possible
If we failed to trim one block group or device, we could still try
the next block group or device.
3) Report number of failures during block group and device trimming
It would be less noisy, but still gives user a brief summary of
what's going wrong.
Such behavior can avoid confusion for cases like failure to trim the
first block group and then only unallocated space is trimmed.

btrfs: fix error handling in btrfs\_dev\_replace\_start
commit 5c06147128fbbdf7a84232c5f0d808f53153defe upstream.
When we fail to start a transaction in btrfs\_dev\_replace\_start, we leave
dev\_replace->replace\_start set to STARTED but clear ->srcdev and
->tgtdev. Later, that can result in an Oops in
btrfs\_dev\_replace\_progress when having state set to STARTED or SUSPENDED
implies that ->srcdev is valid.
Also fix error handling when the state is already STARTED or SUSPENDED
while starting. That, too, will clear ->srcdev and ->tgtdev even though
it doesn't own them. This should be an impossible case to hit since we
should be protected by the BTRFS\_FS\_EXCL\_OP bit being set. Let's add an
ASSERT there while we're at it.

btrfs: locking: Add extra check in btrfs\_init\_new\_buffer() to avoid deadlock
commit b72c3aba09a53fc7c1824250d71180ca154517a7 upstream.
[BUG]
For certain crafted image, whose csum root leaf has missing backref, if
we try to trigger write with data csum, it could cause deadlock with the
following kernel WARN\_ON():
WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 41 at fs/btrfs/locking.c:230 btrfs\_tree\_lock+0x3e2/0x400

kthread+0x180/0x1d0
ret\_from\_fork+0x35/0x40
[CAUSE]
That crafted image has missing backref for csum tree root leaf. And
when we try to allocate new tree block, since there is no
EXTENT/METADATA\_ITEM for csum tree root, btrfs consider it's free slot
and use it.
The extent tree of the image looks like:
Normal image | This fuzzed image
----------------------------------+--------------------------------
BG 29360128 | BG 29360128
One empty slot | One empty slot
29364224: backref to UUID tree | 29364224: backref to UUID tree
Two empty slots | Two empty slots
29376512: backref to CSUM tree | One empty slot (bad type) <<<
29380608: backref to D\_RELOC tree | 29380608: backref to D\_RELOC tree
... | ...
Since bytenr 29376512 has no METADATA/EXTENT\_ITEM, when btrfs try to
alloc tree block, it's an valid slot for btrfs.
And for finish\_ordered\_write, when we need to insert csum, we try to CoW
csum tree root.
By accident, empty slots at bytenr BG\_OFFSET, BG\_OFFSET + 8K,
BG\_OFFSET + 12K is already used by tree block COW for other trees, the
next empty slot is BG\_OFFSET + 16K, which should be the backref for CSUM
tree.
But due to the bad type, btrfs can recognize it and still consider it as
an empty slot, and will try to use it for csum tree CoW.
Then in the following call trace, we will try to lock the new tree
block, which turns out to be the old csum tree root which is already
locked:
btrfs\_search\_slot() called on csum tree root, which is at 29376512
|- btrfs\_cow\_block()
|- btrfs\_set\_lock\_block()
| |- Now locks tree block 29376512 (old csum tree root)
|- \_\_btrfs\_cow\_block()
|- btrfs\_alloc\_tree\_block()
|- btrfs\_reserve\_extent()
| Now it returns tree block 29376512, which extent tree
| shows its empty slot, but it's already hold by csum tree
|- btrfs\_init\_new\_buffer()
|- btrfs\_tree\_lock()
| Triggers WARN\_ON(eb->lock\_owner == current->pid)
|- wait\_event()
Wait lock owner to release the lock, but it's
locked by ourself, so it will deadlock
[FIX]
This patch will do the lock\_owner and current->pid check at
btrfs\_init\_new\_buffer().
So above deadlock can be avoided.
Since such problem can only happen in crafted image, we will still
trigger kernel warning for later aborted transaction, but with a little
more meaningful warning message.

[CAUSE]
Extent tree corruption. In this particular case, reloc tree root's
owner is DATA\_RELOC\_TREE (should be TREE\_RELOC), thus its backref is
corrupted and we failed the owner check in walk\_up\_tree().
[FIX]
It's pretty hard to take care of every extent tree corruption, but at
least we can remove such BUG\_ON() and exit more gracefully.
And since in this particular image, DATA\_RELOC\_TREE and TREE\_RELOC share
the same root (which is obviously invalid), we needs to make
\_\_del\_reloc\_root() more robust to detect such invalid sharing to avoid
possible NULL dereference as root->node can be NULL in this case.

btrfs: qgroup: Avoid calling qgroup functions if qgroup is not enabled
commit 3628b4ca64f24a4ec55055597d0cb1c814729f8b upstream.
Some qgroup trace events like btrfs\_qgroup\_release\_data() and
btrfs\_qgroup\_free\_delayed\_ref() can still be triggered even if qgroup is
not enabled.
This is caused by the lack of qgroup status check before calling some
qgroup functions. Thankfully the functions can handle quota disabled
case well and just do nothing for qgroup disabled case.
This patch will do earlier check before triggering related trace events.
And for enabled <-> disabled race case:
1) For enabled->disabled case
Disable will wipe out all qgroups data including reservation and
excl/rfer. Even if we leak some reservation or numbers, it will
still be cleared, so nothing will go wrong.
2) For disabled -> enabled case
Current btrfs\_qgroup\_release\_data() will use extent\_io tree to ensure
we won't underflow reservation. And for delayed\_ref we use
head->qgroup\_reserved to record the reserved space, so in that case
head->qgroup\_reserved should be 0 and we won't underflow.

selftests/powerpc: Fix ptrace tm failure
commit 48dc0ef19044bfb69193302fbe3a834e3331b7ae upstream.
Test ptrace-tm-spd-gpr fails on current kernel (4.19) due to a segmentation
fault that happens on the child process prior to setting cptr[2] = 1. This
causes the parent process to wait forever at 'while (!pptr[2])' and the test to
be killed by the test harness framework by timeout, thus, failing.
The segmentation fault happens because of a inline assembly being
generated as:
0x10000355c  lfs f0, 0(0)
This is reading memory position 0x0 and causing the segmentation fault.
This code is being generated by ASM\_LOAD\_FPR\_SINGLE\_PRECISION(flt\_4), where
flt\_4 is passed to the inline assembly block as:
[flt\_4] "r" (&d)
Since the inline assembly 'r' constraint means any GPR, gpr0 is being
chosen, thus causing this issue when issuing a Load Floating-Point Single
instruction.
This patch simply changes the constraint to 'b', which specify that this
register will be used as base, and r0 is not allowed to be used, avoiding
this issue.
Other than that, removing flt\_2 register from the input operands, since it
is not used by the inline assembly code at all.

selftests/ftrace: Fix synthetic event test to delete event correctly
commit 0d0352d8b3d6d7ca9a710b40e194cbbaeb841c88 upstream.
Fix the synthetic event test case to remove event correctly.
If redirecting command to synthetic\_event file without append
mode, it cleans up all existing events and execute (parse) the
command. This means "delete event" always fails to find the
target event.
Since previous synthetic event has a bug which doesn't return
-ENOENT even if it fails to find the deleting event, this test
passed. But fixing that bug, this test fails because this test
itself has a bug.
This fixes that bug by trying to delete event right after
adding an event, and use append mode redirection ('>>') instead
of normal redirection ('>').

drm/mediatek: fix OF sibling-node lookup
commit ceff2f4dcd44abf35864d9a99f85ac619e89a01d upstream.
Use the new of\_get\_compatible\_child() helper to lookup the sibling
instead of using of\_find\_compatible\_node(), which searches the entire
tree from a given start node and thus can return an unrelated (i.e.
non-sibling) node.
This also addresses a potential use-after-free (e.g. after probe
deferral) as the tree-wide helper drops a reference to its first
argument (i.e. the parent device node).
While at it, also fix the related cec-node reference leak.

If the wait for completion was interrupted, then make sure to cancel
any delayed work.
This can only happen if a transmit is waiting for a reply, and you press
Ctrl-C or reboot/poweroff or something like that which interrupts the
thread waiting for the reply and then proceeds to delete the CEC message.
Since the delayed work wasn't canceled, once it would trigger it referred
to stale data and resulted in a kernel oops.

commit 7d867a1b765e2b70815fec4964d7822a976ed349 upstream.
The calculation of the Signal Free Time in the framework was not
correct. If a message was received, then the next transmit should be
considered a New Initiator and use a shorter SFT value.
This was not done with the result that if both sides where continually
sending messages, they both could use the same SFT value and one side
could deny the other side access to the bus.
Note that this fix does not take the corner case into account where
a receive is in progress when you call adap\_transmit.

commit 7ec2b3b941a666a942859684281b5f6460a0c234 upstream.
If the HDMI cable is disconnected or the CEC adapter is manually
unconfigured, then all pending transmits and wait-for-replies are
aborted. Signal this with new status bits (CEC\_RX/TX\_STATUS\_ABORTED).
If due to (usually) a driver bug a transmit never ends (i.e. the
transmit\_done was never called by the driver), then when this times
out the message is marked with CEC\_TX\_STATUS\_TIMEOUT.
This should not happen and is an indication of a driver bug.
Without a separate status bit for this it was impossible to detect
this from userspace.
The 'transmit timed out' kernel message is now a warning, so this
should be more prominent in the kernel log as well.

xen: remove size limit of privcmd-buf mapping interface
commit 3941552aec1e04d63999988a057ae09a1c56ebeb upstream.
Currently the size of hypercall buffers allocated via
/dev/xen/hypercall is limited to a default of 64 memory pages. For live
migration of guests this might be too small as the page dirty bitmask
needs to be sized according to the size of the guest. This means
migrating a 8GB sized guest is already exhausting the default buffer
size for the dirty bitmap.
There is no sensible way to set a sane limit, so just remove it
completely. The device node's usage is limited to root anyway, so there

xen: fix xen\_qlock\_wait()
commit d3132b3860f6cf35ff7609a76bbcdbb814bd027c upstream.
Commit a856531951dc80 ("xen: make xen\_qlock\_wait() nestable")
introduced a regression for Xen guests running fully virtualized
(HVM or PVH mode). The Xen hypervisor wouldn't return from the poll
hypercall with interrupts disabled in case of an interrupt (for PV
guests it does).
So instead of disabling interrupts in xen\_qlock\_wait() use a nesting
counter to avoid calling xen\_clear\_irq\_pending() in case
xen\_qlock\_wait() is nested.

cec now no longer calls cec\_phys\_addr\_validate() and it can

This patch causes a bad effect on RPi. I suspect that the root

This is because the TURBOchannel bus driver fails to set the coherent
DMA mask for devices enumerated.
Set the regular and coherent DMA masks for TURBOchannel devices then,
observing that the bus protocol supports a 34-bit (16GiB) DMA address
space, by interpreting the value presented in the address cycle across
the 32 `ad' lines as a 32-bit word rather than byte address[1]. The
architectural size of the TURBOchannel DMA address space exceeds the
maximum amount of RAM any actual TURBOchannel system in existence may
have, hence both masks are the same.
This removes the warning shown above.

iommu/arm-smmu: Ensure that page-table updates are visible before TLBI
commit 7d321bd3542500caf125249f44dc37cb4e738013 upstream.
The IO-pgtable code relies on the driver TLB invalidation callbacks to
ensure that all page-table updates are visible to the IOMMU page-table
walker.
In the case that the page-table walker is cache-coherent, we cannot rely
on an implicit DSB from the DMA-mapping code, so we must ensure that we
execute a DSB in our tlb\_add\_flush() callback prior to triggering the
invalidation.

ocxl: Fix access to the AFU Descriptor Data
commit 6f8e45f7eb1bee5efdbe4a9cfe4a45627403c5fb upstream.
The AFU Information DVSEC capability is a means to extract common,
general information about all of the AFUs associated with a Function
independent of the specific functionality that each AFU provides.
Write in the AFU Index field allows to access to the descriptor data
for each AFU.
With the current code, we are not able to access to these specific data
when the index >= 1 because we are writing to the wrong location.
All requests to the data of each AFU are pointing to those of the AFU 0,
which could have impacts when using a card with more than one AFU per
function.
This patch fixes the access to the AFU Descriptor Data indexed by the
AFU Info Index field.

rtc: cmos: Fix non-ACPI undefined reference to `hpet\_rtc\_interrupt'
commit d197a253855d2d8e507a003880aab35c4e2473db upstream.
Fix a commit 311ee9c151ad ("rtc: cmos: allow using ACPI for RTC alarm
instead of HPET") `rtc-cmos' regression causing a link error:
drivers/rtc/rtc-cmos.o: In function `cmos\_platform\_probe':
rtc-cmos.c:(.init.text+0x33c): undefined reference to `hpet\_rtc\_interrupt'
rtc-cmos.c:(.init.text+0x3f4): undefined reference to `hpet\_rtc\_interrupt'
with non-ACPI platforms using this driver. The cause is the change of
the condition guarding the use of `hpet\_rtc\_interrupt'.
Previously it was a call to `is\_hpet\_enabled'. That function is static
inline and has a hardcoded 0 result for non-ACPI platforms, which imply
!HPET\_EMULATE\_RTC. Consequently the compiler optimized the whole block
away including the reference to `hpet\_rtc\_interrupt', which never made
it to the link stage.
Now the guarding condition is a call to `use\_hpet\_alarm', which is not
static inline and therefore the compiler may not be able to prove that
it actually always returns 0 for non-ACPI platforms. Consequently the
build breaks with an unsatisfied reference, because `hpet\_rtc\_interrupt'
is nowhere defined at link time.
Fix the problem by marking `use\_hpet\_alarm' inline. As the `inline'
keyword serves as an optimization hint rather than a requirement the
compiler is still free to choose whether inlining will be beneficial or
not for ACPI platforms.

powerpc/tm: Fix HFSCR bit for no suspend case
commit dd9a8c5a87395b6f05552c3b44e42fdc95760552 upstream.
Currently on P9N DD2.1 we end up taking infinite TM facility
unavailable exceptions on the first TM usage by userspace.
In the special case of TM no suspend (P9N DD2.1), Linux is told TM is
off via CPU dt-ftrs but told to (partially) use it via
OPAL\_REINIT\_CPUS\_TM\_SUSPEND\_DISABLED. So HFSCR[TM] will be off from
dt-ftrs but we need to turn it on for the no suspend case.
This patch fixes this by enabling HFSCR TM in this case.

commit 59fe7eaf3598a89cbcd72e645b1d08afd76f7b29 upstream.
module\_frob\_arch\_sections() is called before the module is moved to its
final location. The function descriptor section addresses we are setting
here are thus invalid. Fix this by processing opd section during
module\_finalize()

fsnotify: Fix busy inodes during unmount
commit 721fb6fbfd2132164c2e8777cc837f9b2c1794dc upstream.
Detaching of mark connector from fsnotify\_put\_mark() can race with
unmounting of the filesystem like:
CPU1 CPU2
fsnotify\_put\_mark()
spin\_lock(&conn->lock);
...
inode = fsnotify\_detach\_connector\_from\_object(conn)
spin\_unlock(&conn->lock);
generic\_shutdown\_super()
fsnotify\_unmount\_inodes()
sees connector detached for inode
-> nothing to do
evict\_inode()
barfs on pending inode reference
iput(inode);
Resulting in "Busy inodes after unmount" message and possible kernel
oops. Make fsnotify\_unmount\_inodes() properly wait for outstanding inode
references from detached connectors.
Note that the accounting of outstanding inode references in the
superblock can cause some cacheline contention on the counter. OTOH it
happens only during deletion of the last notification mark from an inode
(or during unlinking of watched inode) and that is not too bad. I have
measured time to create & delete inotify watch 100000 times from 64
processes in parallel (each process having its own inotify group and its
own file on a shared superblock) on a 64 CPU machine. Average and
standard deviation of 15 runs look like:
Avg Stddev
Vanilla 9.817400 0.276165
Fixed 9.710467 0.228294
So there's no statistically significant difference.

dm zoned: fix various dmz\_get\_mblock() issues
commit 3d4e738311327bc4ba1d55fbe2f1da3de4a475f9 upstream.
dmz\_fetch\_mblock() called from dmz\_get\_mblock() has a race since the
allocation of the new metadata block descriptor and its insertion in
the cache rbtree with the READING state is not atomic. Two different
contexts requesting the same block may end up each adding two different
descriptors of the same block to the cache.
Another problem for this function is that the BIO for processing the
block read is allocated after the metadata block descriptor is inserted
in the cache rbtree. If the BIO allocation fails, the metadata block
descriptor is freed without first being removed from the rbtree.
Fix the first problem by checking again if the requested block is not in
the cache right before inserting the newly allocated descriptor,
atomically under the mblk\_lock spinlock. The second problem is fixed by
simply allocating the BIO before inserting the new block in the cache.
Finally, since dmz\_fetch\_mblock() also increments a block reference
counter, rename the function to dmz\_get\_mblock\_slow(). To be symmetric
and clear, also rename dmz\_lookup\_mblock() to dmz\_get\_mblock\_fast() and
increment the block reference counter directly in that function rather
than in dmz\_get\_mblock().

dm ioctl: harden copy\_params()'s copy\_from\_user() from malicious users
commit 800a7340ab7dd667edf95e74d8e4f23a17e87076 upstream.
In copy\_params(), the struct 'dm\_ioctl' is first copied from the user
space buffer 'user' to 'param\_kernel' and the field 'data\_size' is
checked against 'minimum\_data\_size' (size of 'struct dm\_ioctl' payload
up to its 'data' member). If the check fails, an error code EINVAL will be
returned. Otherwise, param\_kernel->data\_size is used to do a second copy,
which copies from the same user-space buffer to 'dmi'. After the second
copy, only 'dmi->data\_size' is checked against 'param\_kernel->data\_size'.
Given that the buffer 'user' resides in the user space, a malicious
user-space process can race to change the content in the buffer between
the two copies. This way, the attacker can inject inconsistent data
into 'dmi' (versus previously validated 'param\_kernel').
Fix redundant copying of 'minimum\_data\_size' from user-space buffer by
using the first copy stored in 'param\_kernel'. Also remove the
'data\_size' check after the second copy because it is now unnecessary.

NFSv4.1: Fix the r/wsize checking
commit 943cff67b842839f4f35364ba2db5c2d3f025d94 upstream.
The intention of nfs4\_session\_set\_rwsize() was to cap the r/wsize to the
buffer sizes negotiated by the CREATE\_SESSION. The initial code had a
bug whereby we would not check the values negotiated by nfs\_probe\_fsinfo()
(the assumption being that CREATE\_SESSION will always negotiate buffer values
that are sane w.r.t. the server's preferred r/wsizes) but would only check
values set by the user in the 'mount' command.
The code was changed in 4.11 to \_always\_ set the r/wsize, meaning that we
now never use the server preferred r/wsizes. This is the regression that
this patch fixes.
Also rename the function to nfs4\_session\_limit\_rwsize() in order to avoid
future confusion.

Use the new of\_get\_compatible\_child() helper to lookup the nfc child

entire tree from a given start node and thus can return an unrelated

This also addresses a potential use-after-free (e.g. after probe

genirq: Fix race on spurious interrupt detection
commit 746a923b863a1065ef77324e1e43f19b1a3eab5c upstream.
Commit 1e77d0a1ed74 ("genirq: Sanitize spurious interrupt detection of
threaded irqs") made detection of spurious interrupts work for threaded
handlers by:
a) incrementing a counter every time the thread returns IRQ\_HANDLED, and
b) checking whether that counter has increased every time the thread is
woken.
However for oneshot interrupts, the commit unmasks the interrupt before
incrementing the counter. If another interrupt occurs right after
unmasking but before the counter is incremented, that interrupt is
incorrectly considered spurious:
time
| irq\_thread()
| irq\_thread\_fn()
| action->thread\_fn()
| irq\_finalize\_oneshot()
| unmask\_threaded\_irq() /\* interrupt is unmasked \*/
|
| /\* interrupt fires, incorrectly deemed spurious \*/
|
| atomic\_inc(&desc->threads\_handled); /\* counter is incremented \*/
v
This is observed with a hi3110 CAN controller receiving data at high volume
(from a separate machine sending with "cangen -g 0 -i -x"): The controller
signals a huge number of interrupts (hundreds of millions per day) and
every second there are about a dozen which are deemed spurious.
In theory with high CPU load and the presence of higher priority tasks, the
number of incorrectly detected spurious interrupts might increase beyond
the 99,900 threshold and cause disablement of the interrupt.
In practice it just increments the spurious interrupt count. But that can
cause people to waste time investigating it over and over.
Fix it by moving the accounting before the invocation of
irq\_finalize\_oneshot().

smb3: on kerberos mount if server doesn't specify auth type use krb5
commit 926674de6705f0f1dbf29a62fd758d0977f535d6 upstream.
Some servers (e.g. Azure) do not include a spnego blob in the SMB3
negotiate protocol response, so on kerberos mounts ("sec=krb5")
we can fail, as we expected the server to list its supported
auth types (OIDs in the spnego blob in the negprot response).
Change this so that on krb5 mounts we default to trying krb5 if the
server doesn't list its supported protocol mechanisms.

iio: adc: at91: fix wrong channel number in triggered buffer mode
commit aea835f2dc8a682942b859179c49ad1841a6c8b9 upstream.
When channels are registered, the hardware channel number is not the
actual iio channel number.
This is because the driver is probed with a certain number of accessible
channels. Some pins are routed and some not, depending on the description of
the board in the DT.
Because of that, channels 0,1,2,3 can correspond to hardware channels
2,3,4,5 for example.
In the buffered triggered case, we need to do the translation accordingly.
Fixed the channel number to stop reading the wrong channel.

iio: adc: at91: fix acking DRDY irq on simple conversions
commit bc1b45326223e7e890053cf6266357adfa61942d upstream.
When doing simple conversions, the driver did not acknowledge the DRDY irq.
If this irq status is not acked, it will be left pending, and as soon as a
trigger is enabled, the irq handler will be called, it doesn't know why
this status has occurred because no channel is pending, and then it will go
int a irq loop and board will hang.
To avoid this situation, read the LCDR after a raw conversion is done.

iio: ad5064: Fix regulator handling
commit 8911a43bc198877fad9f4b0246a866b26bb547ab upstream.
The correct way to handle errors returned by regualtor\_get() and friends is
to propagate the error since that means that an regulator was specified,
but something went wrong when requesting it.
For handling optional regulators, e.g. when the device has an internal
vref, regulator\_get\_optional() should be used to avoid getting the dummy
regulator that the regulator core otherwise provides.

kbuild: fix kernel/bounds.c 'W=1' warning
commit 6a32c2469c3fbfee8f25bcd20af647326650a6cf upstream.
Building any configuration with 'make W=1' produces a warning:
kernel/bounds.c:16:6: warning: no previous prototype for 'foo' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
When also passing -Werror, this prevents us from building any other files.
Nobody ever calls the function, but we can't make it 'static' either
since we want the compiler output.
Calling it 'main' instead however avoids the warning, because gcc
does not insist on having a declaration for main.

KVM: arm64: Fix caching of host MDCR\_EL2 value
commit da5a3ce66b8bb51b0ea8a89f42aac153903f90fb upstream.
At boot time, KVM stashes the host MDCR\_EL2 value, but only does this
when the kernel is not running in hyp mode (i.e. is non-VHE). In these
cases, the stashed value of MDCR\_EL2.HPMN happens to be zero, which can
lead to CONSTRAINED UNPREDICTABLE behaviour.
Since we use this value to derive the MDCR\_EL2 value when switching
to/from a guest, after a guest have been run, the performance counters
do not behave as expected. This has been observed to result in accesses
via PMXEVTYPER\_EL0 and PMXEVCNTR\_EL0 not affecting the relevant
counters, resulting in events not being counted. In these cases, only
the fixed-purpose cycle counter appears to work as expected.
Fix this by always stashing the host MDCR\_EL2 value, regardless of VHE.

KVM: arm/arm64: Ensure only THP is candidate for adjustment
commit fd2ef358282c849c193aa36dadbf4f07f7dcd29b upstream.
PageTransCompoundMap() returns true for hugetlbfs and THP
hugepages. This behaviour incorrectly leads to stage 2 faults for
unsupported hugepage sizes (e.g., 64K hugepage with 4K pages) to be
treated as THP faults.
Tighten the check to filter out hugetlbfs pages. This also leads to
consistently mapping all unsupported hugepage sizes as PTE level
entries at stage 2.

mm/hmm: fix race between hmm\_mirror\_unregister() and mmu\_notifier callback
commit 86a2d59841ab0b147ffc1b7b3041af87927cf312 upstream.
In hmm\_mirror\_unregister(), mm->hmm is set to NULL and then
mmu\_notifier\_unregister\_no\_release() is called. That creates a small
window where mmu\_notifier can call mmu\_notifier\_ops with mm->hmm equal to
NULL. Fix this by first unregistering mmu notifier callbacks and then
setting mm->hmm to NULL.
Similarly in hmm\_register(), set mm->hmm before registering mmu\_notifier
callbacks so callback functions always see mm->hmm set.

mm/rmap: map\_pte() was not handling private ZONE\_DEVICE page properly
commit aab8d0520e6e7c2a61f71195e6ce7007a4843afb upstream.
Private ZONE\_DEVICE pages use a special pte entry and thus are not
present. Properly handle this case in map\_pte(), it is already handled in
check\_pte(), the map\_pte() part was lost in some rebase most probably.
Without this patch the slow migration path can not migrate back to any
private ZONE\_DEVICE memory to regular memory. This was found after stress
testing migration back to system memory. This ultimatly can lead to the
CPU constantly page fault looping on the special swap entry.

hugetlbfs: dirty pages as they are added to pagecache
commit 22146c3ce98962436e401f7b7016a6f664c9ffb5 upstream.
Some test systems were experiencing negative huge page reserve counts and
incorrect file block counts. This was traced to /proc/sys/vm/drop\_caches
removing clean pages from hugetlbfs file pagecaches. When non-hugetlbfs
explicit code removes the pages, the appropriate accounting is not
performed.
This can be recreated as follows:
fallocate -l 2M /dev/hugepages/foo
echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop\_caches
fallocate -l 2M /dev/hugepages/foo
grep -i huge /proc/meminfo
AnonHugePages: 0 kB
ShmemHugePages: 0 kB
HugePages\_Total: 2048
HugePages\_Free: 2047
HugePages\_Rsvd: 18446744073709551615
HugePages\_Surp: 0
Hugepagesize: 2048 kB
Hugetlb: 4194304 kB
ls -lsh /dev/hugepages/foo
4.0M -rw-r--r--. 1 root root 2.0M Oct 17 20:05 /dev/hugepages/foo
To address this issue, dirty pages as they are added to pagecache. This
can easily be reproduced with fallocate as shown above. Read faulted
pages will eventually end up being marked dirty. But there is a window
where they are clean and could be impacted by code such as drop\_caches.
So, just dirty them all as they are added to the pagecache.

userfaultfd contains howe-grown locking of the waitqueue lock, and does
not disable interrupts. This relies on the fact that no one else takes it
from interrupt context and violates an invariat of the normal waitqueue
locking scheme. With aio poll it is easy to trigger other locks that
disable interrupts (or are called from interrupt context).

false.
To fix, reset the check\_shmem\_swap flag to false. There's also related

smaps\_rollup overwrites any value accumulated from previous vma's. Fix
that as well.

But the mss was reused for rollup since 493b0e9d945f ("mm: add

crypto: aesni - don't use GFP\_ATOMIC allocation if the request doesn't cross a page in gcm
commit a788848116454d753b13a4888e0e31ada3c4d393 upstream.
This patch fixes gcmaes\_crypt\_by\_sg so that it won't use memory
allocation if the data doesn't cross a page boundary.
Authenticated encryption may be used by dm-crypt. If the encryption or
decryption fails, it would result in I/O error and filesystem corruption.
The function gcmaes\_crypt\_by\_sg is using GFP\_ATOMIC allocation that can
fail anytime. This patch fixes the logic so that it won't attempt the
failing allocation if the data doesn't cross a page boundary.

signal: Guard against negative signal numbers in copy\_siginfo\_from\_user32

While fixing an out of bounds array access in known\_siginfo\_layout
reported by the kernel test robot it became apparent that the same bug
exists in siginfo\_layout and affects copy\_siginfo\_from\_user32.
The straight forward fix that makes guards against making this mistake
in the future and should keep the code size small is to just take an
unsigned signal number instead of a signed signal number, as I did to
fix known\_siginfo\_layout.

signal/GenWQE: Fix sending of SIGKILL
commit 0ab93e9c99f8208c0a1a7b7170c827936268c996 upstream.
The genweq\_add\_file and genwqe\_del\_file by caching current without
using reference counting embed the assumption that a file descriptor
will never be passed from one process to another. It even embeds the
assumption that the the thread that opened the file will be in
existence when the process terminates. Neither of which are
guaranteed to be true.
Therefore replace caching the task\_struct of the opener with
pid of the openers thread group id. All the knowledge of the
opener is used for is as the target of SIGKILL and a SIGKILL
will kill the entire process group.
Rename genwqe\_force\_sig to genwqe\_terminate, remove it's unncessary
signal argument, update it's ownly caller, and use kill\_pid
instead of force\_sig.
The work force\_sig does in changing signal handling state is not
relevant to SIGKILL sent as SEND\_SIG\_PRIV. The exact same processess
will be killed just with less work, and less confusion. The work done
by force\_sig is really only needed for handling syncrhonous
exceptions.
It will still be possible to cause genwqe\_device\_remove to wait
8 seconds by passing a file descriptor to another process but
the possible user after free is fixed.

PCI: Add Device IDs for Intel GPU "spurious interrupt" quirk
commit d0c9606b31a21028fb5b753c8ad79626292accfd upstream.
Add Device IDs to the Intel GPU "spurious interrupt" quirk table.
For these devices, unplugging the VGA cable and plugging it in again causes
spurious interrupts from the IGD. Linux eventually disables the interrupt,
but of course that disables any other devices sharing the interrupt.
The theory is that this is a VGA BIOS defect: it should have disabled the
IGD interrupt but failed to do so.
See f67fd55fa96f ("PCI: Add quirk for still enabled interrupts on Intel
Sandy Bridge GPUs") and 7c82126a94e6 ("PCI: Add new ID for Intel GPU
"spurious interrupt" quirk") for some history.
[bhelgaas: See link below for discussion about how to fix this more
generically instead of adding device IDs for every new Intel GPU. I hope
this is the last patch to add device IDs.]

PCI/ASPM: Fix link\_state teardown on device removal
commit aeae4f3e5c38d47bdaef50446dc0ec857307df68 upstream.
Upon removal of the last device on a bus, the link\_state of the bridge
leading to that bus is sought to be torn down by having pci\_stop\_dev()
call pcie\_aspm\_exit\_link\_state().
When ASPM was originally introduced by commit 7d715a6c1ae5 ("PCI: add
PCI Express ASPM support"), it determined whether the device being
removed is the last one by calling list\_empty() on the bridge's
subordinate devices list. That didn't work because the device is only
removed from the list slightly later in pci\_destroy\_dev().
Commit 3419c75e15f8 ("PCI: properly clean up ASPM link state on device
remove") attempted to fix it by calling list\_is\_last(), but that's not
correct either because it checks whether the device is at the \*end\* of
the list, not whether it's the last one \*left\* in the list. If the user
removes the device which happens to be at the end of the list via sysfs
but other devices are preceding the device in the list, the link\_state
is torn down prematurely.
The real fix is to move the invocation of pcie\_aspm\_exit\_link\_state() to
pci\_destroy\_dev() and reinstate the call to list\_empty(). Remove a
duplicate check for dev->bus->self because pcie\_aspm\_exit\_link\_state()
already contains an identical check.

HID: hiddev: fix potential Spectre v1
commit f11274396a538b31bc010f782e05c2ce3f804c13 upstream.
uref->usage\_index can be indirectly controlled by userspace, hence leading
to a potential exploitation of the Spectre variant 1 vulnerability.
This field is used as an array index by the hiddev\_ioctl\_usage() function,
when 'cmd' is either HIDIOCGCOLLECTIONINDEX, HIDIOCGUSAGES or
HIDIOCSUSAGES.
For cmd == HIDIOCGCOLLECTIONINDEX case, uref->usage\_index is compared to
field->maxusage and then used as an index to dereference field->usage
array. The same thing happens to the cmd == HIDIOC{G,S}USAGES cases, where
uref->usage\_index is checked against an array maximum value and then it is
used as an index in an array.
This is a summary of the HIDIOCGCOLLECTIONINDEX case, which matches the
traditional Spectre V1 first load:
copy\_from\_user(uref, user\_arg, sizeof(\*uref))
if (uref->usage\_index >= field->maxusage)
goto inval;
i = field->usage[uref->usage\_index].collection\_index;
return i;
This patch fixes this by sanitizing field uref->usage\_index before using it
to index field->usage (HIDIOCGCOLLECTIONINDEX) or field->value in
HIDIOC{G,S}USAGES arrays, thus, avoiding speculation in the first load.

HID: wacom: Work around HID descriptor bug in DTK-2451 and DTH-2452
commit 11db8173dbab7a94cf5ba5225fcedbfc0f3b7e54 upstream.
The DTK-2451 and DTH-2452 have a buggy HID descriptor which incorrectly
contains a Cintiq-like report, complete with pen tilt, rotation, twist, serial
number, etc. The hardware doesn't actually support this data but our driver
duitifully sets up the device as though it does. To ensure userspace has a
correct view of devices without updated firmware, we clean up this incorrect
data in wacom\_setup\_device\_quirks.
We're also careful to clear the WACOM\_QUIRK\_TOOLSERIAL flag since its presence
causes the driver to wait for serial number information (via
wacom\_wac\_pen\_serial\_enforce) that never comes, resulting in
the pen being non-responsive.

selinux: fix mounting of cgroup2 under older policies
commit 7bb185edb0306bb90029a5fa6b9cff900ffdbf4b upstream.
commit 901ef845fa2469c ("selinux: allow per-file labeling for cgroupfs")
broke mounting of cgroup2 under older SELinux policies which lacked
a genfscon rule for cgroup2. This prevents mounting of cgroup2 even
when SELinux is permissive.
Change the handling when there is no genfscon rule in policy to
just mark the inode unlabeled and not return an error to the caller.
This permits mounting and access if allowed by policy, e.g. to
unconfined domains.
I also considered changing the behavior of security\_genfs\_sid() to
never return -ENOENT, but the current behavior is relied upon by
other callers to perform caller-specific handling.

ext4: fix setattr project check in fssetxattr ioctl
commit dc7ac6c4cae3b58724c2f1e21a7c05ce19ecd5a8 upstream.
Currently, project quota could be changed by fssetxattr
ioctl, and existed permission check inode\_owner\_or\_capable()
is obviously not enough, just think that common users could
change project id of file, that could make users to
break project quota easily.
This patch try to follow same regular of xfs project
quota:
"Project Quota ID state is only allowed to change from
within the init namespace. Enforce that restriction only
if we are trying to change the quota ID state.
Everything else is allowed in user namespaces."
Besides that, check and set project id'state should
be an atomic operation, protect whole operation with
inode lock, ext4\_ioctl\_setproject() is only used for
ioctl EXT4\_IOC\_FSSETXATTR, we have held mnt\_want\_write\_file()
before ext4\_ioctl\_setflags(), and ext4\_ioctl\_setproject()
is called after ext4\_ioctl\_setflags(), we could share
codes, so remove it inside ext4\_ioctl\_setproject().

ib\_uverbs\_post\_send() command expect userspace to supply values from this
enum. So it should be properly placed in include/uapi/rdma.
In userspace this enum is called 'enum ibv\_wr\_opcode' as part of
libibverbs.h. That enum defines different values for IB\_WR\_LOCAL\_INV,
IB\_WR\_SEND\_WITH\_INV, and IB\_WR\_LSO. These were introduced (incorrectly, it
turns out) into libiberbs in 2015.
The kernel has changed its mind on the numbering for several of the IB\_WC
values over the years, but has remained stable on IB\_WR\_LOCAL\_INV and
below.
Based on this we can conclude that there is no real user space user of the
values beyond IB\_WR\_ATOMIC\_FETCH\_AND\_ADD, as they have never worked via
rdma-core. This is confirmed by inspection, only rxe uses the kernel enum
and implements the latter operations. rxe has clearly never worked with
these attributes from userspace. Other drivers that support these opcodes
implement the functionality without calling out to the kernel.
To make IB\_WR\_SEND\_WITH\_INV and related work for RXE in userspace we
choose to renumber the IB\_WR enum in the kernel to match the uABI that
userspace has bee using since before Soft RoCE was merged. This is an
overall simpler configuration for the whole software stack, and obviously
can't break anything existing.

scsi: target: Fix target\_wait\_for\_sess\_cmds breakage with active signals
commit 38fe73cc2c96fbc9942b07220f2a4f1bab37392d upstream.
With the addition of commit 00d909a10710 ("scsi: target: Make the session
shutdown code also wait for commands that are being aborted") in v4.19-rc, it
incorrectly assumes no signals will be pending for task\_struct executing the
normal session shutdown and I/O quiesce code-path.
For example, iscsi-target and iser-target issue SIGINT to all kthreads as part
of session shutdown. This has been the behaviour since day one.
As-is when signals are pending with se\_cmds active in se\_sess->sess\_cmd\_list,
wait\_event\_interruptible\_lock\_irq\_timeout() returns a negative number and
immediately kills the machine because of the do while (ret <= 0) loop that was
added in commit 00d909a107 to spin while backend I/O is taking any amount of
extended time (say 30 seconds) to complete.
Here's what it looks like in action with debug plus delayed backend I/O
completion:
[ 4951.909951] se\_sess: 000000003e7e08fa before target\_wait\_for\_sess\_cmds

[ 4951.921944] wait\_event\_interruptible\_lock\_irq\_timeout ret: -512 signal\_pending: 1 loop count: 9
... followed by the usual RCU CPU stalls and deadlock.
There was never a case pre commit 00d909a107 where
wait\_for\_complete(&se\_cmd->cmd\_wait\_comp) was able to be interrupted, so to
address this for v4.19+ moving forward go ahead and use
wait\_event\_lock\_irq\_timeout() instead so new code works with all fabric
drivers.
Also for commit 00d909a107, fix a minor regression in
target\_release\_cmd\_kref() to only wake\_up the new se\_sess->cmd\_list\_wq only
when shutdown has actually been triggered via se\_sess->sess\_tearing\_down.

scsi: sched/wait: Add wait\_event\_lock\_irq\_timeout for TASK\_UNINTERRUPTIBLE usage
commit 25ab0bc334b43bbbe4eabc255006ce42a9424da2 upstream.
Short of reverting commit 00d909a10710 ("scsi: target: Make the session
shutdown code also wait for commands that are being aborted") for v4.19,
target-core needs a wait\_event\_t macro can be executed using
TASK\_UNINTERRUPTIBLE to function correctly with existing fabric drivers that
expect to run with signals pending during session shutdown and active se\_cmd
I/O quiesce.
The most notable is iscsi-target/iser-target, while ibmvscsi\_tgt invokes
session shutdown logic from userspace via configfs attribute that could also
potentially have signals pending.
So go ahead and introduce wait\_event\_lock\_irq\_timeout() to achieve this, and
update + rename \_\_wait\_event\_lock\_irq\_timeout() to make it accept 'state' as a
parameter.

net/ipv4: defensive cipso option parsing
commit 076ed3da0c9b2f88d9157dbe7044a45641ae369e upstream.
commit 40413955ee26 ("Cipso: cipso\_v4\_optptr enter infinite loop") fixed
a possible infinite loop in the IP option parsing of CIPSO. The fix
assumes that ip\_options\_compile filtered out all zero length options and
that no other one-byte options beside IPOPT\_END and IPOPT\_NOOP exist.
While this assumption currently holds true, add explicit checks for zero
length and invalid length options to be safe for the future. Even though
ip\_options\_compile should have validated the options, the introduction of
new one-byte options can still confuse this code without the additional
checks.

xen: make xen\_qlock\_wait() nestable
commit a856531951dc8094359dfdac21d59cee5969c18e upstream.
xen\_qlock\_wait() isn't safe for nested calls due to interrupts. A call
of xen\_qlock\_kick() might be ignored in case a deeper nesting level
was active right before the call of xen\_poll\_irq():
CPU 1: CPU 2:
spin\_lock(lock1)
spin\_lock(lock1)
-> xen\_qlock\_wait()
-> xen\_clear\_irq\_pending()
Interrupt happens
spin\_unlock(lock1)
-> xen\_qlock\_kick(CPU 2)
spin\_lock\_irqsave(lock2)
spin\_lock\_irqsave(lock2)
-> xen\_qlock\_wait()
-> xen\_clear\_irq\_pending()
clears kick for lock1
-> xen\_poll\_irq()
spin\_unlock\_irq\_restore(lock2)
-> xen\_qlock\_kick(CPU 2)
wakes up
spin\_unlock\_irq\_restore(lock2)
IRET
resumes in xen\_qlock\_wait()
-> xen\_poll\_irq()
never wakes up
The solution is to disable interrupts in xen\_qlock\_wait() and not to
poll for the irq in case xen\_qlock\_wait() is called in nmi context.

xen: fix race in xen\_qlock\_wait()
commit 2ac2a7d4d9ff4e01e36f9c3d116582f6f655ab47 upstream.
In the following situation a vcpu waiting for a lock might not be
woken up from xen\_poll\_irq():
CPU 1: CPU 2: CPU 3:
takes a spinlock
tries to get lock
-> xen\_qlock\_wait()
frees the lock
-> xen\_qlock\_kick(cpu2)
-> xen\_clear\_irq\_pending()
takes lock again
tries to get lock
-> \*lock = \_Q\_SLOW\_VAL
-> \*lock == \_Q\_SLOW\_VAL ?
-> xen\_poll\_irq()
frees the lock
-> xen\_qlock\_kick(cpu3)
And cpu 2 will sleep forever.
This can be avoided easily by modifying xen\_qlock\_wait() to call
xen\_poll\_irq() only if the related irq was not pending and to call
xen\_clear\_irq\_pending() only if it was pending.

xen/blkfront: avoid NULL blkfront\_info dereference on device removal
commit f92898e7f32e3533bfd95be174044bc349d416ca upstream.
If a block device is hot-added when we are out of grants,
gnttab\_grant\_foreign\_access fails with -ENOSPC (log message "28
granting access to ring page") in this code path:
talk\_to\_blkback ->
setup\_blkring ->
xenbus\_grant\_ring ->
gnttab\_grant\_foreign\_access
and the failing path in talk\_to\_blkback sets the driver\_data to NULL:
destroy\_blkring:
blkif\_free(info, 0);
mutex\_lock(&blkfront\_mutex);
free\_info(info);
mutex\_unlock(&blkfront\_mutex);
dev\_set\_drvdata(&dev->dev, NULL);
This results in a NULL pointer BUG when blkfront\_remove and blkif\_free
try to access the failing device's NULL struct blkfront\_info.

tpm: Restore functionality to xen vtpm driver.
commit e487a0f52301293152a6f8c4e217f2a11dd808e3 upstream.
Functionality of the xen-tpmfront driver was lost secondary to
the introduction of xenbus multi-page support in commit ccc9d90a9a8b
("xenbus\_client: Extend interface to support multi-page ring").
In this commit pointer to location of where the shared page address
is stored was being passed to the xenbus\_grant\_ring() function rather
then the address of the shared page itself. This resulted in a situation
where the driver would attach to the vtpm-stubdom but any attempt
to send a command to the stub domain would timeout.
A diagnostic finding for this regression is the following error
message being generated when the xen-tpmfront driver probes for a
device:
<3>vtpm vtpm-0: tpm\_transmit: tpm\_send: error -62
<3>vtpm vtpm-0: A TPM error (-62) occurred attempting to determine
the timeouts
This fix is relevant to all kernels from 4.1 forward which is the
release in which multi-page xenbus support was introduced.
Daniel De Graaf formulated the fix by code inspection after the
regression point was located.

xen-swiotlb: use actually allocated size on check physical continuous
commit 7250f422da0480d8512b756640f131b9b893ccda upstream.
xen\_swiotlb\_{alloc,free}\_coherent() allocate/free memory based on the
order of the pages and not size argument (bytes). This is inconsistent with
range\_straddles\_page\_boundary and memset which use the 'size' value,
which may lead to not exchanging memory with Xen (range\_straddles\_page\_boundary()
returned true). And then the call to xen\_swiotlb\_free\_coherent() would
actually try to exchange the memory with Xen, leading to the kernel
hitting an BUG (as the hypercall returned an error).
This patch fixes it by making the 'size' variable be of the same size
as the amount of memory allocated.

f2fs: fix to recover cold bit of inode block during POR
commit ef2a007134b4eaa39264c885999f296577bc87d2 upstream.
Testcase to reproduce this bug:
1. mkfs.f2fs /dev/sdd
2. mount -t f2fs /dev/sdd /mnt/f2fs
3. touch /mnt/f2fs/file
4. sync
5. chattr +A /mnt/f2fs/file
6. xfs\_io -f /mnt/f2fs/file -c "fsync"
7. godown /mnt/f2fs
8. umount /mnt/f2fs
9. mount -t f2fs /dev/sdd /mnt/f2fs
10. chattr -A /mnt/f2fs/file
11. xfs\_io -f /mnt/f2fs/file -c "fsync"
12. umount /mnt/f2fs
13. mount -t f2fs /dev/sdd /mnt/f2fs
14. lsattr /mnt/f2fs/file
-----------------N- /mnt/f2fs/file
But actually, we expect the corrct result is:
-------A---------N- /mnt/f2fs/file
The reason is in step 9) we missed to recover cold bit flag in inode
block, so later, in fsync, we will skip write inode block due to below
condition check, result in lossing data in another SPOR.
f2fs\_fsync\_node\_pages()
if (!IS\_DNODE(page) || !is\_cold\_node(page))
continue;
Note that, I guess that some non-dir inode has already lost cold bit
during POR, so in order to reenable recovery for those inode, let's
try to recover cold bit in f2fs\_iget() to save more fsynced data.

IB/rxe: fix for duplicate request processing and ack psns
[ Upstream commit b97db58557f4aa6d9903f8e1deea6b3d1ed0ba43 ]
Don't reset the resp opcode for a replayed read response.
The resp opcode could be in the middle of a write or send
sequence, when the duplicate read request was received.
An example sequence is as follows:
- Receive read request for 12KB PSN 20. Transmit read response
first, middle and last with PSNs 20,21,22.
- Receive write first PSN 23.
At this point the resp psn is 24 and resp opcode is write first.
- The sender notices that PSN 20 is dropped and retransmits.
Receive read request for 12KB PSN 20. Transmit read response
first, middle and last with PSNs 20,21,22. The resp opcode is
set to -1, the resp psn remains 24.
- Receive write first PSN 23. This is processed by duplicate\_request().
The resp opcode remains -1 and resp psn remains 24.
- Receive write middle PSN 24. check\_op\_seq() reports a missing
first error since the resp opcode is -1.
When sending an ack for a duplicate send or write request,
use the psn of the previous ack sent. Do not use the psn
of a read response for the ack.
An example sequence is as follows:
- Receive write PSN 30. Transmit ACK for PSN 30.
- Receive read request 4KB PSN 31. Transmit read response with
PSN 31. The resp psn is now 32.
- The sender notices that PSN 30 is dropped and retransmits.
Receive write PSN 30. duplicate\_request() sends an ACK with
PSN 31. That is incorrect since PSN 31 was a read request.

6. kill process[pid = x]
7. umount /mnt/f2fs
8. mount -t f2fs -o ro /dev/zram0 /mnt/f2fs
9. umount /mnt/f2fs
The reason is: during recovery, i\_{c,m}time of inode will be updated, then
the inode can be set dirty w/o being tracked in sbi->inode\_list[DIRTY\_META]
global list, so later write\_checkpoint will not flush such dirty inode into
node page.
Once umount is called, sync\_filesystem() in generic\_shutdown\_super() will
skip syncng dirty inodes due to sb\_rdonly check, leaving dirty inodes
there.
To solve this issue, during umount, add remove SB\_RDONLY flag in
sb->s\_flags, to make sure sync\_filesystem() will not be skipped.

f2fs: report error if quota off error during umount
[ Upstream commit cda9cc595f0bb6ffa51a4efc4b6533dfa4039b4c ]
Now, we depend on fsck to ensure quota file data is ok,
so we scan whole partition if checkpoint without umount
flag. It's same for quota off error case, which may make
quota file data inconsistent.
generic/019 reports below error:

scsi: lpfc: Correct race with abort on completion path
[ Upstream commit ca7fb76e091f889cfda1287c07a9358f73832b39 ]
On io completion, the driver is taking an adapter wide lock and nulling the
scsi command back pointer. The nulling of the back pointer is to signify the
io was completed and the scsi\_done() routine was called. However, the routine
makes no check to see if the abort routine had done the same thing and
possibly nulled the pointer. Thus it may doubly-complete the io.
Make the following mods:
- Check to make sure forward progress (call scsi\_done()) only happens if the
command pointer was non-null.
- As the taking of the lock, which is adapter wide, is very costly on a system
under load, null the pointer using an xchg operation rather than under lock.

When running an mds diagnostic that passes frames with the switch, soft
lockups are detected. The driver is in a CQE processing loop and has
sufficient amount of traffic that it never exits the ring processing routine,
thus the "lockup".
Cap the number of elements in the work processing routine to 64 elements. This
ensures that the cpu will be given up and the handler reschedule to process
additional items.

uio: ensure class is registered before devices
[ Upstream commit ae61cf5b9913027c6953a79ed3894da4f47061bd ]
When both uio and the uio drivers are built in the kernel, it is possible
for a driver to register devices before the uio class is registered.
This may result in a NULL pointer dereference later on in
get\_device\_parent() when accessing the class glue\_dirs spinlock.

IB/ipoib: Use dev\_port to expose network interface port numbers
[ Upstream commit 9b8b2a323008aedd39a8debb861b825707f01420 ]
Some InfiniBand network devices have multiple ports on the same PCI
function. This initializes the `dev\_port' sysfs field of those
network interfaces with their port number.
Prior to this the kernel erroneously used the `dev\_id' sysfs
field of those network interfaces to convey the port number to userspace.
The use of `dev\_id' was considered correct until Linux 3.15,
when another field, `dev\_port', was defined for this particular
purpose and `dev\_id' was reserved for distinguishing stacked ifaces
(e.g: VLANs) with the same hardware address as their parent device.
Similar fixes to net/mlx4\_en and many other drivers, which started
exporting this information through `dev\_id' before 3.15, were accepted
into the kernel 4 years ago.
See 76a066f2a2a0 (`net/mlx4\_en: Expose port number through sysfs').

Both callers of coreboot\_table\_init() ioremap the pointer that comes in
but they don't unmap the memory on failure. Both of them also fail probe
immediately with the return value of coreboot\_table\_init(), leaking a
mapping when it fails. The mapping isn't necessary at all after devices
are populated either, so we can just drop the mapping here when we exit
the function. Let's do that to simplify the code a bit and plug the leak.

spin\_unlock\_bh(&ioat\_chan->prep\_lock);
According to the synchronization rule for the del\_timer\_sync() function,
the caller must not hold locks which would prevent completion of the
timer's handler.
The timer structure has its own lock that manages its synchronization.
Setting the IOAT\_CHAN\_DOWN bit should prevent other CPUs from
trying to use that device anyway, there is probably no need to call
del\_timer\_sync() while holding the prep\_lock. So the del\_timer\_sync()
call is now moved outside of the prep\_lock critical section to prevent
the circular lock dependency.

xhci: Avoid USB autosuspend when resuming USB2 ports.
[ Upstream commit 330e2d61cdd58363eb5e66b2e72f76fe3c5492e0 ]
When USB bus host controller root hub resumes from autosuspend,
it immediately tries to enter auto-suspend, but there can be a
scenario when root hub is resuming its usb2 ports, in that particular
case USB host controller auto suspend fails since it is busy
to resuming its usb2 ports.
This makes multiple failed cycles of auto-suspend until all usb2
ports of host controller root hub do not resume.
This patch uses USB core framework usb\_hcd\_start\_port\_resume,
usb\_hcd\_end\_port\_resume API's in order to autoresume/autosuspend
root hub properly.

xprtrdma: Reset credit grant properly after a disconnect

On a fresh connection, an RPC/RDMA client is supposed to send only
one RPC Call until it gets a credit grant in the first RPC Reply
from the server [RFC 8166, Section 3.3.3].
There is a bug in the Linux client's credit accounting mechanism
introduced by commit e7ce710a8802 ("xprtrdma: Avoid deadlock when
credit window is reset"). On connect, it simply dumps all pending
RPC Calls onto the new connection.
Servers have been tolerant of this bad behavior. Currently no server
implementation ever changes its credit grant over reconnects, and
servers always repost enough Receives before connections are fully
established.
To correct this issue, ensure that the client resets both the credit
grant \_and\_ the congestion window when handling a reconnect.

PCI / ACPI: Enable wake automatically for power managed bridges
[ Upstream commit 6299cf9ec3985cac70bede8a855b5087b81a6640 ]
We enable power management automatically for bridges where
pci\_bridge\_d3\_possible() returns true. However, these bridges may have
ACPI methods such as \_DSW that need to be called before D3 entry. For
example in Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon 6th \_DSW method is used to prepare
D3cold for the PCIe root port hosting Thunderbolt chain. Because wake is
not enabled \_DSW method is never called and the port does not enter
D3cold properly consuming more power than necessary.
Users can work this around by writing "enabled" to "wakeup" sysfs file
under the device in question but that is not something an ordinary user
is expected to do.
Since we already automatically enable power management for PCIe ports
with ->bridge\_d3 set extend that to enable wake for them as well,
assuming the port has any ACPI wakeup related objects implemented in the
namespace (adev->wakeup.flags.valid is true). This ensures the necessary
ACPI methods get called at appropriate times and allows the root port in
Thinkpad X1 Carbon 6th to go into D3cold.

When adding a VMCI resource, the check for an existing entry
would ignore that the new entry could be a wildcard. This could
result in multiple resource entries that would match a given

refcounting used to ensure that delayed callbacks for VMCI
datagrams have run before the datagram is destroyed can be
wrong, since the refcount could be increased on the duplicate
entry. This in turn leads to a use after free bug. This issue

tpm: suppress transmit cmd error logs when TPM 1.2 is disabled/deactivated
[ Upstream commit 0d6d0d62d9505a9816716aa484ebd0b04c795063 ]
For TPM 1.2 chips the system setup utility allows to set the TPM device in
one of the following states:
\* Active: Security chip is functional
\* Inactive: Security chip is visible, but is not functional
\* Disabled: Security chip is hidden and is not functional
When choosing the "Inactive" state, the TPM 1.2 device is enumerated and
registered, but sending TPM commands fail with either TPM\_DEACTIVATED or
TPM\_DISABLED depending if the firmware deactivated or disabled the TPM.
Since these TPM 1.2 error codes don't have special treatment, inactivating
the TPM leads to a very noisy kernel log buffer that shows messages like
the following:
tpm\_tis 00:05: 1.2 TPM (device-id 0x0, rev-id 78)
tpm tpm0: A TPM error (6) occurred attempting to read a pcr value
tpm tpm0: TPM is disabled/deactivated (0x6)
tpm tpm0: A TPM error (6) occurred attempting get random
tpm tpm0: A TPM error (6) occurred attempting to read a pcr value
ima: No TPM chip found, activating TPM-bypass! (rc=6)
tpm tpm0: A TPM error (6) occurred attempting get random
tpm tpm0: A TPM error (6) occurred attempting get random
tpm tpm0: A TPM error (6) occurred attempting get random
tpm tpm0: A TPM error (6) occurred attempting get random
Let's just suppress error log messages for the TPM\_{DEACTIVATED,DISABLED}
return codes, since this is expected when the TPM 1.2 is set to Inactive.
In that case the kernel log is cleaner and less confusing for users, i.e:
tpm\_tis 00:05: 1.2 TPM (device-id 0x0, rev-id 78)
tpm tpm0: TPM is disabled/deactivated (0x6)
ima: No TPM chip found, activating TPM-bypass! (rc=6)

usb: typec: tcpm: Report back negotiated PPS voltage and current
[ Upstream commit 554fab6dbf20ee7298ed2d4e8398b85e6058abb7 ]
Currently when requesting a specific voltage or current through
the psy interface, for PPS, when reading back from that interface
the values will always be the same as previously given, if the
request was successful. However PPS only allows for 20mV voltage
steps and 50mA current steps, and the psy class expects microvolt
and micro amp requests, so inbetween values can be provided through
this interface. Really when reading back the true values negotiated
should be given, and not the ones originally asked for.
To report the actual values negotiated with the Source, the values
stored are now rounded down to the relevant step units prior to
building the PPS request, so that those values are later correctly
reported through the psy interface. In addition this improves the
adjustments made to meet the operating power requirements of the
platform, which previously could have been slightly out due to not
using valid PPS units of voltage and current.

PCI: mediatek: Fix mtk\_pcie\_find\_port() endpoint/port matching logic
[ Upstream commit 074d6f32689ce05a084b6fa3db38445745bf11cc ]
The Mediatek's host controller has two slots, each with its own control
registers. The host driver needs to identify what slot is connected to
what port in order to access the device's configuration space.
Current code retrieving slot connected to a given endpoint device.
Assuming each slot is connected to one endpoint device as below:
host bridge
bus 0 --> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_|\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
| |
| |
slot 0 slot 1
bus 1 -->| bus 2 --> |
| |
EP 0 EP 1
During PCI enumeration, system software will scan all the PCI devices on
every bus starting from devfn 0. Using PCI\_SLOT(devfn) for matching an
endpoint to its slot is erroneous in that the devfn does not contain the
hierarchical bus numbering in it. In order to match an endpoint with its
slot (and related port), the PCI tree must be walked up to the root bus
(where the root ports are situated) and then the PCI\_SLOT(devfn)
matching logic can be correctly applied for matching.
This patch fixes the mtk\_pcie\_find\_port() slot matching logic by adding
appropriate PCI tree walking code to retrieve the slot/port a given
endpoint is connected to.

scsi: megaraid\_sas: fix a missing-check bug
[ Upstream commit 47db7873136a9c57c45390a53b57019cf73c8259 ]
In megasas\_mgmt\_compat\_ioctl\_fw(), to handle the structure
compat\_megasas\_iocpacket 'cioc', a user-space structure megasas\_iocpacket
'ioc' is allocated before megasas\_mgmt\_ioctl\_fw() is invoked to handle
the packet. Since the two data structures have different fields, the data
is copied from 'cioc' to 'ioc' field by field. In the copy process,
'sense\_ptr' is prepared if the field 'sense\_len' is not null, because it
will be used in megasas\_mgmt\_ioctl\_fw(). To prepare 'sense\_ptr', the
user-space data 'ioc->sense\_off' and 'cioc->sense\_off' are copied and
saved to kernel-space variables 'local\_sense\_off' and 'user\_sense\_off'
respectively. Given that 'ioc->sense\_off' is also copied from
'cioc->sense\_off', 'local\_sense\_off' and 'user\_sense\_off' should have the
same value. However, 'cioc' is in the user space and a malicious user can
race to change the value of 'cioc->sense\_off' after it is copied to
'ioc->sense\_off' but before it is copied to 'user\_sense\_off'. By doing
so, the attacker can inject different values into 'local\_sense\_off' and
'user\_sense\_off'. This can cause undefined behavior in the following
execution, because the two variables are supposed to be same.
This patch enforces a check on the two kernel variables 'local\_sense\_off'
and 'user\_sense\_off' to make sure they are the same after the copy. In
case they are not, an error code EINVAL will be returned.

KVM: nVMX: Clear reserved bits of #DB exit qualification
[ Upstream commit cfb634fe3052aefc4e1360fa322018c9a0b49755 ]
According to volume 3 of the SDM, bits 63:15 and 12:4 of the exit
qualification field for debug exceptions are reserved (cleared to
0). However, the SDM is incorrect about bit 16 (corresponding to
DR6.RTM). This bit should be set if a debug exception (#DB) or a
breakpoint exception (#BP) occurred inside an RTM region while
advanced debugging of RTM transactional regions was enabled. Note that
this is the opposite of DR6.RTM, which "indicates (when clear) that a
debug exception (#DB) or breakpoint exception (#BP) occurred inside an
RTM region while advanced debugging of RTM transactional regions was
enabled."
There is still an issue with stale DR6 bits potentially being
misreported for the current debug exception. DR6 should not have been
modified before vectoring the #DB exception, and the "new DR6 bits"
should be available somewhere, but it was and they aren't.

UAPI: ndctl: Fix g++-unsupported initialisation in headers
[ Upstream commit 9607871f37dc3e717639694b8d0dc738f2a68efc ]
The following code in the linux/ndctl header file:
static inline const char \*nvdimm\_bus\_cmd\_name(unsigned cmd)
{
static const char \* const names[] = {
[ND\_CMD\_ARS\_CAP] = "ars\_cap",
[ND\_CMD\_ARS\_START] = "ars\_start",
[ND\_CMD\_ARS\_STATUS] = "ars\_status",
[ND\_CMD\_CLEAR\_ERROR] = "clear\_error",
[ND\_CMD\_CALL] = "cmd\_call",
};
if (cmd < ARRAY\_SIZE(names) && names[cmd])
return names[cmd];
return "unknown";
}
is broken in a number of ways:
(1) ARRAY\_SIZE() is not generally defined.
(2) g++ does not support "non-trivial" array initialisers fully yet.
(3) Every file that calls this function will acquire a copy of names[].
The same goes for nvdimm\_cmd\_name().
Fix all three by converting to a switch statement where each case returns a
string. That way if cmd is a constant, the compiler can trivially reduce it
and, if not, the compiler can use a shared lookup table if it thinks that is
more efficient.
A better way would be to remove these functions and their arrays from the
header entirely.

scsi: ufs: Schedule clk gating work on correct queue

With commit 10e5e37581fc ("scsi: ufs: Add clock ungating to a separate

WQ\_MEM\_RECLAIM set, since clock gating could occur from a memory reclaim
context. Unfortunately, clk\_gating.gate\_work was left queued via
schedule\_delayed\_work, which is a system workqueue that does not have
WQ\_MEM\_RECLAIM set. Because ufshcd\_ungate\_work attempts to cancel
gate\_work, the following warning appears:

scsi: esp\_scsi: Track residual for PIO transfers
[ Upstream commit fd47d919d0c336e7c22862b51ee94927ffea227a ]
If a target disconnects during a PIO data transfer the command may fail
when the target reconnects:
scsi host1: DMA length is zero!
scsi host1: cur adr[04380000] len[00000000]
The scsi bus is then reset. This happens because the residual reached
zero before the transfer was completed.
The usual residual calculation relies on the Transfer Count registers.
That works for DMA transfers but not for PIO transfers. Fix the problem
by storing the PIO transfer residual and using that to correctly
calculate bytes\_sent.

f2fs: fix to account IO correctly for cgroup writeback
[ Upstream commit 78efac537de33faab9a4302cc05a70bb4a8b3b63 ]
Now, we have supported cgroup writeback, it depends on correctly IO
account of specified filesystem.
But in commit d1b3e72d5490 ("f2fs: submit bio of in-place-update pages"),
we split write paths from f2fs\_submit\_page\_mbio() to two:
- f2fs\_submit\_page\_bio() for IPU path
- f2fs\_submit\_page\_bio() for OPU path
But still we account write IO only in f2fs\_submit\_page\_mbio(), result in
incorrect IO account, fix it by adding missing IO account in IPU path.

net: stmmac: dwmac-sun8i: fix OF child-node lookup
[ Upstream commit ac63043d8cb5503c7e0fe110f947eacf2663804e ]
Use the new of\_get\_compatible\_child() helper to lookup the mdio-internal
child node instead of using of\_find\_compatible\_node(), which searches
the entire tree from a given start node and thus can return an unrelated
(i.e. non-child) node.
This also addresses a potential use-after-free (e.g. after probe
deferral) as the tree-wide helper drops a reference to its first
argument (i.e. the mdio-mux node). Fortunately, this was inadvertently
balanced by a failure to drop the mdio-mux reference after lookup.
While at it, also fix the related mdio-internal- and phy-node reference
leaks.

cifs: fix a credits leak for compund commands
[ Upstream commit cb5c2e63948451d38c977685fffc06e23beb4517 ]
When processing the mids for compounds we would only add credits based on
the last successful mid in the compound which would leak credits and
eventually triggering a re-connect.
Fix this by splitting the mid processing part into two loops instead of one
where the first loop just waits for all mids and then counts how many
credits we were granted for the whole compound.

ath10k: schedule hardware restart if WMI command times out
[ Upstream commit a9911937e7d332761e8c4fcbc7ba0426bdc3956f ]
When running in AP mode, ath10k sometimes suffers from TX credit
starvation. The issue is hard to reproduce and shows up once in a
few days, but has been repeatedly seen with QCA9882 and a large
range of firmwares, including 10.2.4.70.67.
Once the module is in this state, TX credits are never replenished,
which results in "SWBA overrun" errors, as no beacons can be sent.
Even worse, WMI commands run in a timeout while holding the conf
mutex for three seconds each, making any further operations slow
and the whole system unresponsive.
The firmware/driver never recovers from that state automatically,
and triggering TX flush or warm restarts won't work over WMI. So
issue a hardware restart if a WMI command times out due to missing
TX credits. This implies a connectivity outage of about 1.4s in AP
mode, but brings back the interface and the whole system to a usable
state. WMI command timeouts have not been seen in absent of this
specific issue, so taking such drastic actions seems legitimate.

wil6210: fix RX buffers release and unmap

RX SKBs are released in both wil6210 rmmod and RX handle.
As there is no lock to protect the buffers DMA unmap,
the SKB pointer in buff\_arr is used to check if the buffer
memory was already released.
Setting wil->rx\_buff\_mgmt.buff\_arr[buff\_id].skb to NULL before the DMA
memory unmap will prevent duplicate unmapping of the same memory.

ixgbe: disallow IPsec Tx offload when in SR-IOV mode
[ Upstream commit 47b6f50077e68bcd544f657526dad4bfdce7e87d ]
There seems to be a problem in the x540's internal switch wherein if SR-IOV
mode is enabled and an offloaded IPsec packet is sent to a local VF,
the packet is silently dropped. This might never be a problem as it is
somewhat a corner case, but if someone happens to be using IPsec offload
from the PF to a VF that just happens to get migrated to the local box,
communication will mysteriously fail.
Not good.
A simple way to protect from this is to simply not allow any IPsec offloads
for outgoing packets when num\_vfs != 0. This doesn't help any offloads that
were created before SR-IOV was enabled, but we'll get to that later.

gpio: brcmstb: allow 0 width GPIO banks

Sometimes we have empty banks within the GPIO block. This commit allows
proper handling of 0 width GPIO banks. We handle 0 width GPIO banks by
incrementing the bank and number of GPIOs, but not initializing them.
This will mean a call into the non-existent GPIOs will return an error.
Also remove "GPIO registered" dev print. This information is misleading
since the incremented banks and gpio\_base do not reflect the actual GPIOs
that get initialized. We leave this information out since it is already
printed with dev\_dbg.

net: hns3: Fix for vf vlan delete failed problem
[ Upstream commit 41dafea2af781d8e3ab8626d236b52e4172905a3 ]
There are only 128 entries in vf vlan table, if user has added
more than 128 vlan, fw will ignore it and disable the vf vlan
table. So when user deletes the vlan entry that has not been
set to vf vlan table, fw will return not found result and driver
treat that as error, which will cause vlan delete failed problem.
This patch fixes it by returning ok when fw returns not found
result.

When netdev is down, the stack will delete the vlan from

doing loopback selftest when netdev is down.
This patch fixes it by always preserving vlan 0 in hardware,
because vlan 0 is defalut vlan, which should always be in
hardware.

NOTE: in case it's helpful to someone reading this, the way to tell
whether to do the -EINVAL or not is to look at the PCONFDUMP for a
given attribute. If the last element (has\_arg) is false then you need
to do the -EINVAL trick.
ALSO NOTE: it seems unlikely that the values returned when we try to
get PIN\_CONFIG\_BIAS\_PULL\_UP will actually be printed since "has\_arg"
is false for that one, but I guess it's still fine to return different
values so I kept doing that. It seems like another driver (ssbi-gpio)
uses a custom attribute (PM8XXX\_QCOM\_PULL\_UP\_STRENGTH) for something
similar so maybe a future change should do that here too.

When we don't have the iputils-debuginfo package installed, i.e. when we
don't have the DWARF information needed to resolve ping's samples, we
end up failing this 'perf test' entry:

62: probe libc's inet\_pton & backtrace it with ping : Ok
# rpm -e iputils-debuginfo

Fix it to accept "[unknown]" where the symbol + offset, when resolved,
is expected.
I think this will fail in the other arches as well, but since I can't
test now, I'm leaving s390x and ppc cases as-is.

bpf/verifier: fix verifier instability

Edward Cree says:
In check\_mem\_access(), for the PTR\_TO\_CTX case, after check\_ctx\_access()
has supplied a reg\_type, the other members of the register state are set
appropriately. Previously reg.range was set to 0, but as it is in a
union with reg.map\_ptr, which is larger, upper bytes of the latter were
left in place. This then caused the memcmp() in regsafe() to fail,
preventing some branches from being pruned (and occasionally causing the
same program to take a varying number of processed insns on repeated
verifier runs).

ACPI / LPSS: Add alternative ACPI HIDs for Cherry Trail DMA controllers
[ Upstream commit 240714061c58e6b1abfb3322398a7634151c06cb ]
Bay and Cherry Trail DSTDs represent a different set of devices depending
on which OS the device think it is booting. One set of decices for Windows
and another set of devices for Android which targets the Android-x86 Linux
kernel fork (which e.g. used to have its own display driver instead of
using the i915 driver).
Which set of devices we are actually going to get is out of our control,
this is controlled by the ACPI OSID variable, which gets either set through
an EFI setup option, or sometimes is autodetected. So we need to support
both.
This commit adds support for the 80862286 and 808622C0 ACPI HIDs which we
get for the first resp. second DMA controller on Cherry Trail devices when
OSID is set to Android.

spi: gpio: No MISO does not imply no RX
[ Upstream commit abf5feef3ff0cefade0c76be53b59e55fdd46093 ]
There is a logical problem in spi-gpio with host just
assigning a MOSI line and no MISO: this is interpreted
as the host cannot do RX and the host is flagged with
SPI\_MASTER\_NO\_RX.
This is wrong: since GPIO lines can switch direction,
in 3WIRE operation the host will simply reverse the
direction of the GPIO line and start reading from it,
there is even code for doing this in the driver, but
it went unnoticed because it was tested by using a
master with 4 wires but a device using just 3 wires.
Remove the offending flag.

block, bfq: correctly charge and reset entity service in all cases
[ Upstream commit cbeb869a3d1110450186b738199963c5e68c2a71 ]
BFQ schedules entities (which represent either per-process queues or
groups of queues) as a function of their timestamps. In particular, as
a function of their (virtual) finish times. The finish time of an
entity is computed as a function of the budget assigned to the entity,
assuming, tentatively, that the entity, once in service, will receive
an amount of service equal to its budget. Then, when the entity is
expired because it finishes to be served, this finish time is updated
as a function of the actual service received by the entity. This
allows the entity to be correctly charged with only the service
received, and then to be correctly re-scheduled.
Yet an entity may receive service also while not being the entity in
service (in the scheduling environment of its parent entity), for
several reasons. If the entity remains with no backlog while receiving
this 'unofficial' service, then it is expired. Also on such an
expiration, the finish time of the entity should be updated to account
for only the service actually received by the entity. Unfortunately,
such an update is not performed for an entity expiring without being
the entity in service.
In a similar vein, the service counter of the entity in service is
reset when the entity is expired, to be ready to be used for next
service cycle. This reset too should be performed also in case an
entity is expired because it remains empty after receiving service
while not being the entity in service. But in this case the reset is
not performed.
This commit performs the above update of the finish time and reset of
the service received, also for an entity expiring while not being the
entity in service.

x86: boot: Fix EFI stub alignment
[ Upstream commit 9c1442a9d039a1a3302fa93e9a11001c5f23b624 ]
We currently align the end of the compressed image to a multiple of
16. However, the PE-COFF header included in the EFI stub says that
the file alignment is 32 bytes, and when adding an EFI signature to
the file it must first be padded to this alignment.
sbsigntool commands warn about this:
warning: file-aligned section .text extends beyond end of file
warning: checksum areas are greater than image size. Invalid section table?
Worse, pesign -at least when creating a detached signature- uses the
hash of the unpadded file, resulting in an invalid signature if
padding is required.
Avoid both these problems by increasing alignment to 32 bytes when
CONFIG\_EFI\_STUB is enabled.

efi/x86: Call efi\_parse\_options() from efi\_main()
[ Upstream commit c33ce984435bb6142792802d75513a71e55d1969 ]
Before this commit we were only calling efi\_parse\_options() from
make\_boot\_params(), but make\_boot\_params() only gets called if the
kernel gets booted directly as an EFI executable. So when booted through
e.g. grub we ended up not parsing the commandline in the boot code.
This makes the drivers/firmware/efi/libstub code ignore the "quiet"
commandline argument resulting in the following message being printed:
"EFI stub: UEFI Secure Boot is enabled."
Despite the quiet request. This commits adds an extra call to
efi\_parse\_options() to efi\_main() to make sure that the options are
always processed. This fixes quiet not working.
This also fixes the libstub code ignoring nokaslr and efi=nochunk.

ice: update fw version check logic
[ Upstream commit 396fbf9cab5dc07f8f87773062a8d35f54b40a05 ]
We have MAX\_FW\_API\_VER\_BRANCH, MAX\_FW\_API\_VER\_MAJOR, and
MAX\_FW\_API\_VER\_MINOR that we use in ice\_controlq.h to test when a
firmware version is newer than expected. This is currently tested by
comparing each field separately. Thus, we compare the branch field
against the MAX\_FW\_API\_VER\_BRANCH, and so forth.
This means that currently, if we suppose that the max firmware version
is defined as 0.2.1, i.e.
Then firmware 0.1.3 will fail to load. This is because the minor version
3 is greater than the max minor version 1.
This is not intuitive, because of the notion that increasing the major
firmware version to 2 should mean any firmware version with a major
version is less than 2 should be considered older than 2...
In order to allow both 0.2.1 and 0.1.3 to load, you would have to define
the "max" firmware version as 0.2.3.. It is possible that such
a firmware version doesn't even exist yet!
Fix this by replacing the current logic with an updated check that
behaves as follows:
First, we check the major version. If it is greater than the expected
version, then we prevent driver load. Additionally, a warning message is
logged to indicate to the system administrator that they need to update
their driver. This is now the only case where the driver will refuse to
load.
Second, if the major version is less than the expected version, we log
an information message indicating the NVM should be updated.
Third, if the major version is exact, we'll then check the minor
version. If the minor version is more than two versions less than
expected, we log an information message indicating the NVM should be
updated. If it is more than two versions greater than the expected
version, we log an information message that the driver should be
updated.
To support this, the ice\_aq\_ver\_check function needs its signature
updated to pass the HW structure. Since we now pass this structure,
there is no need to pass the firmware API versions separately.

ice: fix changing of ring descriptor size (ethtool -G)
[ Upstream commit f934bb9b8b6136edd261b2dc2c9ad4dbc39ffc66 ]
rx\_mini\_pending was set to an incorrect value. This was causing EINVAL to
always be returned to 'ethtool -G'. The driver does not support mini or
jumbo rings so the respective settings should be zero.
Also, change the valid range of the number of descriptors in the rings to
make the code simpler and easier for users to understand (this removes the
valid settings of 8 and 16). Add a system log message indicating when the
number is rounded-up from what the user specifies with the 'ethtool -G'
command (i.e. when it is not a multiple of 32), and update the log message
when a user-provided value is out of range to also indicate the stride.

signal: Introduce COMPAT\_SIGMINSTKSZ for use in compat\_sys\_sigaltstack
[ Upstream commit 22839869f21ab3850fbbac9b425ccc4c0023926f ]
The sigaltstack(2) system call fails with -ENOMEM if the new alternative
signal stack is found to be smaller than SIGMINSTKSZ. On architectures
such as arm64, where the native value for SIGMINSTKSZ is larger than
the compat value, this can result in an unexpected error being reported
to a compat task. See, for example:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=904385
This patch fixes the problem by extending do\_sigaltstack to take the
minimum signal stack size as an additional parameter, allowing the
native and compat system call entry code to pass in their respective
values. COMPAT\_SIGMINSTKSZ is just defined as SIGMINSTKSZ if it has not
been defined by the architecture.

nvme: call nvme\_complete\_rq when nvmf\_check\_ready fails for mpath I/O
[ Upstream commit 783f4a4408e1251d17f333ad56abac24dde988b9 ]
When an io is rejected by nvmf\_check\_ready() due to validation of the
controller state, the nvmf\_fail\_nonready\_command() will normally return
BLK\_STS\_RESOURCE to requeue and retry. However, if the controller is
dying or the I/O is marked for NVMe multipath, the I/O is failed so that
the controller can terminate or so that the io can be issued on a
different path. Unfortunately, as this reject point is before the
transport has accepted the command, blk-mq ends up completing the I/O
and never calls nvme\_complete\_rq(), which is where multipath may preserve
or re-route the I/O. The end result is, the device user ends up seeing an
EIO error.
Example: single path connectivity, controller is under load, and a reset
is induced. An I/O is received:
a) while the reset state has been set but the queues have yet to be
stopped; or
b) after queues are started (at end of reset) but before the reconnect
has completed.
The I/O finishes with an EIO status.
This patch makes the following changes:
- Adds the HOST\_PATH\_ERROR pathing status from TP4028
- Modifies the reject point such that it appears to queue successfully,
but actually completes the io with the new pathing status and calls
nvme\_complete\_rq().
- nvme\_complete\_rq() recognizes the new status, avoids resetting the
controller (likely was already done in order to get this new status),
and calls the multipather to clear the current path that errored.
This allows the next command (retry or new command) to select a new
path if there is one.

and calls the acpi\_processor\_ids\_walk() to check the duplicate IDs.
But, the acpi\_processor\_ids\_walk() mistakes the return value. If a
processor is checked, it returns true which causes the walk break
immediately, and other processors will never be checked.
Repace the value with AE\_OK which is the standard acpi\_status value.
And don't abort the namespace walk even on error.

case, we should populate the type of the cache, rather than leave it
undefined.
This fixes the issue where the cacheinfo driver will not populate sysfs
for such caches, resulting in the information missing from utilities like
lstopo and lscpu, thus degrading the user experience.

wlcore: Fix BUG with clear completion on timeout

We do not currently clear wl->elp\_compl on ELP timeout and we have bogus
lingering pointer that wlcore\_irq then will try to access after recovery
is done:
BUG: spinlock bad magic on CPU#1, irq/255-wl12xx/580

After that the system will hang. Let's fix this by adding a flag for
recovery and moving the recovery work call to to the error handling
section.
And we want to set WL1271\_FLAG\_INTENDED\_FW\_RECOVERY and actually clear
it too in wl1271\_recovery\_work() and just downgrade the error to a
warning to prevent overly verbose output.

iwlwifi: mvm: check for n\_profiles validity in EWRD ACPI
[ Upstream commit 2e1976bb75263fbad918e82184b16a23bd721546 ]
When reading the profiles from the EWRD table in ACPI, we loop over
the data and set it into our internal table. We use the number of
profiles specified in ACPI without checking its validity, so if the
ACPI table is corrupted and the number is larger than our array size,
we will try to make an out-of-bounds access.
Fix this by making sure the value specified in the ACPI table is
valid.

iwlwifi: mvm: clear HW\_RESTART\_REQUESTED when stopping the interface
[ Upstream commit 155f7e0441cd121b1e673d465a35e99f4b9b2f0b ]
Fix a bug that happens in the following scenario:
1) suspend without WoWLAN
2) mac80211 calls drv\_stop because of the suspend
3) \_\_iwl\_mvm\_mac\_stop deallocates the aux station
4) during drv\_stop the firmware crashes
5) iwlmvm:
\* sets IWL\_MVM\_STATUS\_HW\_RESTART\_REQUESTED
\* asks mac80211 to kick the restart flow
6) mac80211 puts the restart worker into a freezable
queue which means that the worker will not run for now
since the workqueue is already frozen
7) ...
8) resume
9) mac80211 runs ieee80211\_reconfig as part of the resume
10) mac80211 detects that a restart flow has been requested
and that we are now resuming from suspend and cancels
the restart worker
11) mac80211 calls drv\_start()
12) \_\_iwl\_mvm\_mac\_start checks that IWL\_MVM\_STATUS\_HW\_RESTART\_REQUESTED
clears it, sets IWL\_MVM\_STATUS\_IN\_HW\_RESTART and calls
iwl\_mvm\_restart\_cleanup()
13) iwl\_fw\_error\_dump gets called and accesses the device
to get debug data
14) iwl\_mvm\_up adds the aux station
15) iwl\_mvm\_add\_aux\_sta() allocates an internal station for
the aux station
16) iwl\_mvm\_allocate\_int\_sta() tests IWL\_MVM\_STATUS\_IN\_HW\_RESTART
and doesn't really allocate a station ID for the aux
station
17) a new queue is added for the aux station
Note that steps from 5 to 9 aren't really part of the
problem but were described for the sake of completeness.
Once the iwl\_mvm\_mac\_stop() is called, the device is not
accessible, meaning that step 12) can't succeed and we'll
see the following:
drivers/net/wireless/intel/iwlwifi/pcie/trans.c:2122 iwl\_trans\_pcie\_grab\_nic\_access+0xc0/0x1d6 [iwlwifi]()

The station id of the aux station is set to 0xff in step 3
and because we don't really allocate a new station id for
the auxliary station (as explained in 16), we end up sending
a command to the firmware asking to connect the queue
to station id 0xff. This makes the firmware crash with the
following information:
0x00002093 | ADVANCED\_SYSASSERT

Fix this by clearing IWL\_MVM\_STATUS\_HW\_RESTART\_REQUESTED
in iwl\_mvm\_mac\_stop(). We won't be able to collect debug
data anyway and when we will brought up again, we will
have a clean state from the firmware perspective.
Since we won't have IWL\_MVM\_STATUS\_IN\_HW\_RESTART set in
step 12) we won't get to the 2093 ASSERT either.

iwlwifi: pcie: avoid empty free RB queue
[ Upstream commit 868a1e863f95183f00809363fefba6d4f5bcd116 ]
If all free RB queues are empty, the driver will never restock the
free RB queue. That's because the restocking happens in the Rx flow,
and if the free queue is empty there will be no Rx.
Although there's a background worker (a.k.a. allocator) allocating
memory for RBs so that the Rx handler can restock them, the worker may
run only after the free queue has become empty (and then it is too
late for restocking as explained above).
There is a solution for that called 'emergency': If the number of used
RB's reaches half the amount of all RB's, the Rx handler will not wait
for the allocator but immediately allocate memory for the used RB's
and restock the free queue.
But, since the used RB's is per queue, it may happen that the used
RB's are spread between the queues such that the emergency check will
fail for each of the queues
(and still run out of RBs, causing the above symptom).
To fix it, move to emergency mode if the sum of \*all\* used RBs (for
all Rx queues) reaches half the amount of all RB's

mtd: rawnand: denali: set SPARE\_AREA\_SKIP\_BYTES register to 8 if unset
[ Upstream commit 0d55c668b218a1db68b5044bce4de74e1bd0f0c8 ]
NAND devices need additional data area (OOB) for error correction,
but it is also used for Bad Block Marker (BBM). In many cases, the
first byte in OOB is used for BBM, but the location actually depends
on chip vendors. The NAND controller should preserve the precious
BBM to keep track of bad blocks.
In Denali IP, the SPARE\_AREA\_SKIP\_BYTES register is used to specify
the number of bytes to skip from the start of OOB. The ECC engine
will automatically skip the specified number of bytes when it gets
access to OOB area.
The same value for SPARE\_AREA\_SKIP\_BYTES should be used between
firmware and the operating system if you intend to use the NAND
device across the control hand-off.
In fact, the current denali.c code expects firmware to have already
set the SPARE\_AREA\_SKIP\_BYTES register, then reads the value out.
If no firmware (or bootloader) has initialized the controller, the
register value is zero, which is the default after power-on-reset.
In other words, the Linux driver cannot initialize the controller
by itself.
Some possible solutions are:
[1] Add a DT property to specify the skipped bytes in OOB
[2] Associate the preferred value with compatible
[3] Hard-code the default value in the driver
My first attempt was [1], but in the review process, [3] was suggested
as a counter-implementation.
(https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/983055/)
The default value 8 was chosen to match to the boot ROM of the UniPhier
platform. The preferred value may vary by platform. If so, please
trade up to a different solution.

cpupower crashes on VMWare guests. The guests have the AMD PStateDef MSR
(0xC0010064 + state number) set to zero. As a result fid and did are zero
and the crash occurs because of a divide by zero (cof = fid/did). This
can be prevented by checking the enable bit in the PStateDef MSR before
calculating cof. By doing this the value of pstate[i] remains zero and
the value can be tested before displaying the active Pstates.
Check the enable bit in the PstateDef register for all supported families
and only print out enabled Pstates.

There are two places that strictly require an enum of type

an explicit cast, add a simple function, ep93xx\_dma\_data\_to\_trans\_dir,

lightnvm: pblk: fix race condition on metadata I/O
[ Upstream commit d8adaa3b86324c6186d0adf74bc256bdacfffdb6 ]
In pblk, when a new line is allocated, metadata for the previously
written line is scheduled. This is done through a fixed memory region
that is shared through time and contexts across different lines and
therefore protected by a lock. Unfortunately, this lock is not properly
covering all the metadata used for sharing this memory regions,
resulting in a race condition.
This patch fixes this race condition by protecting this metadata
properly.

pblk exposes a sysfs interface that represents its internal state. Part
of this state is the map bitmap for the current open line, which should
be protected by the line lock to avoid a race when freeing the line
metadata. Currently, it is not.
This patch makes sure that the line state is consistent and NULL
bitmap pointers are not dereferenced.

hwmon: (pwm-fan) Set fan speed to 0 on suspend
[ Upstream commit 95dcd64bc5a27080beaa344edfe5bdcca3d2e7dc ]
Technically this is not required because disabling the PWM should be
enough. However, when support for atomic operations was implemented in
the PWM subsystem, only actual changes to the PWM channel are applied
during pwm\_config(), which means that during after resume from suspend
the old settings won't be applied.
One possible solution is for the PWM driver to implement its own PM
operations such that settings from before suspend get applied on resume.
This has the disadvantage of completely ignoring any particular ordering
requirements that PWM user drivers might have, so it is best to leave it
up to the user drivers to apply the settings that they want at the
appropriate time.
Another way to solve this would be to read back the current state of the
PWM at the time of resume. That way, in case the configuration was lost
during suspend, applying the old settings in PWM user drivers would
actually get them applied because they differ from the current settings.
However, not all PWM drivers support reading the hardware state, and not
all hardware may support it.
The best workaround at this point seems to be to let PWM user drivers
tell the PWM subsystem that the PWM is turned off by, in addition to
disabling it, also setting the duty cycle to 0. This causes the resume
operation to apply a configuration that is different from the current
configuration, resulting in the proper state from before suspend getting
restored.

This commit makes it possible to use devlink to split the 100G CXP
Netronome into two 40G interfaces. Currently when you ask for 2
interfaces, the math in src/nfp\_devlink.c:nfp\_devlink\_port\_split
calculates that you want 5 lanes per port because for some reason
eth\_port.port\_lanes=10 (shouldn't this be 12 for CXP?). What we really
want when asking for 2 breakout interfaces is 4 lanes per port. This
commit makes that happen by calculating based on 8 lanes if 10 are
present.

arm64: cpufeature: ctr: Fix cpu capability check for late CPUs
[ Upstream commit 8ab66cbe63aeaf9e5970fb4aaef1c660fca59321 ]
The matches() routine for a capability must honor the "scope"
passed to it and return the proper results.
i.e, when passed with SCOPE\_LOCAL\_CPU, it should check the
status of the capability on the current CPU. This is used by
verify\_local\_cpu\_capabilities() on a late secondary CPU to make
sure that it's compliant with the established system features.
However, ARM64\_HAS\_CACHE\_{IDC/DIC} always checks the system wide
registers and this could mean that a late secondary CPU could return
"true" (since the CPU hasn't updated the system wide registers yet)
and thus lead the system in an inconsistent state, where
the system assumes it has IDC/DIC feature, while the new CPU
doesn't.

locking/lockdep: Fix debug\_locks off performance problem
[ Upstream commit 9506a7425b094d2f1d9c877ed5a78f416669269b ]
It was found that when debug\_locks was turned off because of a problem
found by the lockdep code, the system performance could drop quite
significantly when the lock\_stat code was also configured into the
kernel. For instance, parallel kernel build time on a 4-socket x86-64
server nearly doubled.
Further analysis into the cause of the slowdown traced back to the
frequent call to debug\_locks\_off() from the \_\_lock\_acquired() function
probably due to some inconsistent lockdep states with debug\_locks
off. The debug\_locks\_off() function did an unconditional atomic xchg
to write a 0 value into debug\_locks which had already been set to 0.
This led to severe cacheline contention in the cacheline that held
debug\_locks. As debug\_locks is being referenced in quite a few different
places in the kernel, this greatly slow down the system performance.
To prevent that trashing of debug\_locks cacheline, lock\_acquired()
and lock\_contended() now checks the state of debug\_locks before
proceeding. The debug\_locks\_off() function is also modified to check
debug\_locks before calling \_\_debug\_locks\_off().

x86/numa\_emulation: Fix uniform-split numa emulation
commit c6ee7a548e2c291398b4f32c1f741c66b9f98e1c upstream.
The numa\_emulation() routine in the 'uniform' case walks through all the
physical 'memblk' instances and divides them into N emulated nodes with
split\_nodes\_size\_interleave\_uniform(). As each physical node is consumed it
is removed from the physical memblk array in the numa\_remove\_memblk\_from()
helper.
Since split\_nodes\_size\_interleave\_uniform() handles advancing the array as
the 'memblk' is consumed it is expected that the base of the array is
always specified as the argument.
Otherwise, on multi-socket (> 2) configurations the uniform-split
capability can generate an invalid numa configuration leading to boot
failures with signatures like the following:

x86/xen: Fix boot loader version reported for PVH guests
commit 357d291ce035d1b757568058f3c9898c60d125b1 upstream.
The boot loader version reported via sysfs is wrong in case of the
kernel being booted via the Xen PVH boot entry. it should be 2.12
(0x020c), but it is reported to be 2.18 (0x0212).
As the current way to set the version is error prone use the more
readable variant (2 << 8) | 12.

x86/speculation: Enable cross-hyperthread spectre v2 STIBP mitigation
commit 53c613fe6349994f023245519265999eed75957f upstream.
STIBP is a feature provided by certain Intel ucodes / CPUs. This feature
(once enabled) prevents cross-hyperthread control of decisions made by
indirect branch predictors.
Enable this feature if
- the CPU is vulnerable to spectre v2
- the CPU supports SMT and has SMT siblings online
- spectre\_v2 mitigation autoselection is enabled (default)
After some previous discussion, this leaves STIBP on all the time, as wrmsr
on crossing kernel boundary is a no-no. This could perhaps later be a bit
more optimized (like disabling it in NOHZ, experiment with disabling it in
idle, etc) if needed.
Note that the synchronization of the mask manipulation via newly added
spec\_ctrl\_mutex is currently not strictly needed, as the only updater is
already being serialized by cpu\_add\_remove\_lock, but let's make this a
little bit more future-proof.

ALSA: hda - Fix incorrect clearance of thinkpad\_acpi hooks
commit 5e93a125f521efd00d71af31c2a301f3d46af48c upstream.
Since the commit c647f806b8c2 ("ALSA: hda - Allow multiple ADCs for
mic mute LED controls") we allow enabling the mic mute LED with
multiple ADCs. The commit changed the function return value to be
zero or a negative error, while this change was overlooked in the
thinkpad\_acpi helper code where it still expects a positive return
value for success. This eventually leads to a NULL dereference on a
system that has only a mic mute LED.
This patch corrects the return value check in the corresponding code
as well.

ALSA: ca0106: Disable IZD on SB0570 DAC to fix audio pops
commit ac237c28d5ac1b241d58b1b7b4b9fa10efb22fb5 upstream.
The Creative Audigy SE (SB0570) card currently exhibits an audible pop
whenever playback is stopped or resumed, or during silent periods of an
audio stream. Initialise the IZD bit to the 0 to eliminate these pops.
The Infinite Zero Detection (IZD) feature on the DAC causes the output
to be shunted to Vcap after 2048 samples of silence. This discharges the
AC coupling capacitor through the output and causes the aforementioned
pop/click noise.
The behaviour of the IZD bit is described on page 15 of the WM8768GEDS
datasheet: "With IZD=1, applying MUTE for 1024 consecutive input samples
will cause all outputs to be connected directly to VCAP. This also
happens if 2048 consecutive zero input samples are applied to all 6
channels, and IZD=0. It will be removed as soon as any channel receives
a non-zero input". I believe the second sentence might be referring to
IZD=1 instead of IZD=0 given the observed behaviour of the card.
This change should make the DAC initialisation consistent with
Creative's Windows driver, as this popping persists when initialising
the card in Linux and soft rebooting into Windows, but is not present on
a cold boot to Windows.

parisc: Fix exported address of os\_hpmc handler
commit 99a3ae51d557d8e38a7aece65678a31f9db215ee upstream.
In the C-code we need to put the physical address of the hpmc handler in
the interrupt vector table (IVA) in order to get HPMCs working. Since
on parisc64 function pointers are indirect (in fact they are function
descriptors) we instead export the address as variable and not as
function.
This reverts a small part of commit f39cce654f9a ("parisc: Add
cfi\_startproc and cfi\_endproc to assembly code").

Fix a long-existing small nasty bug in the map\_pages() implementation which
leads to overwriting already written pte entries with zero, \*if\* map\_pages() is
called a second time with an end address which isn't aligned on a pmd boundry.
This happens for example if we want to remap only the text segment read/write
in order to run alternative patching on the code. Exiting the loop when we
reach the end address fixes this.

kprobes/x86: Use preempt\_enable() in optimized\_callback()

The following commit:
a19b2e3d7839 ("kprobes/x86: Remove IRQ disabling from ftrace-based/optimized kprobesâ)
removed local\_irq\_save/restore() from optimized\_callback(), the handler
might be interrupted by the rescheduling interrupt and might be
rescheduled - so we must not use the preempt\_enable\_no\_resched() macro.
Use preempt\_enable() instead, to not lose preemption events.

acpi, nfit: Fix Address Range Scrub completion tracking
commit d3abaf43bab8d5b0a3c6b982100d9e2be96de4ad upstream.
The Address Range Scrub implementation tried to skip running scrubs
against ranges that were already scrubbed by the BIOS. Unfortunately
that support also resulted in early scrub completions as evidenced by
this debug output from nfit\_test:
nd\_region region9: ARS: range 1 short complete
nd\_region region3: ARS: range 1 short complete
nd\_region region4: ARS: range 2 ARS start (0)
nd\_region region4: ARS: range 2 short complete
...i.e. completions without any indications that the scrub was started.
This state of affairs was hard to see in the code due to the
proliferation of state bits and mistakenly trying to track done state
per-range when the completion is a global property of the bus.
So, kill the four ARS state bits (ARS\_REQ, ARS\_REQ\_REDO, ARS\_DONE, and
ARS\_SHORT), and replace them with just 2 request flags ARS\_REQ\_SHORT and
ARS\_REQ\_LONG. The implementation will still complete and reap the
results of BIOS initiated ARS, but it will not attempt to use that
information to affect the completion status of scrubbing the ranges from
a Linux perspective.
Instead, try to synchronously run a short ARS per range at init time and
schedule a long scrub in the background. If ARS is busy with an ARS
request, schedule both a short and a long scrub for when ARS returns to
idle. This logic also satisfies the intent of what ARS\_REQ\_REDO was
trying to achieve. The new rule is that the REQ flag stays set until the
next successful ars\_start() for that range.
With the new policy that the REQ flags are not cleared until the next
start, the implementation no longer loses requests as can be seen from
the following log:
nd\_region region3: ARS: range 1 ARS start short (0)
nd\_region region9: ARS: range 1 ARS start short (0)
nd\_region region3: ARS: range 1 complete
nd\_region region4: ARS: range 2 ARS start short (0)
nd\_region region9: ARS: range 1 complete
nd\_region region9: ARS: range 1 ARS start long (0)
nd\_region region4: ARS: range 2 complete
nd\_region region3: ARS: range 1 ARS start long (0)
nd\_region region9: ARS: range 1 complete
nd\_region region3: ARS: range 1 complete
nd\_region region4: ARS: range 2 ARS start long (0)
nd\_region region4: ARS: range 2 complete
...note that the nfit\_test emulated driver provides 2 buses, that is why
some of the range indices are duplicated. Notice that each range
now successfully completes a short and long scrub.

ACPICA: AML Parser: fix parse loop to correctly skip erroneous extended opcodes
commit c64baa3a6fa207d112706bc5e7fd645cd8a8663f upstream.
AML opcodes come in two lengths: 1-byte opcodes and 2-byte, extended opcodes.
If an error occurs due to illegal opcodes during table load, the AML parser
needs to continue loading the table. In order to do this, it needs to skip
parsing of the offending opcode and operands associated with that opcode.
This change fixes the AML parse loop to correctly skip parsing of incorrect
extended opcodes. Previously, only the short opcodes were skipped correctly.

ACPICA: AML interpreter: add region addresses in global list during initialization
commit 4abb951b73ff0a8a979113ef185651aa3c8da19b upstream.
The table load process omitted adding the operation region address
range to the global list. This omission is problematic because the OS
queries the global list to check for address range conflicts before
deciding which drivers to load. This commit may result in warning
messages that look like the following:
[ 7.871761] ACPI Warning: system\_IO range 0x00000428-0x0000042F conflicts with op\_region 0x00000400-0x0000047F (\PMIO) (20180531/utaddress-213)
[ 7.871769] ACPI: If an ACPI driver is available for this device, you should use it instead of the native driver
However, these messages do not signify regressions. It is a result of
properly adding address ranges within the global address list.

cpufreq: conservative: Take limits changes into account properly
commit da5e79bc70b84971d2b3a55fb252e34e51d81d48 upstream.
If the policy limits change between invocations of cs\_dbs\_update(),
the requested frequency value stored in dbs\_info may not be updated
and the function may use a stale value of it next time. Moreover, if
idle periods are takem into account by cs\_dbs\_update(), the requested
frequency value stored in dbs\_info may be below the min policy limit,
which is incorrect.
To fix these problems, always update the requested frequency value
in dbs\_info along with the local copy of it when the previous
requested frequency is beyond the policy limits and avoid decreasing
the requested frequency below the min policy limit when taking
idle periods into account.

time, keys (1,128K) to (1,1024K) are flush to the backend device, but
the end key (1,1024K) is not included, since the bellow code:
if (bkey\_cmp(k, refill->end) >= 0) {
ret = MAP\_DONE;
goto out;
}
And in the next time when we refill writeback keybuf again, we searched
key start from (1,1024K), and got a key bigger than it, so the key
(1,1024K) missed.

spi: bcm-qspi: switch back to reading flash using smaller chunks
commit 940ec770c295682993d1cccce3081fd7c74fece8 upstream.
Fixing/optimizing bcm\_qspi\_bspi\_read() performance introduced two
changes:
1) It added a loop to read all requested data using multiple BSPI ops.
2) It bumped max size of a single BSPI block request from 256 to 512 B.
The later change resulted in occasional BSPI timeouts causing a
regression.
For some unknown reason hardware doesn't always handle reads as expected
when using 512 B chunks. In such cases it may happen that BSPI returns
amount of requested bytes without the last 1-3 ones. It provides the
remaining bytes later but doesn't raise an interrupt until another LR
start.
Switching back to 256 B reads fixes that problem and regression.

mtd: spi-nor: fsl-quadspi: Don't let -EINVAL on the bus
commit 000412276370a9bcfec73b3752ceefd9a927f1db upstream.
fsl\_qspi\_get\_seqid() may return -EINVAL, but fsl\_qspi\_init\_ahb\_read()
doesn't check for error codes with the result that -EINVAL could find
itself signalled over the bus.
In conjunction with the LS1046A SoC's A-009283 errata
("Illegal accesses to SPI flash memory can result in a system hang")
this illegal access to SPI flash memory results in a system hang
if userspace attempts reading later on.
Avoid this by always checking fsl\_qspi\_get\_seqid()'s return value

mtd: rawnand: marvell: fix the IRQ handler complete() condition
commit 53c83b59759c1ee213f5ffa194909daee8902a28 upstream.
With the current implementation, the complete() in the IRQ handler is
supposed to be called only if the register status has one or the other
RDY bit set. Other events might trigger an interrupt as well if
enabled, but should not end-up with a complete() call.
For this purpose, the code was checking if the other bits were set, in
this case complete() was not called. This is wrong as two events might
happen in a very tight time-frame and if the NDSR status read reports
two bits set (eg. RDY(0) and RDDREQ) at the same time, complete() was
not called.
This logic would lead to timeouts in marvell\_nfc\_wait\_op() and has
been observed on PXA boards (NFCv1) in the Hamming write path.

gpio: mxs: Get rid of external API call
[ Upstream commit 833eacc7b5913da9896bacd30db7d490aa777868 ]
The MXS driver was calling back into the GPIO API from
its irqchip. This is not very elegant, as we are a driver,
let's just shortcut back into the gpio\_chip .get() function
instead.
This is a tricky case since the .get() callback is not in
this file, instead assigned by bgpio\_init(). Calling the
function direcly in the gpio\_chip is however the lesser
evil.

Commit ea7e0480a4b6 ("MIPS: VDSO: Always map near top of user memory")
set VDSO\_RANDOMIZE\_SIZE to 256MB for 64bit kernel. But take a look at
arch/mips/mm/mmap.c we can see that MIN\_GAP is 128MB, which means the
mmap\_base may be at (user\_address\_top - 128MB). This make the stack be
surrounded by mmaped areas, then stack expanding fails and causes a
segmentation fault. Therefore, VDSO\_RANDOMIZE\_SIZE should be less than
MIN\_GAP and this patch reduce it to 64MB.

bpf: fix partial copy of map\_ptr when dst is scalar
commit 0962590e553331db2cc0aef2dc35c57f6300dbbe upstream.
ALU operations on pointers such as scalar\_reg += map\_value\_ptr are
handled in adjust\_ptr\_min\_max\_vals(). Problem is however that map\_ptr
and range in the register state share a union, so transferring state
through dst\_reg->range = ptr\_reg->range is just buggy as any new
map\_ptr in the dst\_reg is then truncated (or null) for subsequent
checks. Fix this by adding a raw member and use it for copying state
over to dst\_reg.

bpf: wait for running BPF programs when updating map-in-map
commit 1ae80cf31938c8f77c37a29bbe29e7f1cd492be8 upstream.
The map-in-map frequently serves as a mechanism for atomic
snapshotting of state that a BPF program might record. The current
implementation is dangerous to use in this way, however, since
userspace has no way of knowing when all programs that might have
retrieved the "old" value of the map may have completed.
This change ensures that map update operations on map-in-map map types
always wait for all references to the old map to drop before returning
to userspace.

userns: also map extents in the reverse map to kernel IDs
commit d2f007dbe7e4c9583eea6eb04d60001e85c6f1bd upstream.
The current logic first clones the extent array and sorts both copies, then
maps the lower IDs of the forward mapping into the lower namespace, but
doesn't map the lower IDs of the reverse mapping.
This means that code in a nested user namespace with >5 extents will see
incorrect IDs. It also breaks some access checks, like
inode\_owner\_or\_capable() and privileged\_wrt\_inode\_uidgid(), so a process
can incorrectly appear to be capable relative to an inode.
To fix it, we have to make sure that the "lower\_first" members of extents
in both arrays are translated; and we have to make sure that the reverse
map is sorted \*after\* the translation (since otherwise the translation can
break the sorting).
This is CVE-2018-18955.

Btrfs: fix use-after-free during inode eviction
commit 421f0922a2cfb0c75acd9746454aaa576c711a65 upstream.
At inode.c:evict\_inode\_truncate\_pages(), when we iterate over the
inode's extent states, we access an extent state record's "state" field
after we unlocked the inode's io tree lock. This can lead to a
use-after-free issue because after we unlock the io tree that extent
state record might have been freed due to being merged into another
adjacent extent state record (a previous inflight bio for a read
operation finished in the meanwhile which unlocked a range in the io
tree and cause a merge of extent state records, as explained in the
comment before the while loop added in commit 6ca0709756710 ("Btrfs: fix
hang during inode eviction due to concurrent readahead")).
Fix this by keeping a copy of the extent state's flags in a local
variable and using it after unlocking the io tree.

btrfs: move the dio\_sem higher up the callchain
commit c495144bc6962186feae31d687596d2472000e45 upstream.
We're getting a lockdep splat because we take the dio\_sem under the
log\_mutex. What we really need is to protect fsync() from logging an
extent map for an extent we never waited on higher up, so just guard the
whole thing with dio\_sem.

btrfs: fix insert\_reserved error handling
commit 80ee54bfe8a3850015585ebc84e8d207fcae6831 upstream.
We were not handling the reserved byte accounting properly for data
references. Metadata was fine, if it errored out the error paths would
free the bytes\_reserved count and pin the extent, but it even missed one
of the error cases. So instead move this handling up into
run\_one\_delayed\_ref so we are sure that both cases are properly cleaned
up in case of a transaction abort.

btrfs: only free reserved extent if we didn't insert it
commit 49940bdd57779c78462da7aa5a8650b2fea8c2ff upstream.
When we insert the file extent once the ordered extent completes we free
the reserved extent reservation as it'll have been migrated to the
bytes\_used counter. However if we error out after this step we'll still
clear the reserved extent reservation, resulting in a negative
accounting of the reserved bytes for the block group and space info.
Fix this by only doing the free if we didn't successfully insert a file
extent for this extent.

commit fb5c39d7a887108087de6ff93d3f326b01b4ef41 upstream.
max\_extent\_size is supposed to be the largest contiguous range for the
space info, and ctl->free\_space is the total free space in the block
group. We need to keep track of these separately and \_only\_ use the
max\_free\_space if we don't have a max\_extent\_size, as that means our
original request was too large to search any of the block groups for and
therefore wouldn't have a max\_extent\_size set.

This is because at write\_one\_cache\_group() when we are COWing a leaf from
the extent tree we end up allocating a new block group (chunk) and,
because we have hit a threshold on the number of bytes reserved for system
chunks, we attempt to finalize the creation of new block groups from the
current transaction, by calling btrfs\_create\_pending\_block\_groups().
However here we also need to modify the extent tree in order to insert
a block group item, and if the location for this new block group item
happens to be in the same leaf that we were COWing earlier, we deadlock
since btrfs\_search\_slot() tries to write lock the extent buffer that we
locked before at write\_one\_cache\_group().
We have already hit similar cases in the past and commit d9a0540a79f8
("Btrfs: fix deadlock when finalizing block group creation") fixed some
of those cases by delaying the creation of pending block groups at the
known specific spots that could lead to a deadlock. This change reworks
that commit to be more generic so that we don't have to add similar logic
to every possible path that can lead to a deadlock. This is done by
making \_\_btrfs\_cow\_block() disallowing the creation of new block groups
(setting the transaction's can\_flush\_pending\_bgs to false) before it
attempts to allocate a new extent buffer for either the extent, chunk or
device trees, since those are the trees that pending block creation
modifies. Once the new extent buffer is allocated, it allows creation of
pending block groups to happen again.
This change depends on a recent patch from Josef which is not yet in
Linus' tree, named "btrfs: make sure we create all new block groups" in
order to avoid occasional warnings at btrfs\_trans\_release\_chunk\_metadata().

Btrfs: fix assertion on fsync of regular file when using no-holes feature
commit 7ed586d0a8241e81d58c656c5b315f781fa6fc97 upstream.
When using the NO\_HOLES feature and logging a regular file, we were
expecting that if we find an inline extent, that either its size in RAM
(uncompressed and unenconded) matches the size of the file or if it does
not, that it matches the sector size and it represents compressed data.
This assertion does not cover a case where the length of the inline extent
is smaller than the sector size and also smaller the file's size, such
case is possible through fallocate. Example:
$ mkfs.btrfs -f -O no-holes /dev/sdb
$ mount /dev/sdb /mnt
$ xfs\_io -f -c "pwrite -S 0xb60 0 21" /mnt/foobar
$ xfs\_io -c "falloc 40 40" /mnt/foobar
$ xfs\_io -c "fsync" /mnt/foobar
In the above example we trigger the assertion because the inline extent's
length is 21 bytes while the file size is 80 bytes. The fallocate() call
merely updated the file's size and did not touch the existing inline
extent, as expected.
So fix this by adjusting the assertion so that an inline extent length
smaller than the file size is valid if the file size is smaller than the
filesystem's sector size.
A test case for fstests follows soon.

Btrfs: fix null pointer dereference on compressed write path error
commit 3527a018c00e5dbada2f9d7ed5576437b6dd5cfb upstream.
At inode.c:compress\_file\_range(), under the "free\_pages\_out" label, we can
end up dereferencing the "pages" pointer when it has a NULL value. This
case happens when "start" has a value of 0 and we fail to allocate memory
for the "pages" pointer. When that happens we jump to the "cont" label and
then enter the "if (start == 0)" branch where we immediately call the
cow\_file\_range\_inline() function. If that function returns 0 (success
creating an inline extent) or an error (like -ENOMEM for example) we jump
to the "free\_pages\_out" label and then access "pages[i]" leading to a NULL
pointer dereference, since "nr\_pages" has a value greater than zero at
that point.
Fix this by setting "nr\_pages" to 0 when we fail to allocate memory for
the "pages" pointer.

1/0 1016.00KiB 16.00KiB none none --- ---
^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^ not cleared
[CAUSE]
Before rescan we call qgroup\_rescan\_zero\_tracking() to zero out all
qgroups' accounting numbers.
However we don't mark all qgroups dirty, but rely on rescan to do so.
If we have any high level qgroup without children, it won't be marked
dirty during rescan, since we cannot reach that qgroup.
This will cause QGROUP\_INFO items of childless qgroups never get updated
in the quota tree, thus their numbers will stay the same in "btrfs
qgroup show" output.
[FIX]
Just mark all qgroups dirty in qgroup\_rescan\_zero\_tracking(), so even if
we have childless qgroups, their QGROUP\_INFO items will still get
updated during rescan.

Btrfs: fix wrong dentries after fsync of file that got its parent replaced
commit 0f375eed92b5a407657532637ed9652611a682f5 upstream.
In a scenario like the following:
mkdir /mnt/A # inode 258
mkdir /mnt/B # inode 259
touch /mnt/B/bar # inode 260
sync
mv /mnt/B/bar /mnt/A/bar
mv -T /mnt/A /mnt/B
fsync /mnt/B/bar
After replaying the log we end up with file bar having 2 hard links, both
with the name 'bar' and one in the directory with inode number 258 and the
other in the directory with inode number 259. Also, we end up with the
directory inode 259 still existing and with the directory inode 258 still
named as 'A', instead of 'B'. In this scenario, file 'bar' should only
have one hard link, located at directory inode 258, the directory inode
259 should not exist anymore and the name for directory inode 258 should
be 'B'.
This incorrect behaviour happens because when attempting to log the old
parents of an inode, we skip any parents that no longer exist. Fix this
by forcing a full commit if an old parent no longer exists.
A test case for fstests follows soon.

This happens because the inode does not have the flag I\_LINKABLE set,
which is a runtime only flag, not meant to be persisted, set when the
inode is created through open(2) if the flag O\_EXCL is not passed to it.
Except for the warning, there are no other consequences (like corruptions
or metadata inconsistencies).
Since it's pointless to replay a tmpfile as it would be deleted in a
later phase of the log replay procedure (it has a link count of 0), fix
this by not logging tmpfiles and if a tmpfile is found in a log (created
by a kernel without this change), skip the replay of the inode.
A test case for fstests follows soon.

btrfs: make sure we create all new block groups
commit 545e3366db823dc3342ca9d7fea803f829c9062f upstream.
Allocating new chunks modifies both the extent and chunk tree, which can
trigger new chunk allocations. So instead of doing list\_for\_each\_safe,
just do while (!list\_empty()) so we make sure we don't exit with other
pending bg's still on our list.

If we're allocating a new space cache inode it's likely going to be

Btrfs: don't clean dirty pages during buffered writes
commit 7703bdd8d23e6ef057af3253958a793ec6066b28 upstream.
During buffered writes, we follow this basic series of steps:
again:
lock all the pages
wait for writeback on all the pages
Take the extent range lock
wait for ordered extents on the whole range
clean all the pages
if (copy\_from\_user\_in\_atomic() hits a fault) {
drop our locks
goto again;
}
dirty all the pages
release all the locks
The extra waiting, cleaning and locking are there to make sure we don't
modify pages in flight to the drive, after they've been crc'd.
If some of the pages in the range were already dirty when the write
began, and we need to goto again, we create a window where a dirty page
has been cleaned and unlocked. It may be reclaimed before we're able to
lock it again, which means we'll read the old contents off the drive and
lose any modifications that had been pending writeback.
We don't actually need to clean the pages. All of the other locking in
place makes sure we don't start IO on the pages, so we can just leave
them dirty for the duration of the write.

btrfs: wait on caching when putting the bg cache
commit 3aa7c7a31c26321696b92841d5103461c6f3f517 upstream.
While testing my backport I noticed there was a panic if I ran
generic/416 generic/417 generic/418 all in a row. This just happened to
uncover a race where we had outstanding IO after we destroy all of our
workqueues, and then we'd go to queue the endio work on those free'd
workqueues.
This is because we aren't waiting for the caching threads to be done
before freeing everything up, so to fix this make sure we wait on any
outstanding caching that's being done before we free up the block group,
so we're sure to be done with all IO by the time we get to
btrfs\_stop\_all\_workers(). This fixes the panic I was seeing
consistently in testing.

btrfs: keep trim from interfering with transaction commits
commit fee7acc361314df6561208c2d3c0882d663dd537 upstream.
Commit 499f377f49f08 (btrfs: iterate over unused chunk space in FITRIM)
fixed free space trimming, but introduced latency when it was running.
This is due to it pinning the transaction using both a incremented
refcount and holding the commit root sem for the duration of a single
trim operation.
This was to ensure safety but it's unnecessary. We already hold the the
chunk mutex so we know that the chunk we're using can't be allocated
while we're trimming it.
In order to check against chunks allocated already in this transaction,
we need to check the pending chunks list. To to that safely without
joining the transaction (or attaching than then having to commit it) we
need to ensure that the dev root's commit root doesn't change underneath
us and the pending chunk lists stays around until we're done with it.
We can ensure the former by holding the commit root sem and the latter
by pinning the transaction. We do this now, but the critical section
covers the trim operation itself and we don't need to do that.
This patch moves the pinning and unpinning logic into helpers and unpins
the transaction after performing the search and check for pending
chunks.
Limiting the critical section of the transaction pinning improves the
latency substantially on slower storage (e.g. image files over NFS).

btrfs: don't attempt to trim devices that don't support it
commit 0be88e367fd8fbdb45257615d691f4675dda062f upstream.
We check whether any device the file system is using supports discard in
the ioctl call, but then we attempt to trim free extents on every device
regardless of whether discard is supported. Due to the way we mask off
EOPNOTSUPP, we can end up issuing the trim operations on each free range
on devices that don't support it, just wasting time.

btrfs: iterate all devices during trim, instead of fs\_devices::alloc\_list
commit d4e329de5e5e21594df2e0dd59da9acee71f133b upstream.
btrfs\_trim\_fs iterates over the fs\_devices->alloc\_list while holding the
device\_list\_mutex. The problem is that ->alloc\_list is protected by the
chunk mutex. We don't want to hold the chunk mutex over the trim of the
entire file system. Fortunately, the ->dev\_list list is protected by
the dev\_list mutex and while it will give us all devices, including
read-only devices, we already just skip the read-only devices. Then we
can continue to take and release the chunk mutex while scanning each
device.

btrfs: Ensure btrfs\_trim\_fs can trim the whole filesystem
commit 6ba9fc8e628becf0e3ec94083450d089b0dec5f5 upstream.
[BUG]
fstrim on some btrfs only trims the unallocated space, not trimming any
space in existing block groups.
[CAUSE]
Before fstrim\_range passed to btrfs\_trim\_fs(), it gets truncated to
range [0, super->total\_bytes). So later btrfs\_trim\_fs() will only be
able to trim block groups in range [0, super->total\_bytes).
While for btrfs, any bytenr aligned to sectorsize is valid, since btrfs
uses its logical address space, there is nothing limiting the location
where we put block groups.
For filesystem with frequent balance, it's quite easy to relocate all
block groups and bytenr of block groups will start beyond
super->total\_bytes.
In that case, btrfs will not trim existing block groups.
[FIX]
Just remove the truncation in btrfs\_ioctl\_fitrim(), so btrfs\_trim\_fs()
can get the unmodified range, which is normally set to [0, U64\_MAX].

btrfs: Enhance btrfs\_trim\_fs function to handle error better
commit 93bba24d4b5ad1e5cd8b43f64e66ff9d6355dd20 upstream.
Function btrfs\_trim\_fs() doesn't handle errors in a consistent way. If
error happens when trimming existing block groups, it will skip the
remaining blocks and continue to trim unallocated space for each device.
The return value will only reflect the final error from device trimming.
This patch will fix such behavior by:
1) Recording the last error from block group or device trimming
The return value will also reflect the last error during trimming.
Make developer more aware of the problem.
2) Continuing trimming if possible
If we failed to trim one block group or device, we could still try
the next block group or device.
3) Report number of failures during block group and device trimming
It would be less noisy, but still gives user a brief summary of
what's going wrong.
Such behavior can avoid confusion for cases like failure to trim the
first block group and then only unallocated space is trimmed.

btrfs: fix error handling in btrfs\_dev\_replace\_start
commit 5c06147128fbbdf7a84232c5f0d808f53153defe upstream.
When we fail to start a transaction in btrfs\_dev\_replace\_start, we leave
dev\_replace->replace\_start set to STARTED but clear ->srcdev and
->tgtdev. Later, that can result in an Oops in
btrfs\_dev\_replace\_progress when having state set to STARTED or SUSPENDED
implies that ->srcdev is valid.
Also fix error handling when the state is already STARTED or SUSPENDED
while starting. That, too, will clear ->srcdev and ->tgtdev even though
it doesn't own them. This should be an impossible case to hit since we
should be protected by the BTRFS\_FS\_EXCL\_OP bit being set. Let's add an
ASSERT there while we're at it.

btrfs: locking: Add extra check in btrfs\_init\_new\_buffer() to avoid deadlock
commit b72c3aba09a53fc7c1824250d71180ca154517a7 upstream.
[BUG]
For certain crafted image, whose csum root leaf has missing backref, if
we try to trigger write with data csum, it could cause deadlock with the
following kernel WARN\_ON():
WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 41 at fs/btrfs/locking.c:230 btrfs\_tree\_lock+0x3e2/0x400

kthread+0x180/0x1d0

[CAUSE]
That crafted image has missing backref for csum tree root leaf. And
when we try to allocate new tree block, since there is no
EXTENT/METADATA\_ITEM for csum tree root, btrfs consider it's free slot
and use it.
The extent tree of the image looks like:
Normal image | This fuzzed image
----------------------------------+--------------------------------
BG 29360128 | BG 29360128
One empty slot | One empty slot
29364224: backref to UUID tree | 29364224: backref to UUID tree
Two empty slots | Two empty slots
29376512: backref to CSUM tree | One empty slot (bad type) <<<
29380608: backref to D\_RELOC tree | 29380608: backref to D\_RELOC tree
... | ...
Since bytenr 29376512 has no METADATA/EXTENT\_ITEM, when btrfs try to
alloc tree block, it's an valid slot for btrfs.
And for finish\_ordered\_write, when we need to insert csum, we try to CoW
csum tree root.
By accident, empty slots at bytenr BG\_OFFSET, BG\_OFFSET + 8K,
BG\_OFFSET + 12K is already used by tree block COW for other trees, the
next empty slot is BG\_OFFSET + 16K, which should be the backref for CSUM
tree.
But due to the bad type, btrfs can recognize it and still consider it as
an empty slot, and will try to use it for csum tree CoW.
Then in the following call trace, we will try to lock the new tree
block, which turns out to be the old csum tree root which is already
locked:
btrfs\_search\_slot() called on csum tree root, which is at 29376512
|- btrfs\_cow\_block()
|- btrfs\_set\_lock\_block()
| |- Now locks tree block 29376512 (old csum tree root)
|- \_\_btrfs\_cow\_block()
|- btrfs\_alloc\_tree\_block()
|- btrfs\_reserve\_extent()
| Now it returns tree block 29376512, which extent tree
| shows its empty slot, but it's already hold by csum tree
|- btrfs\_init\_new\_buffer()
|- btrfs\_tree\_lock()
| Triggers WARN\_ON(eb->lock\_owner == current->pid)
|- wait\_event()
Wait lock owner to release the lock, but it's
locked by ourself, so it will deadlock
[FIX]
This patch will do the lock\_owner and current->pid check at
btrfs\_init\_new\_buffer().
So above deadlock can be avoided.
Since such problem can only happen in crafted image, we will still
trigger kernel warning for later aborted transaction, but with a little
more meaningful warning message.

btrfs: Handle owner mismatch gracefully when walking up tree
commit 65c6e82becec33731f48786e5a30f98662c86b16 upstream.
[BUG]
When mounting certain crafted image, btrfs will trigger kernel BUG\_ON()

[CAUSE]
Extent tree corruption. In this particular case, reloc tree root's
owner is DATA\_RELOC\_TREE (should be TREE\_RELOC), thus its backref is
corrupted and we failed the owner check in walk\_up\_tree().
[FIX]
It's pretty hard to take care of every extent tree corruption, but at
least we can remove such BUG\_ON() and exit more gracefully.
And since in this particular image, DATA\_RELOC\_TREE and TREE\_RELOC share
the same root (which is obviously invalid), we needs to make
\_\_del\_reloc\_root() more robust to detect such invalid sharing to avoid
possible NULL dereference as root->node can be NULL in this case.

btrfs: qgroup: Avoid calling qgroup functions if qgroup is not enabled
commit 3628b4ca64f24a4ec55055597d0cb1c814729f8b upstream.
Some qgroup trace events like btrfs\_qgroup\_release\_data() and
btrfs\_qgroup\_free\_delayed\_ref() can still be triggered even if qgroup is
not enabled.
This is caused by the lack of qgroup status check before calling some
qgroup functions. Thankfully the functions can handle quota disabled
case well and just do nothing for qgroup disabled case.
This patch will do earlier check before triggering related trace events.
And for enabled <-> disabled race case:
1) For enabled->disabled case
Disable will wipe out all qgroups data including reservation and
excl/rfer. Even if we leak some reservation or numbers, it will
still be cleared, so nothing will go wrong.
2) For disabled -> enabled case
Current btrfs\_qgroup\_release\_data() will use extent\_io tree to ensure
we won't underflow reservation. And for delayed\_ref we use
head->qgroup\_reserved to record the reserved space, so in that case
head->qgroup\_reserved should be 0 and we won't underflow.

selftests/powerpc: Fix ptrace tm failure
commit 48dc0ef19044bfb69193302fbe3a834e3331b7ae upstream.
Test ptrace-tm-spd-gpr fails on current kernel (4.19) due to a segmentation
fault that happens on the child process prior to setting cptr[2] = 1. This
causes the parent process to wait forever at 'while (!pptr[2])' and the test to
be killed by the test harness framework by timeout, thus, failing.
The segmentation fault happens because of a inline assembly being
generated as:
0x10000355c  lfs f0, 0(0)
This is reading memory position 0x0 and causing the segmentation fault.
This code is being generated by ASM\_LOAD\_FPR\_SINGLE\_PRECISION(flt\_4), where
flt\_4 is passed to the inline assembly block as:
[flt\_4] "r" (&d)
Since the inline assembly 'r' constraint means any GPR, gpr0 is being
chosen, thus causing this issue when issuing a Load Floating-Point Single
instruction.
This patch simply changes the constraint to 'b', which specify that this
register will be used as base, and r0 is not allowed to be used, avoiding
this issue.
Other than that, removing flt\_2 register from the input operands, since it
is not used by the inline assembly code at all.

selftests/ftrace: Fix synthetic event test to delete event correctly
commit 0d0352d8b3d6d7ca9a710b40e194cbbaeb841c88 upstream.
Fix the synthetic event test case to remove event correctly.
If redirecting command to synthetic\_event file without append
mode, it cleans up all existing events and execute (parse) the
command. This means "delete event" always fails to find the
target event.
Since previous synthetic event has a bug which doesn't return
-ENOENT even if it fails to find the deleting event, this test
passed. But fixing that bug, this test fails because this test
itself has a bug.
This fixes that bug by trying to delete event right after
adding an event, and use append mode redirection ('>>') instead
of normal redirection ('>').

ret to -ENOMEM and jumping to an exit path that kfree's channel.

arm64: lse: remove -fcall-used-x0 flag
commit 2a6c7c367de82951c98a290a21156770f6f82c84 upstream.
x0 is not callee-saved in the PCS. So there is no need to specify
-fcall-used-x0.
Clang doesn't currently support -fcall-used flags. This patch will help
building the kernel with clang.

drm/mediatek: fix OF sibling-node lookup
commit ceff2f4dcd44abf35864d9a99f85ac619e89a01d upstream.
Use the new of\_get\_compatible\_child() helper to lookup the sibling
instead of using of\_find\_compatible\_node(), which searches the entire
tree from a given start node and thus can return an unrelated (i.e.
non-sibling) node.
This also addresses a potential use-after-free (e.g. after probe
deferral) as the tree-wide helper drops a reference to its first
argument (i.e. the parent device node).
While at it, also fix the related cec-node reference leak.

If the wait for completion was interrupted, then make sure to cancel
any delayed work.
This can only happen if a transmit is waiting for a reply, and you press
Ctrl-C or reboot/poweroff or something like that which interrupts the
thread waiting for the reply and then proceeds to delete the CEC message.
Since the delayed work wasn't canceled, once it would trigger it referred
to stale data and resulted in a kernel oops.

commit 7d867a1b765e2b70815fec4964d7822a976ed349 upstream.
The calculation of the Signal Free Time in the framework was not
correct. If a message was received, then the next transmit should be
considered a New Initiator and use a shorter SFT value.
This was not done with the result that if both sides where continually
sending messages, they both could use the same SFT value and one side
could deny the other side access to the bus.
Note that this fix does not take the corner case into account where
a receive is in progress when you call adap\_transmit.

commit 7ec2b3b941a666a942859684281b5f6460a0c234 upstream.
If the HDMI cable is disconnected or the CEC adapter is manually
unconfigured, then all pending transmits and wait-for-replies are
aborted. Signal this with new status bits (CEC\_RX/TX\_STATUS\_ABORTED).
If due to (usually) a driver bug a transmit never ends (i.e. the
transmit\_done was never called by the driver), then when this times
out the message is marked with CEC\_TX\_STATUS\_TIMEOUT.
This should not happen and is an indication of a driver bug.
Without a separate status bit for this it was impossible to detect
this from userspace.
The 'transmit timed out' kernel message is now a warning, so this
should be more prominent in the kernel log as well.

xen: remove size limit of privcmd-buf mapping interface
commit 3941552aec1e04d63999988a057ae09a1c56ebeb upstream.
Currently the size of hypercall buffers allocated via
/dev/xen/hypercall is limited to a default of 64 memory pages. For live
migration of guests this might be too small as the page dirty bitmask
needs to be sized according to the size of the guest. This means
migrating a 8GB sized guest is already exhausting the default buffer
size for the dirty bitmap.
There is no sensible way to set a sane limit, so just remove it
completely. The device node's usage is limited to root anyway, so there
is no additional DOS scenario added by allowing unlimited buffers.
While at it make the error path for the -ENOMEM case a little bit
cleaner by setting n\_pages to the number of successfully allocated
pages instead of the target size.

Commit a856531951dc80 ("xen: make xen\_qlock\_wait() nestable")
introduced a regression for Xen guests running fully virtualized
(HVM or PVH mode). The Xen hypervisor wouldn't return from the poll
hypercall with interrupts disabled in case of an interrupt (for PV
guests it does).
So instead of disabling interrupts in xen\_qlock\_wait() use a nesting
counter to avoid calling xen\_clear\_irq\_pending() in case
xen\_qlock\_wait() is nested.

kgdboc: Passing ekgdboc to command line causes panic
commit 1bd54d851f50dea6af30c3e6ff4f3e9aab5558f9 upstream.
kgdboc\_option\_setup does not check input argument before passing it
to strlen. The argument would be a NULL pointer if "ekgdboc", without
its value, is set in command line and thus cause the following panic.

Revert "media: dvbsky: use just one mutex for serializing device R/W ops"
commit 9afc82194de9a1ce298f0d77d7d779d585bf962c upstream.
As pointed at:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=199323
This patch causes a bad effect on RPi. I suspect that the root
cause is at the USB out of tree RPi driver, with uses high priority
interrupts instead of normal ones. Anyway, as this patch
is mostly a cleanup, better to revert it.
This reverts commit 7d95fb746c4eece67308f1642a666ea1ebdbd2cc.

When the OSD is on (i.e. vivid displays text on top of the test pattern), and
you enable hflip, then the driver crashes.
The cause turned out to be a division of a negative number by an unsigned value.
You expect that -8 / 2U would be -4, but in reality it is 2147483644 :-(

Use the new of\_get\_compatible\_child() helper to lookup the mdio child

entire tree from a given start node and thus can return an unrelated
(i.e. non-child) node.
This also addresses a potential use-after-free (e.g. after probe

This is because the TURBOchannel bus driver fails to set the coherent
DMA mask for devices enumerated.
Set the regular and coherent DMA masks for TURBOchannel devices then,
observing that the bus protocol supports a 34-bit (16GiB) DMA address
space, by interpreting the value presented in the address cycle across
the 32 `ad' lines as a 32-bit word rather than byte address[1]. The
architectural size of the TURBOchannel DMA address space exceeds the
maximum amount of RAM any actual TURBOchannel system in existence may
have, hence both masks are the same.
This removes the warning shown above.

iommu/arm-smmu: Ensure that page-table updates are visible before TLBI
commit 7d321bd3542500caf125249f44dc37cb4e738013 upstream.
The IO-pgtable code relies on the driver TLB invalidation callbacks to
ensure that all page-table updates are visible to the IOMMU page-table
walker.
In the case that the page-table walker is cache-coherent, we cannot rely
on an implicit DSB from the DMA-mapping code, so we must ensure that we
execute a DSB in our tlb\_add\_flush() callback prior to triggering the
invalidation.

ocxl: Fix access to the AFU Descriptor Data
commit 6f8e45f7eb1bee5efdbe4a9cfe4a45627403c5fb upstream.
The AFU Information DVSEC capability is a means to extract common,
general information about all of the AFUs associated with a Function
independent of the specific functionality that each AFU provides.
Write in the AFU Index field allows to access to the descriptor data
for each AFU.
With the current code, we are not able to access to these specific data
when the index >= 1 because we are writing to the wrong location.
All requests to the data of each AFU are pointing to those of the AFU 0,
which could have impacts when using a card with more than one AFU per
function.
This patch fixes the access to the AFU Descriptor Data indexed by the
AFU Info Index field.

While at it, also fix the related phy-node reference leak.

Fix a problem with commit 311ee9c151ad ("rtc: cmos: allow using ACPI for

even for non-ACPI platforms, which ignore it. Wrap the definition into
#ifdef CONFIG\_ACPI and use a static inline wrapper function, hardcoded
to return 0 and consequently optimized away for !ACPI, following the

rtc: cmos: Fix non-ACPI undefined reference to `hpet\_rtc\_interrupt'
commit d197a253855d2d8e507a003880aab35c4e2473db upstream.
Fix a commit 311ee9c151ad ("rtc: cmos: allow using ACPI for RTC alarm
instead of HPET") `rtc-cmos' regression causing a link error:
drivers/rtc/rtc-cmos.o: In function `cmos\_platform\_probe':
rtc-cmos.c:(.init.text+0x33c): undefined reference to `hpet\_rtc\_interrupt'
rtc-cmos.c:(.init.text+0x3f4): undefined reference to `hpet\_rtc\_interrupt'
with non-ACPI platforms using this driver. The cause is the change of
the condition guarding the use of `hpet\_rtc\_interrupt'.
Previously it was a call to `is\_hpet\_enabled'. That function is static
inline and has a hardcoded 0 result for non-ACPI platforms, which imply
!HPET\_EMULATE\_RTC. Consequently the compiler optimized the whole block
away including the reference to `hpet\_rtc\_interrupt', which never made
it to the link stage.
Now the guarding condition is a call to `use\_hpet\_alarm', which is not
static inline and therefore the compiler may not be able to prove that
it actually always returns 0 for non-ACPI platforms. Consequently the
build breaks with an unsatisfied reference, because `hpet\_rtc\_interrupt'
is nowhere defined at link time.
Fix the problem by marking `use\_hpet\_alarm' inline. As the `inline'
keyword serves as an optimization hint rather than a requirement the
compiler is still free to choose whether inlining will be beneficial or
not for ACPI platforms.

MIPS: memset: Fix CPU\_DADDI\_WORKAROUNDS `small\_fixup' regression
commit 2f7619ae90bf78cf576b5e72087aab0435266fdb upstream.
Fix a commit 8a8158c85e1e ("MIPS: memset.S: EVA & fault support for

arch/mips/lib/memset.S: Assembler messages:
arch/mips/lib/memset.S:243: Warning: Macro instruction expanded into multiple instructions in a branch delay slot
triggering with the CPU\_DADDI\_WORKAROUNDS option set and this code:
PTR\_SUBU a2, t1, a0
jr ra
PTR\_ADDIU a2, 1
This is because with that option in place the DADDIU instruction, which
the PTR\_ADDIU CPP macro expands to, becomes a GAS macro, which in turn
expands to an LI/DADDU (or actually ADDIU/DADDU) sequence:
13c: 01a4302f dsubu a2,t1,a0

144: 24010001 li at,1
148: 00c1302d daddu a2,a2,at
...
Correct this by switching off the `noreorder' assembly mode and letting
GAS schedule this jump's delay slot, as there is nothing special about
it that would require manual scheduling. With this change in place
correct code is produced:
13c: 01a4302f dsubu a2,t1,a0

powerpc/tm: Fix HFSCR bit for no suspend case

Currently on P9N DD2.1 we end up taking infinite TM facility
unavailable exceptions on the first TM usage by userspace.
In the special case of TM no suspend (P9N DD2.1), Linux is told TM is
off via CPU dt-ftrs but told to (partially) use it via
OPAL\_REINIT\_CPUS\_TM\_SUSPEND\_DISABLED. So HFSCR[TM] will be off from
dt-ftrs but we need to turn it on for the no suspend case.
This patch fixes this by enabling HFSCR TM in this case.

fsnotify: Fix busy inodes during unmount
commit 721fb6fbfd2132164c2e8777cc837f9b2c1794dc upstream.
Detaching of mark connector from fsnotify\_put\_mark() can race with
unmounting of the filesystem like:
CPU1 CPU2
fsnotify\_put\_mark()
spin\_lock(&conn->lock);
...
inode = fsnotify\_detach\_connector\_from\_object(conn)
spin\_unlock(&conn->lock);
generic\_shutdown\_super()
fsnotify\_unmount\_inodes()
sees connector detached for inode
-> nothing to do
evict\_inode()
barfs on pending inode reference
iput(inode);
Resulting in "Busy inodes after unmount" message and possible kernel
oops. Make fsnotify\_unmount\_inodes() properly wait for outstanding inode
references from detached connectors.
Note that the accounting of outstanding inode references in the
superblock can cause some cacheline contention on the counter. OTOH it
happens only during deletion of the last notification mark from an inode
(or during unlinking of watched inode) and that is not too bad. I have
measured time to create & delete inotify watch 100000 times from 64
processes in parallel (each process having its own inotify group and its
own file on a shared superblock) on a 64 CPU machine. Average and
standard deviation of 15 runs look like:
Avg Stddev
Vanilla 9.817400 0.276165
Fixed 9.710467 0.228294
So there's no statistically significant difference.

dm zoned: fix various dmz\_get\_mblock() issues
commit 3d4e738311327bc4ba1d55fbe2f1da3de4a475f9 upstream.
dmz\_fetch\_mblock() called from dmz\_get\_mblock() has a race since the
allocation of the new metadata block descriptor and its insertion in
the cache rbtree with the READING state is not atomic. Two different
contexts requesting the same block may end up each adding two different
descriptors of the same block to the cache.
Another problem for this function is that the BIO for processing the
block read is allocated after the metadata block descriptor is inserted
in the cache rbtree. If the BIO allocation fails, the metadata block
descriptor is freed without first being removed from the rbtree.
Fix the first problem by checking again if the requested block is not in
the cache right before inserting the newly allocated descriptor,
atomically under the mblk\_lock spinlock. The second problem is fixed by
simply allocating the BIO before inserting the new block in the cache.
Finally, since dmz\_fetch\_mblock() also increments a block reference
counter, rename the function to dmz\_get\_mblock\_slow(). To be symmetric
and clear, also rename dmz\_lookup\_mblock() to dmz\_get\_mblock\_fast() and
increment the block reference counter directly in that function rather
than in dmz\_get\_mblock().

dm zoned: fix metadata block ref counting
commit 33c2865f8d011a2ca9f67124ddab9dc89382e9f1 upstream.
Since the ref field of struct dmz\_mblock is always used with the
spinlock of struct dmz\_metadata locked, there is no need to use an
atomic\_t type. Change the type of the ref field to an unsigne
integer.

dm ioctl: harden copy\_params()'s copy\_from\_user() from malicious users
commit 800a7340ab7dd667edf95e74d8e4f23a17e87076 upstream.
In copy\_params(), the struct 'dm\_ioctl' is first copied from the user
space buffer 'user' to 'param\_kernel' and the field 'data\_size' is
checked against 'minimum\_data\_size' (size of 'struct dm\_ioctl' payload
up to its 'data' member). If the check fails, an error code EINVAL will be
returned. Otherwise, param\_kernel->data\_size is used to do a second copy,
which copies from the same user-space buffer to 'dmi'. After the second
copy, only 'dmi->data\_size' is checked against 'param\_kernel->data\_size'.
Given that the buffer 'user' resides in the user space, a malicious
user-space process can race to change the content in the buffer between
the two copies. This way, the attacker can inject inconsistent data
into 'dmi' (versus previously validated 'param\_kernel').
Fix redundant copying of 'minimum\_data\_size' from user-space buffer by
using the first copy stored in 'param\_kernel'. Also remove the
'data\_size' check after the second copy because it is now unnecessary.

NFSv4.1: Fix the r/wsize checking
commit 943cff67b842839f4f35364ba2db5c2d3f025d94 upstream.
The intention of nfs4\_session\_set\_rwsize() was to cap the r/wsize to the
buffer sizes negotiated by the CREATE\_SESSION. The initial code had a
bug whereby we would not check the values negotiated by nfs\_probe\_fsinfo()
(the assumption being that CREATE\_SESSION will always negotiate buffer values
that are sane w.r.t. the server's preferred r/wsizes) but would only check
values set by the user in the 'mount' command.
The code was changed in 4.11 to \_always\_ set the r/wsize, meaning that we
now never use the server preferred r/wsizes. This is the regression that
this patch fixes.
Also rename the function to nfs4\_session\_limit\_rwsize() in order to avoid
future confusion.

entire tree from a given start node and thus can return an unrelated

This also addresses a potential use-after-free (e.g. after probe

genirq: Fix race on spurious interrupt detection
commit 746a923b863a1065ef77324e1e43f19b1a3eab5c upstream.
Commit 1e77d0a1ed74 ("genirq: Sanitize spurious interrupt detection of
threaded irqs") made detection of spurious interrupts work for threaded
handlers by:
a) incrementing a counter every time the thread returns IRQ\_HANDLED, and
b) checking whether that counter has increased every time the thread is
woken.
However for oneshot interrupts, the commit unmasks the interrupt before
incrementing the counter. If another interrupt occurs right after
unmasking but before the counter is incremented, that interrupt is
incorrectly considered spurious:
time
| irq\_thread()
| irq\_thread\_fn()
| action->thread\_fn()
| irq\_finalize\_oneshot()
| unmask\_threaded\_irq() /\* interrupt is unmasked \*/
|
| /\* interrupt fires, incorrectly deemed spurious \*/
|
| atomic\_inc(&desc->threads\_handled); /\* counter is incremented \*/
v
This is observed with a hi3110 CAN controller receiving data at high volume
(from a separate machine sending with "cangen -g 0 -i -x"): The controller
signals a huge number of interrupts (hundreds of millions per day) and
every second there are about a dozen which are deemed spurious.
In theory with high CPU load and the presence of higher priority tasks, the
number of incorrectly detected spurious interrupts might increase beyond
the 99,900 threshold and cause disablement of the interrupt.
In practice it just increments the spurious interrupt count. But that can
cause people to waste time investigating it over and over.
Fix it by moving the accounting before the invocation of
irq\_finalize\_oneshot().

smb3: on kerberos mount if server doesn't specify auth type use krb5
commit 926674de6705f0f1dbf29a62fd758d0977f535d6 upstream.
Some servers (e.g. Azure) do not include a spnego blob in the SMB3
negotiate protocol response, so on kerberos mounts ("sec=krb5")
we can fail, as we expected the server to list its supported
auth types (OIDs in the spnego blob in the negprot response).
Change this so that on krb5 mounts we default to trying krb5 if the
server doesn't list its supported protocol mechanisms.

iio: adc: at91: fix wrong channel number in triggered buffer mode
commit aea835f2dc8a682942b859179c49ad1841a6c8b9 upstream.
When channels are registered, the hardware channel number is not the
actual iio channel number.
This is because the driver is probed with a certain number of accessible
channels. Some pins are routed and some not, depending on the description of
the board in the DT.
Because of that, channels 0,1,2,3 can correspond to hardware channels
2,3,4,5 for example.
In the buffered triggered case, we need to do the translation accordingly.
Fixed the channel number to stop reading the wrong channel.

commit bc1b45326223e7e890053cf6266357adfa61942d upstream.
When doing simple conversions, the driver did not acknowledge the DRDY irq.
If this irq status is not acked, it will be left pending, and as soon as a
trigger is enabled, the irq handler will be called, it doesn't know why
this status has occurred because no channel is pending, and then it will go
int a irq loop and board will hang.
To avoid this situation, read the LCDR after a raw conversion is done.

iio: ad5064: Fix regulator handling
commit 8911a43bc198877fad9f4b0246a866b26bb547ab upstream.
The correct way to handle errors returned by regualtor\_get() and friends is
to propagate the error since that means that an regulator was specified,
but something went wrong when requesting it.
For handling optional regulators, e.g. when the device has an internal
vref, regulator\_get\_optional() should be used to avoid getting the dummy
regulator that the regulator core otherwise provides.

kbuild: fix kernel/bounds.c 'W=1' warning
commit 6a32c2469c3fbfee8f25bcd20af647326650a6cf upstream.
Building any configuration with 'make W=1' produces a warning:
kernel/bounds.c:16:6: warning: no previous prototype for 'foo' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
When also passing -Werror, this prevents us from building any other files.
Nobody ever calls the function, but we can't make it 'static' either
since we want the compiler output.
Calling it 'main' instead however avoids the warning, because gcc
does not insist on having a declaration for main.

KVM: arm64: Fix caching of host MDCR\_EL2 value
commit da5a3ce66b8bb51b0ea8a89f42aac153903f90fb upstream.
At boot time, KVM stashes the host MDCR\_EL2 value, but only does this
when the kernel is not running in hyp mode (i.e. is non-VHE). In these
cases, the stashed value of MDCR\_EL2.HPMN happens to be zero, which can
lead to CONSTRAINED UNPREDICTABLE behaviour.
Since we use this value to derive the MDCR\_EL2 value when switching
to/from a guest, after a guest have been run, the performance counters
do not behave as expected. This has been observed to result in accesses
via PMXEVTYPER\_EL0 and PMXEVCNTR\_EL0 not affecting the relevant
counters, resulting in events not being counted. In these cases, only
the fixed-purpose cycle counter appears to work as expected.
Fix this by always stashing the host MDCR\_EL2 value, regardless of VHE.

KVM: arm/arm64: Ensure only THP is candidate for adjustment
commit fd2ef358282c849c193aa36dadbf4f07f7dcd29b upstream.
PageTransCompoundMap() returns true for hugetlbfs and THP
hugepages. This behaviour incorrectly leads to stage 2 faults for
unsupported hugepage sizes (e.g., 64K hugepage with 4K pages) to be
treated as THP faults.
Tighten the check to filter out hugetlbfs pages. This also leads to
consistently mapping all unsupported hugepage sizes as PTE level
entries at stage 2.

mm/hmm: fix race between hmm\_mirror\_unregister() and mmu\_notifier callback
commit 86a2d59841ab0b147ffc1b7b3041af87927cf312 upstream.
In hmm\_mirror\_unregister(), mm->hmm is set to NULL and then
mmu\_notifier\_unregister\_no\_release() is called. That creates a small
window where mmu\_notifier can call mmu\_notifier\_ops with mm->hmm equal to
NULL. Fix this by first unregistering mmu notifier callbacks and then
setting mm->hmm to NULL.
Similarly in hmm\_register(), set mm->hmm before registering mmu\_notifier
callbacks so callback functions always see mm->hmm set.

mm/rmap: map\_pte() was not handling private ZONE\_DEVICE page properly
commit aab8d0520e6e7c2a61f71195e6ce7007a4843afb upstream.
Private ZONE\_DEVICE pages use a special pte entry and thus are not
present. Properly handle this case in map\_pte(), it is already handled in
check\_pte(), the map\_pte() part was lost in some rebase most probably.
Without this patch the slow migration path can not migrate back to any
private ZONE\_DEVICE memory to regular memory. This was found after stress
testing migration back to system memory. This ultimatly can lead to the
CPU constantly page fault looping on the special swap entry.

hugetlbfs: dirty pages as they are added to pagecache
commit 22146c3ce98962436e401f7b7016a6f664c9ffb5 upstream.
Some test systems were experiencing negative huge page reserve counts and
incorrect file block counts. This was traced to /proc/sys/vm/drop\_caches
removing clean pages from hugetlbfs file pagecaches. When non-hugetlbfs
explicit code removes the pages, the appropriate accounting is not
performed.
This can be recreated as follows:
fallocate -l 2M /dev/hugepages/foo
echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop\_caches
fallocate -l 2M /dev/hugepages/foo
grep -i huge /proc/meminfo
AnonHugePages: 0 kB
ShmemHugePages: 0 kB
HugePages\_Total: 2048
HugePages\_Free: 2047
HugePages\_Rsvd: 18446744073709551615
HugePages\_Surp: 0

ls -lsh /dev/hugepages/foo
4.0M -rw-r--r--. 1 root root 2.0M Oct 17 20:05 /dev/hugepages/foo
To address this issue, dirty pages as they are added to pagecache. This
can easily be reproduced with fallocate as shown above. Read faulted
pages will eventually end up being marked dirty. But there is a window
where they are clean and could be impacted by code such as drop\_caches.
So, just dirty them all as they are added to the pagecache.

false.
To fix, reset the check\_shmem\_swap flag to false. There's also related
bug which sets mss->swap to shmem\_swapped, which in the context of
smaps\_rollup overwrites any value accumulated from previous vma's. Fix
that as well.

which makes the 4.19 series ending with commit 258f669e7e88 ("mm:

But the mss was reused for rollup since 493b0e9d945f ("mm: add

While fixing an out of bounds array access in known\_siginfo\_layout

exists in siginfo\_layout and affects copy\_siginfo\_from\_user32.
The straight forward fix that makes guards against making this mistake
in the future and should keep the code size small is to just take an
unsigned signal number instead of a signed signal number, as I did to
fix known\_siginfo\_layout.

signal/GenWQE: Fix sending of SIGKILL
commit 0ab93e9c99f8208c0a1a7b7170c827936268c996 upstream.
The genweq\_add\_file and genwqe\_del\_file by caching current without
using reference counting embed the assumption that a file descriptor
will never be passed from one process to another. It even embeds the
assumption that the the thread that opened the file will be in
existence when the process terminates. Neither of which are
guaranteed to be true.
Therefore replace caching the task\_struct of the opener with
pid of the openers thread group id. All the knowledge of the
opener is used for is as the target of SIGKILL and a SIGKILL
will kill the entire process group.
Rename genwqe\_force\_sig to genwqe\_terminate, remove it's unncessary
signal argument, update it's ownly caller, and use kill\_pid
instead of force\_sig.
The work force\_sig does in changing signal handling state is not
relevant to SIGKILL sent as SEND\_SIG\_PRIV. The exact same processess
will be killed just with less work, and less confusion. The work done
by force\_sig is really only needed for handling syncrhonous
exceptions.
It will still be possible to cause genwqe\_device\_remove to wait
8 seconds by passing a file descriptor to another process but
the possible user after free is fixed.

PCI: vmd: White list for fast interrupt handlers
commit a7f58b9ecfd3c0f63703ec10f4a592cc38dbd1b8 upstream.
Devices with slow interrupt handlers are significantly harming
performance when their interrupt vector is shared with a fast device.
Create a class code white list for devices with known fast interrupt
handlers and let all other devices share a single vector so that they
don't interfere with performance.
At the moment, only the NVM Express class code is on the list, but more
may be added if VMD users desire to use other low-latency devices in
these domains.

PCI: Add Device IDs for Intel GPU "spurious interrupt" quirk
commit d0c9606b31a21028fb5b753c8ad79626292accfd upstream.
Add Device IDs to the Intel GPU "spurious interrupt" quirk table.
For these devices, unplugging the VGA cable and plugging it in again causes
spurious interrupts from the IGD. Linux eventually disables the interrupt,
but of course that disables any other devices sharing the interrupt.
The theory is that this is a VGA BIOS defect: it should have disabled the
IGD interrupt but failed to do so.
See f67fd55fa96f ("PCI: Add quirk for still enabled interrupts on Intel
Sandy Bridge GPUs") and 7c82126a94e6 ("PCI: Add new ID for Intel GPU
"spurious interrupt" quirk") for some history.
[bhelgaas: See link below for discussion about how to fix this more
generically instead of adding device IDs for every new Intel GPU. I hope
this is the last patch to add device IDs.]

PCI/ASPM: Fix link\_state teardown on device removal
commit aeae4f3e5c38d47bdaef50446dc0ec857307df68 upstream.
Upon removal of the last device on a bus, the link\_state of the bridge
leading to that bus is sought to be torn down by having pci\_stop\_dev()
call pcie\_aspm\_exit\_link\_state().
When ASPM was originally introduced by commit 7d715a6c1ae5 ("PCI: add
PCI Express ASPM support"), it determined whether the device being
removed is the last one by calling list\_empty() on the bridge's
subordinate devices list. That didn't work because the device is only
removed from the list slightly later in pci\_destroy\_dev().
Commit 3419c75e15f8 ("PCI: properly clean up ASPM link state on device
remove") attempted to fix it by calling list\_is\_last(), but that's not
correct either because it checks whether the device is at the \*end\* of
the list, not whether it's the last one \*left\* in the list. If the user
removes the device which happens to be at the end of the list via sysfs
but other devices are preceding the device in the list, the link\_state
is torn down prematurely.
The real fix is to move the invocation of pcie\_aspm\_exit\_link\_state() to
pci\_destroy\_dev() and reinstate the call to list\_empty(). Remove a
duplicate check for dev->bus->self because pcie\_aspm\_exit\_link\_state()
already contains an identical check.

uncorrected error is being logged, the h/w sets this field to 0. Which

HID: hiddev: fix potential Spectre v1
commit f11274396a538b31bc010f782e05c2ce3f804c13 upstream.
uref->usage\_index can be indirectly controlled by userspace, hence leading
to a potential exploitation of the Spectre variant 1 vulnerability.
This field is used as an array index by the hiddev\_ioctl\_usage() function,
when 'cmd' is either HIDIOCGCOLLECTIONINDEX, HIDIOCGUSAGES or
HIDIOCSUSAGES.
For cmd == HIDIOCGCOLLECTIONINDEX case, uref->usage\_index is compared to
field->maxusage and then used as an index to dereference field->usage
array. The same thing happens to the cmd == HIDIOC{G,S}USAGES cases, where
uref->usage\_index is checked against an array maximum value and then it is
used as an index in an array.
This is a summary of the HIDIOCGCOLLECTIONINDEX case, which matches the
traditional Spectre V1 first load:
copy\_from\_user(uref, user\_arg, sizeof(\*uref))
if (uref->usage\_index >= field->maxusage)
goto inval;
i = field->usage[uref->usage\_index].collection\_index;
return i;
This patch fixes this by sanitizing field uref->usage\_index before using it
to index field->usage (HIDIOCGCOLLECTIONINDEX) or field->value in
HIDIOC{G,S}USAGES arrays, thus, avoiding speculation in the first load.

HID: wacom: Work around HID descriptor bug in DTK-2451 and DTH-2452
commit 11db8173dbab7a94cf5ba5225fcedbfc0f3b7e54 upstream.
The DTK-2451 and DTH-2452 have a buggy HID descriptor which incorrectly
contains a Cintiq-like report, complete with pen tilt, rotation, twist, serial
number, etc. The hardware doesn't actually support this data but our driver
duitifully sets up the device as though it does. To ensure userspace has a
correct view of devices without updated firmware, we clean up this incorrect
data in wacom\_setup\_device\_quirks.
We're also careful to clear the WACOM\_QUIRK\_TOOLSERIAL flag since its presence
causes the driver to wait for serial number information (via
wacom\_wac\_pen\_serial\_enforce) that never comes, resulting in
the pen being non-responsive.

selinux: fix mounting of cgroup2 under older policies
commit 7bb185edb0306bb90029a5fa6b9cff900ffdbf4b upstream.
commit 901ef845fa2469c ("selinux: allow per-file labeling for cgroupfs")
broke mounting of cgroup2 under older SELinux policies which lacked
a genfscon rule for cgroup2. This prevents mounting of cgroup2 even
when SELinux is permissive.
Change the handling when there is no genfscon rule in policy to
just mark the inode unlabeled and not return an error to the caller.
This permits mounting and access if allowed by policy, e.g. to
unconfined domains.
I also considered changing the behavior of security\_genfs\_sid() to
never return -ENOENT, but the current behavior is relied upon by
other callers to perform caller-specific handling.

ext4: fix setattr project check in fssetxattr ioctl
commit dc7ac6c4cae3b58724c2f1e21a7c05ce19ecd5a8 upstream.
Currently, project quota could be changed by fssetxattr
ioctl, and existed permission check inode\_owner\_or\_capable()
is obviously not enough, just think that common users could
change project id of file, that could make users to
break project quota easily.
This patch try to follow same regular of xfs project
quota:
"Project Quota ID state is only allowed to change from
within the init namespace. Enforce that restriction only
if we are trying to change the quota ID state.
Everything else is allowed in user namespaces."
Besides that, check and set project id'state should
be an atomic operation, protect whole operation with
inode lock, ext4\_ioctl\_setproject() is only used for
ioctl EXT4\_IOC\_FSSETXATTR, we have held mnt\_want\_write\_file()
before ext4\_ioctl\_setflags(), and ext4\_ioctl\_setproject()
is called after ext4\_ioctl\_setflags(), we could share
codes, so remove it inside ext4\_ioctl\_setproject().

IB/rxe: Revise the ib\_wr\_opcode enum
commit 9a59739bd01f77db6fbe2955a4fce165f0f43568 upstream.
This enum has become part of the uABI, as both RXE and the
ib\_uverbs\_post\_send() command expect userspace to supply values from this
enum. So it should be properly placed in include/uapi/rdma.
In userspace this enum is called 'enum ibv\_wr\_opcode' as part of
libibverbs.h. That enum defines different values for IB\_WR\_LOCAL\_INV,
IB\_WR\_SEND\_WITH\_INV, and IB\_WR\_LSO. These were introduced (incorrectly, it
turns out) into libiberbs in 2015.
The kernel has changed its mind on the numbering for several of the IB\_WC
values over the years, but has remained stable on IB\_WR\_LOCAL\_INV and
below.
Based on this we can conclude that there is no real user space user of the
values beyond IB\_WR\_ATOMIC\_FETCH\_AND\_ADD, as they have never worked via
rdma-core. This is confirmed by inspection, only rxe uses the kernel enum
and implements the latter operations. rxe has clearly never worked with
these attributes from userspace. Other drivers that support these opcodes
implement the functionality without calling out to the kernel.
To make IB\_WR\_SEND\_WITH\_INV and related work for RXE in userspace we
choose to renumber the IB\_WR enum in the kernel to match the uABI that
userspace has bee using since before Soft RoCE was merged. This is an
overall simpler configuration for the whole software stack, and obviously
can't break anything existing.

libnvdimm: Hold reference on parent while scheduling async init
commit b6eae0f61db27748606cc00dafcfd1e2c032f0a5 upstream.
Unlike asynchronous initialization in the core we have not yet associated
the device with the parent, and as such the device doesn't hold a reference
to the parent.
In order to resolve that we should be holding a reference on the parent
until the asynchronous initialization has completed.

net/ipv4: defensive cipso option parsing
commit 076ed3da0c9b2f88d9157dbe7044a45641ae369e upstream.
commit 40413955ee26 ("Cipso: cipso\_v4\_optptr enter infinite loop") fixed
a possible infinite loop in the IP option parsing of CIPSO. The fix
assumes that ip\_options\_compile filtered out all zero length options and
that no other one-byte options beside IPOPT\_END and IPOPT\_NOOP exist.
While this assumption currently holds true, add explicit checks for zero
length and invalid length options to be safe for the future. Even though
ip\_options\_compile should have validated the options, the introduction of
new one-byte options can still confuse this code without the additional
checks.

xen: make xen\_qlock\_wait() nestable
commit a856531951dc8094359dfdac21d59cee5969c18e upstream.
xen\_qlock\_wait() isn't safe for nested calls due to interrupts. A call
of xen\_qlock\_kick() might be ignored in case a deeper nesting level
was active right before the call of xen\_poll\_irq():
CPU 1: CPU 2:
spin\_lock(lock1)
spin\_lock(lock1)
-> xen\_qlock\_wait()
-> xen\_clear\_irq\_pending()
Interrupt happens
spin\_unlock(lock1)
-> xen\_qlock\_kick(CPU 2)
spin\_lock\_irqsave(lock2)
spin\_lock\_irqsave(lock2)
-> xen\_qlock\_wait()
-> xen\_clear\_irq\_pending()
clears kick for lock1
-> xen\_poll\_irq()
spin\_unlock\_irq\_restore(lock2)
-> xen\_qlock\_kick(CPU 2)
wakes up
spin\_unlock\_irq\_restore(lock2)
IRET
resumes in xen\_qlock\_wait()
-> xen\_poll\_irq()
never wakes up
The solution is to disable interrupts in xen\_qlock\_wait() and not to
poll for the irq in case xen\_qlock\_wait() is called in nmi context.

xen: fix race in xen\_qlock\_wait()
commit 2ac2a7d4d9ff4e01e36f9c3d116582f6f655ab47 upstream.
In the following situation a vcpu waiting for a lock might not be
woken up from xen\_poll\_irq():
CPU 1: CPU 2: CPU 3:
takes a spinlock
tries to get lock
-> xen\_qlock\_wait()
frees the lock
-> xen\_qlock\_kick(cpu2)
-> xen\_clear\_irq\_pending()
takes lock again
tries to get lock
-> \*lock = \_Q\_SLOW\_VAL
-> \*lock == \_Q\_SLOW\_VAL ?
-> xen\_poll\_irq()
frees the lock
-> xen\_qlock\_kick(cpu3)
And cpu 2 will sleep forever.
This can be avoided easily by modifying xen\_qlock\_wait() to call
xen\_poll\_irq() only if the related irq was not pending and to call
xen\_clear\_irq\_pending() only if it was pending.

xen/blkfront: avoid NULL blkfront\_info dereference on device removal
commit f92898e7f32e3533bfd95be174044bc349d416ca upstream.
If a block device is hot-added when we are out of grants,
gnttab\_grant\_foreign\_access fails with -ENOSPC (log message "28
granting access to ring page") in this code path:
talk\_to\_blkback ->
setup\_blkring ->
xenbus\_grant\_ring ->
gnttab\_grant\_foreign\_access
and the failing path in talk\_to\_blkback sets the driver\_data to NULL:
destroy\_blkring:
blkif\_free(info, 0);
mutex\_lock(&blkfront\_mutex);
free\_info(info);
mutex\_unlock(&blkfront\_mutex);
dev\_set\_drvdata(&dev->dev, NULL);
This results in a NULL pointer BUG when blkfront\_remove and blkif\_free
try to access the failing device's NULL struct blkfront\_info.

tpm: Restore functionality to xen vtpm driver.
commit e487a0f52301293152a6f8c4e217f2a11dd808e3 upstream.
Functionality of the xen-tpmfront driver was lost secondary to
the introduction of xenbus multi-page support in commit ccc9d90a9a8b
("xenbus\_client: Extend interface to support multi-page ring").
In this commit pointer to location of where the shared page address
is stored was being passed to the xenbus\_grant\_ring() function rather
then the address of the shared page itself. This resulted in a situation
where the driver would attach to the vtpm-stubdom but any attempt
to send a command to the stub domain would timeout.
A diagnostic finding for this regression is the following error
message being generated when the xen-tpmfront driver probes for a
device:
<3>vtpm vtpm-0: tpm\_transmit: tpm\_send: error -62
<3>vtpm vtpm-0: A TPM error (-62) occurred attempting to determine
the timeouts
This fix is relevant to all kernels from 4.1 forward which is the
release in which multi-page xenbus support was introduced.
Daniel De Graaf formulated the fix by code inspection after the
regression point was located.

xen-swiotlb: use actually allocated size on check physical continuous
commit 7250f422da0480d8512b756640f131b9b893ccda upstream.
xen\_swiotlb\_{alloc,free}\_coherent() allocate/free memory based on the
order of the pages and not size argument (bytes). This is inconsistent with
range\_straddles\_page\_boundary and memset which use the 'size' value,
which may lead to not exchanging memory with Xen (range\_straddles\_page\_boundary()
returned true). And then the call to xen\_swiotlb\_free\_coherent() would
actually try to exchange the memory with Xen, leading to the kernel
hitting an BUG (as the hypercall returned an error).
This patch fixes it by making the 'size' variable be of the same size
as the amount of memory allocated.

arm: dts: exynos: Add missing cooling device properties for CPUs
commit 672f33198bee21ee91e6af2cb8f67cfc8bc97ec1 upstream.
The cooling device properties, like "#cooling-cells" and

of a cluster or none. If these are present only for a subset of CPUs of
a cluster then things will start falling apart as soon as the CPUs are
brought online in a different order. For example, this will happen
because the operating system looks for such properties in the CPU node
it is trying to bring up, so that it can register a cooling device.
Add such missing properties.
Fix other missing properties (clocks, OPP, clock latency) as well to
make it all work.

f2fs: fix to recover cold bit of inode block during POR
commit ef2a007134b4eaa39264c885999f296577bc87d2 upstream.
Testcase to reproduce this bug:
1. mkfs.f2fs /dev/sdd
2. mount -t f2fs /dev/sdd /mnt/f2fs
3. touch /mnt/f2fs/file
4. sync
5. chattr +A /mnt/f2fs/file
6. xfs\_io -f /mnt/f2fs/file -c "fsync"
7. godown /mnt/f2fs
8. umount /mnt/f2fs
9. mount -t f2fs /dev/sdd /mnt/f2fs
10. chattr -A /mnt/f2fs/file
11. xfs\_io -f /mnt/f2fs/file -c "fsync"
12. umount /mnt/f2fs
13. mount -t f2fs /dev/sdd /mnt/f2fs
14. lsattr /mnt/f2fs/file
-----------------N- /mnt/f2fs/file
But actually, we expect the corrct result is:
-------A---------N- /mnt/f2fs/file
The reason is in step 9) we missed to recover cold bit flag in inode
block, so later, in fsync, we will skip write inode block due to below
condition check, result in lossing data in another SPOR.
f2fs\_fsync\_node\_pages()
if (!IS\_DNODE(page) || !is\_cold\_node(page))
continue;
Note that, I guess that some non-dir inode has already lost cold bit
during POR, so in order to reenable recovery for those inode, let's
try to recover cold bit in f2fs\_iget() to save more fsynced data.

If we clear the cold data flag out of the writeback flow, we can miscount

heavy GC.

- move\_data\_page()

This improves the code-readability.

IB/rxe: fix for duplicate request processing and ack psns
[ Upstream commit b97db58557f4aa6d9903f8e1deea6b3d1ed0ba43 ]
Don't reset the resp opcode for a replayed read response.
The resp opcode could be in the middle of a write or send
sequence, when the duplicate read request was received.
An example sequence is as follows:
- Receive read request for 12KB PSN 20. Transmit read response
first, middle and last with PSNs 20,21,22.
- Receive write first PSN 23.
At this point the resp psn is 24 and resp opcode is write first.
- The sender notices that PSN 20 is dropped and retransmits.
Receive read request for 12KB PSN 20. Transmit read response
first, middle and last with PSNs 20,21,22. The resp opcode is
set to -1, the resp psn remains 24.
- Receive write first PSN 23. This is processed by duplicate\_request().
The resp opcode remains -1 and resp psn remains 24.
- Receive write middle PSN 24. check\_op\_seq() reports a missing
first error since the resp opcode is -1.
When sending an ack for a duplicate send or write request,
use the psn of the previous ack sent. Do not use the psn
of a read response for the ack.
An example sequence is as follows:
- Receive write PSN 30. Transmit ACK for PSN 30.
- Receive read request 4KB PSN 31. Transmit read response with
PSN 31. The resp psn is now 32.
- The sender notices that PSN 30 is dropped and retransmits.
Receive write PSN 30. duplicate\_request() sends an ACK with
PSN 31. That is incorrect since PSN 31 was a read request.

scsi: lpfc: Correct race with abort on completion path
[ Upstream commit ca7fb76e091f889cfda1287c07a9358f73832b39 ]
On io completion, the driver is taking an adapter wide lock and nulling the
scsi command back pointer. The nulling of the back pointer is to signify the
io was completed and the scsi\_done() routine was called. However, the routine
makes no check to see if the abort routine had done the same thing and
possibly nulled the pointer. Thus it may doubly-complete the io.
Make the following mods:
- Check to make sure forward progress (call scsi\_done()) only happens if the
command pointer was non-null.
- As the taking of the lock, which is adapter wide, is very costly on a system
under load, null the pointer using an xchg operation rather than under lock.

When running an mds diagnostic that passes frames with the switch, soft
lockups are detected. The driver is in a CQE processing loop and has
sufficient amount of traffic that it never exits the ring processing routine,
thus the "lockup".
Cap the number of elements in the work processing routine to 64 elements. This
ensures that the cpu will be given up and the handler reschedule to process
additional items.

set\_bit(IOAT\_CHAN\_DOWN, &ioat\_chan->state);
del\_timer\_sync(&ioat\_chan->timer);
spin\_unlock\_bh(&ioat\_chan->prep\_lock);
According to the synchronization rule for the del\_timer\_sync() function,
the caller must not hold locks which would prevent completion of the
timer's handler.
The timer structure has its own lock that manages its synchronization.
Setting the IOAT\_CHAN\_DOWN bit should prevent other CPUs from
trying to use that device anyway, there is probably no need to call
del\_timer\_sync() while holding the prep\_lock. So the del\_timer\_sync()
call is now moved outside of the prep\_lock critical section to prevent
the circular lock dependency.

xhci: Avoid USB autosuspend when resuming USB2 ports.
[ Upstream commit 330e2d61cdd58363eb5e66b2e72f76fe3c5492e0 ]
When USB bus host controller root hub resumes from autosuspend,
it immediately tries to enter auto-suspend, but there can be a
scenario when root hub is resuming its usb2 ports, in that particular
case USB host controller auto suspend fails since it is busy
to resuming its usb2 ports.
This makes multiple failed cycles of auto-suspend until all usb2
ports of host controller root hub do not resume.
This patch uses USB core framework usb\_hcd\_start\_port\_resume,
usb\_hcd\_end\_port\_resume API's in order to autoresume/autosuspend
root hub properly.

If we change the number of array's device after device is removed from array,

role instead of spare which we expected.
Please see the below link for details:

This is caused by that we prefer to use device's previous role which is
recorded by saved\_raid\_disk, but we should respect the new number of

Also fixed the helper function mext\_check\_coverage() so that if the

looping until the block number wraps all the away around. This takes
long enough that if there are multiple threads trying to do pound on
an the same inode doing non-sensical things, it can end up triggering

xprtrdma: Reset credit grant properly after a disconnect
[ Upstream commit ef739b2175dde9c05594f768cb78149f1ce2ac36 ]
On a fresh connection, an RPC/RDMA client is supposed to send only
one RPC Call until it gets a credit grant in the first RPC Reply
from the server [RFC 8166, Section 3.3.3].
There is a bug in the Linux client's credit accounting mechanism
introduced by commit e7ce710a8802 ("xprtrdma: Avoid deadlock when
credit window is reset"). On connect, it simply dumps all pending
RPC Calls onto the new connection.
Servers have been tolerant of this bad behavior. Currently no server
implementation ever changes its credit grant over reconnects, and
servers always repost enough Receives before connections are fully
established.
To correct this issue, ensure that the client resets both the credit
grant \_and\_ the congestion window when handling a reconnect.

PCI / ACPI: Enable wake automatically for power managed bridges
[ Upstream commit 6299cf9ec3985cac70bede8a855b5087b81a6640 ]
We enable power management automatically for bridges where
pci\_bridge\_d3\_possible() returns true. However, these bridges may have
ACPI methods such as \_DSW that need to be called before D3 entry. For
example in Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon 6th \_DSW method is used to prepare
D3cold for the PCIe root port hosting Thunderbolt chain. Because wake is
not enabled \_DSW method is never called and the port does not enter
D3cold properly consuming more power than necessary.
Users can work this around by writing "enabled" to "wakeup" sysfs file
under the device in question but that is not something an ordinary user
is expected to do.
Since we already automatically enable power management for PCIe ports
with ->bridge\_d3 set extend that to enable wake for them as well,
assuming the port has any ACPI wakeup related objects implemented in the
namespace (adev->wakeup.flags.valid is true). This ensures the necessary
ACPI methods get called at appropriate times and allows the root port in
Thinkpad X1 Carbon 6th to go into D3cold.

VMCI: Resource wildcard match fixed

When adding a VMCI resource, the check for an existing entry
would ignore that the new entry could be a wildcard. This could
result in multiple resource entries that would match a given
handle. One disastrous outcome of this is that the
refcounting used to ensure that delayed callbacks for VMCI
datagrams have run before the datagram is destroyed can be
wrong, since the refcount could be increased on the duplicate
entry. This in turn leads to a use after free bug. This issue
was discovered by Hangbin Liu using KASAN and syzkaller.

tpm: suppress transmit cmd error logs when TPM 1.2 is disabled/deactivated
[ Upstream commit 0d6d0d62d9505a9816716aa484ebd0b04c795063 ]
For TPM 1.2 chips the system setup utility allows to set the TPM device in
one of the following states:
\* Active: Security chip is functional
\* Inactive: Security chip is visible, but is not functional
\* Disabled: Security chip is hidden and is not functional
When choosing the "Inactive" state, the TPM 1.2 device is enumerated and
registered, but sending TPM commands fail with either TPM\_DEACTIVATED or
TPM\_DISABLED depending if the firmware deactivated or disabled the TPM.
Since these TPM 1.2 error codes don't have special treatment, inactivating
the TPM leads to a very noisy kernel log buffer that shows messages like
the following:
tpm\_tis 00:05: 1.2 TPM (device-id 0x0, rev-id 78)
tpm tpm0: A TPM error (6) occurred attempting to read a pcr value
tpm tpm0: TPM is disabled/deactivated (0x6)
tpm tpm0: A TPM error (6) occurred attempting get random
tpm tpm0: A TPM error (6) occurred attempting to read a pcr value
ima: No TPM chip found, activating TPM-bypass! (rc=6)
tpm tpm0: A TPM error (6) occurred attempting get random
tpm tpm0: A TPM error (6) occurred attempting get random
tpm tpm0: A TPM error (6) occurred attempting get random
tpm tpm0: A TPM error (6) occurred attempting get random
Let's just suppress error log messages for the TPM\_{DEACTIVATED,DISABLED}
return codes, since this is expected when the TPM 1.2 is set to Inactive.
In that case the kernel log is cleaner and less confusing for users, i.e:
tpm\_tis 00:05: 1.2 TPM (device-id 0x0, rev-id 78)
tpm tpm0: TPM is disabled/deactivated (0x6)
ima: No TPM chip found, activating TPM-bypass! (rc=6)

usb: typec: tcpm: Report back negotiated PPS voltage and current
[ Upstream commit 554fab6dbf20ee7298ed2d4e8398b85e6058abb7 ]
Currently when requesting a specific voltage or current through
the psy interface, for PPS, when reading back from that interface
the values will always be the same as previously given, if the
request was successful. However PPS only allows for 20mV voltage
steps and 50mA current steps, and the psy class expects microvolt
and micro amp requests, so inbetween values can be provided through
this interface. Really when reading back the true values negotiated
should be given, and not the ones originally asked for.
To report the actual values negotiated with the Source, the values
stored are now rounded down to the relevant step units prior to
building the PPS request, so that those values are later correctly
reported through the psy interface. In addition this improves the
adjustments made to meet the operating power requirements of the
platform, which previously could have been slightly out due to not
using valid PPS units of voltage and current.

PCI: cadence: Use AXI region 0 to signal interrupts from EP
[ Upstream commit 0652d4b6b56f73c81abbdbc7e26f772cb2dfe370 ]
The IRQ physical address is allocated from region 0, rather than
the highest region. Update the driver to reserve this region in
the bitmap and to use region 0 for all types of interrupt.
This corrects a problem which prevents the interrupt being
signalled correctly if using the first address in the AXI region,
since an offset of zero will always be mapped to region 0.

PCI: mediatek: Fix mtk\_pcie\_find\_port() endpoint/port matching logic
[ Upstream commit 074d6f32689ce05a084b6fa3db38445745bf11cc ]
The Mediatek's host controller has two slots, each with its own control
registers. The host driver needs to identify what slot is connected to
what port in order to access the device's configuration space.
Current code retrieving slot connected to a given endpoint device.
Assuming each slot is connected to one endpoint device as below:
host bridge
bus 0 --> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_|\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
| |
| |
slot 0 slot 1
bus 1 -->| bus 2 --> |
| |
EP 0 EP 1
During PCI enumeration, system software will scan all the PCI devices on
every bus starting from devfn 0. Using PCI\_SLOT(devfn) for matching an
endpoint to its slot is erroneous in that the devfn does not contain the
hierarchical bus numbering in it. In order to match an endpoint with its
slot (and related port), the PCI tree must be walked up to the root bus
(where the root ports are situated) and then the PCI\_SLOT(devfn)
matching logic can be correctly applied for matching.
This patch fixes the mtk\_pcie\_find\_port() slot matching logic by adding
appropriate PCI tree walking code to retrieve the slot/port a given
endpoint is connected to.

devm\_gpiod\_get\_index\_optional returns NULL if -ENOENT. Check its

scsi: megaraid\_sas: fix a missing-check bug
[ Upstream commit 47db7873136a9c57c45390a53b57019cf73c8259 ]
In megasas\_mgmt\_compat\_ioctl\_fw(), to handle the structure
compat\_megasas\_iocpacket 'cioc', a user-space structure megasas\_iocpacket
'ioc' is allocated before megasas\_mgmt\_ioctl\_fw() is invoked to handle
the packet. Since the two data structures have different fields, the data
is copied from 'cioc' to 'ioc' field by field. In the copy process,
'sense\_ptr' is prepared if the field 'sense\_len' is not null, because it
will be used in megasas\_mgmt\_ioctl\_fw(). To prepare 'sense\_ptr', the
user-space data 'ioc->sense\_off' and 'cioc->sense\_off' are copied and
saved to kernel-space variables 'local\_sense\_off' and 'user\_sense\_off'
respectively. Given that 'ioc->sense\_off' is also copied from
'cioc->sense\_off', 'local\_sense\_off' and 'user\_sense\_off' should have the
same value. However, 'cioc' is in the user space and a malicious user can
race to change the value of 'cioc->sense\_off' after it is copied to
'ioc->sense\_off' but before it is copied to 'user\_sense\_off'. By doing
so, the attacker can inject different values into 'local\_sense\_off' and
'user\_sense\_off'. This can cause undefined behavior in the following
execution, because the two variables are supposed to be same.
This patch enforces a check on the two kernel variables 'local\_sense\_off'
and 'user\_sense\_off' to make sure they are the same after the copy. In
case they are not, an error code EINVAL will be returned.

KVM: nVMX: Clear reserved bits of #DB exit qualification
[ Upstream commit cfb634fe3052aefc4e1360fa322018c9a0b49755 ]
According to volume 3 of the SDM, bits 63:15 and 12:4 of the exit
qualification field for debug exceptions are reserved (cleared to
0). However, the SDM is incorrect about bit 16 (corresponding to
DR6.RTM). This bit should be set if a debug exception (#DB) or a
breakpoint exception (#BP) occurred inside an RTM region while
advanced debugging of RTM transactional regions was enabled. Note that
this is the opposite of DR6.RTM, which "indicates (when clear) that a
debug exception (#DB) or breakpoint exception (#BP) occurred inside an
RTM region while advanced debugging of RTM transactional regions was
enabled."
There is still an issue with stale DR6 bits potentially being
misreported for the current debug exception. DR6 should not have been
modified before vectoring the #DB exception, and the "new DR6 bits"
should be available somewhere, but it was and they aren't.

UAPI: ndctl: Fix g++-unsupported initialisation in headers
[ Upstream commit 9607871f37dc3e717639694b8d0dc738f2a68efc ]
The following code in the linux/ndctl header file:
static inline const char \*nvdimm\_bus\_cmd\_name(unsigned cmd)
{
static const char \* const names[] = {
[ND\_CMD\_ARS\_CAP] = "ars\_cap",
[ND\_CMD\_ARS\_START] = "ars\_start",
[ND\_CMD\_ARS\_STATUS] = "ars\_status",
[ND\_CMD\_CLEAR\_ERROR] = "clear\_error",
[ND\_CMD\_CALL] = "cmd\_call",
};
if (cmd < ARRAY\_SIZE(names) && names[cmd])
return names[cmd];
return "unknown";
}
is broken in a number of ways:
(1) ARRAY\_SIZE() is not generally defined.
(2) g++ does not support "non-trivial" array initialisers fully yet.
(3) Every file that calls this function will acquire a copy of names[].
The same goes for nvdimm\_cmd\_name().
Fix all three by converting to a switch statement where each case returns a
string. That way if cmd is a constant, the compiler can trivially reduce it
and, if not, the compiler can use a shared lookup table if it thinks that is
more efficient.
A better way would be to remove these functions and their arrays from the
header entirely.

scsi: esp\_scsi: Track residual for PIO transfers
[ Upstream commit fd47d919d0c336e7c22862b51ee94927ffea227a ]
If a target disconnects during a PIO data transfer the command may fail
when the target reconnects:
scsi host1: DMA length is zero!
scsi host1: cur adr[04380000] len[00000000]
The scsi bus is then reset. This happens because the residual reached
zero before the transfer was completed.
The usual residual calculation relies on the Transfer Count registers.
That works for DMA transfers but not for PIO transfers. Fix the problem
by storing the PIO transfer residual and using that to correctly
calculate bytes\_sent.

Now, we have supported cgroup writeback, it depends on correctly IO
account of specified filesystem.
But in commit d1b3e72d5490 ("f2fs: submit bio of in-place-update pages"),
we split write paths from f2fs\_submit\_page\_mbio() to two:
- f2fs\_submit\_page\_bio() for IPU path
- f2fs\_submit\_page\_bio() for OPU path
But still we account write IO only in f2fs\_submit\_page\_mbio(), result in
incorrect IO account, fix it by adding missing IO account in IPU path.

net: stmmac: dwmac-sun8i: fix OF child-node lookup
[ Upstream commit ac63043d8cb5503c7e0fe110f947eacf2663804e ]
Use the new of\_get\_compatible\_child() helper to lookup the mdio-internal
child node instead of using of\_find\_compatible\_node(), which searches
the entire tree from a given start node and thus can return an unrelated
(i.e. non-child) node.
This also addresses a potential use-after-free (e.g. after probe
deferral) as the tree-wide helper drops a reference to its first
argument (i.e. the mdio-mux node). Fortunately, this was inadvertently
balanced by a failure to drop the mdio-mux reference after lookup.
While at it, also fix the related mdio-internal- and phy-node reference
leaks.

ath10k: schedule hardware restart if WMI command times out
[ Upstream commit a9911937e7d332761e8c4fcbc7ba0426bdc3956f ]
When running in AP mode, ath10k sometimes suffers from TX credit
starvation. The issue is hard to reproduce and shows up once in a
few days, but has been repeatedly seen with QCA9882 and a large
range of firmwares, including 10.2.4.70.67.
Once the module is in this state, TX credits are never replenished,
which results in "SWBA overrun" errors, as no beacons can be sent.
Even worse, WMI commands run in a timeout while holding the conf
mutex for three seconds each, making any further operations slow
and the whole system unresponsive.
The firmware/driver never recovers from that state automatically,
and triggering TX flush or warm restarts won't work over WMI. So
issue a hardware restart if a WMI command times out due to missing
TX credits. This implies a connectivity outage of about 1.4s in AP
mode, but brings back the interface and the whole system to a usable
state. WMI command timeouts have not been seen in absent of this
specific issue, so taking such drastic actions seems legitimate.

ixgbe: disallow IPsec Tx offload when in SR-IOV mode
[ Upstream commit 47b6f50077e68bcd544f657526dad4bfdce7e87d ]
There seems to be a problem in the x540's internal switch wherein if SR-IOV
mode is enabled and an offloaded IPsec packet is sent to a local VF,
the packet is silently dropped. This might never be a problem as it is
somewhat a corner case, but if someone happens to be using IPsec offload
from the PF to a VF that just happens to get migrated to the local box,
communication will mysteriously fail.
Not good.
A simple way to protect from this is to simply not allow any IPsec offloads
for outgoing packets when num\_vfs != 0. This doesn't help any offloads that
were created before SR-IOV was enabled, but we'll get to that later.

Sometimes we have empty banks within the GPIO block. This commit allows
proper handling of 0 width GPIO banks. We handle 0 width GPIO banks by
incrementing the bank and number of GPIOs, but not initializing them.
This will mean a call into the non-existent GPIOs will return an error.
Also remove "GPIO registered" dev print. This information is misleading
since the incremented banks and gpio\_base do not reflect the actual GPIOs
that get initialized. We leave this information out since it is already
printed with dev\_dbg.

net: hns3: Fix for vf vlan delete failed problem
[ Upstream commit 41dafea2af781d8e3ab8626d236b52e4172905a3 ]
There are only 128 entries in vf vlan table, if user has added
more than 128 vlan, fw will ignore it and disable the vf vlan
table. So when user deletes the vlan entry that has not been
set to vf vlan table, fw will return not found result and driver
treat that as error, which will cause vlan delete failed problem.
This patch fixes it by returning ok when fw returns not found
result.

NOTE: in case it's helpful to someone reading this, the way to tell
whether to do the -EINVAL or not is to look at the PCONFDUMP for a
given attribute. If the last element (has\_arg) is false then you need
to do the -EINVAL trick.
ALSO NOTE: it seems unlikely that the values returned when we try to
get PIN\_CONFIG\_BIAS\_PULL\_UP will actually be printed since "has\_arg"
is false for that one, but I guess it's still fine to return different
values so I kept doing that. It seems like another driver (ssbi-gpio)
uses a custom attribute (PM8XXX\_QCOM\_PULL\_UP\_STRENGTH) for something
similar so maybe a future change should do that here too.

When we don't have the iputils-debuginfo package installed, i.e. when we
don't have the DWARF information needed to resolve ping's samples, we
end up failing this 'perf test' entry:

62: probe libc's inet\_pton & backtrace it with ping : Ok
# rpm -e iputils-debuginfo

Fix it to accept "[unknown]" where the symbol + offset, when resolved,
is expected.
I think this will fail in the other arches as well, but since I can't
test now, I'm leaving s390x and ppc cases as-is.

bpf/verifier: fix verifier instability

Edward Cree says:
In check\_mem\_access(), for the PTR\_TO\_CTX case, after check\_ctx\_access()
has supplied a reg\_type, the other members of the register state are set
appropriately. Previously reg.range was set to 0, but as it is in a
union with reg.map\_ptr, which is larger, upper bytes of the latter were
left in place. This then caused the memcmp() in regsafe() to fail,
preventing some branches from being pruned (and occasionally causing the
same program to take a varying number of processed insns on repeated
verifier runs).

ACPI / LPSS: Add alternative ACPI HIDs for Cherry Trail DMA controllers
[ Upstream commit 240714061c58e6b1abfb3322398a7634151c06cb ]
Bay and Cherry Trail DSTDs represent a different set of devices depending
on which OS the device think it is booting. One set of decices for Windows
and another set of devices for Android which targets the Android-x86 Linux
kernel fork (which e.g. used to have its own display driver instead of
using the i915 driver).
Which set of devices we are actually going to get is out of our control,
this is controlled by the ACPI OSID variable, which gets either set through
an EFI setup option, or sometimes is autodetected. So we need to support
both.
This commit adds support for the 80862286 and 808622C0 ACPI HIDs which we
get for the first resp. second DMA controller on Cherry Trail devices when
OSID is set to Android.

spi: gpio: No MISO does not imply no RX
[ Upstream commit abf5feef3ff0cefade0c76be53b59e55fdd46093 ]
There is a logical problem in spi-gpio with host just
assigning a MOSI line and no MISO: this is interpreted
as the host cannot do RX and the host is flagged with
SPI\_MASTER\_NO\_RX.
This is wrong: since GPIO lines can switch direction,
in 3WIRE operation the host will simply reverse the
direction of the GPIO line and start reading from it,
there is even code for doing this in the driver, but
it went unnoticed because it was tested by using a
master with 4 wires but a device using just 3 wires.
Remove the offending flag.

block, bfq: correctly charge and reset entity service in all cases
[ Upstream commit cbeb869a3d1110450186b738199963c5e68c2a71 ]
BFQ schedules entities (which represent either per-process queues or
groups of queues) as a function of their timestamps. In particular, as
a function of their (virtual) finish times. The finish time of an
entity is computed as a function of the budget assigned to the entity,
assuming, tentatively, that the entity, once in service, will receive
an amount of service equal to its budget. Then, when the entity is
expired because it finishes to be served, this finish time is updated
as a function of the actual service received by the entity. This
allows the entity to be correctly charged with only the service
received, and then to be correctly re-scheduled.
Yet an entity may receive service also while not being the entity in
service (in the scheduling environment of its parent entity), for
several reasons. If the entity remains with no backlog while receiving
this 'unofficial' service, then it is expired. Also on such an
expiration, the finish time of the entity should be updated to account
for only the service actually received by the entity. Unfortunately,
such an update is not performed for an entity expiring without being
the entity in service.
In a similar vein, the service counter of the entity in service is
reset when the entity is expired, to be ready to be used for next
service cycle. This reset too should be performed also in case an
entity is expired because it remains empty after receiving service
while not being the entity in service. But in this case the reset is
not performed.
This commit performs the above update of the finish time and reset of
the service received, also for an entity expiring while not being the
entity in service.

x86: boot: Fix EFI stub alignment
[ Upstream commit 9c1442a9d039a1a3302fa93e9a11001c5f23b624 ]
We currently align the end of the compressed image to a multiple of
16. However, the PE-COFF header included in the EFI stub says that
the file alignment is 32 bytes, and when adding an EFI signature to
the file it must first be padded to this alignment.
sbsigntool commands warn about this:
warning: file-aligned section .text extends beyond end of file
warning: checksum areas are greater than image size. Invalid section table?
Worse, pesign -at least when creating a detached signature- uses the
hash of the unpadded file, resulting in an invalid signature if
padding is required.
Avoid both these problems by increasing alignment to 32 bytes when
CONFIG\_EFI\_STUB is enabled.

ice: update fw version check logic
[ Upstream commit 396fbf9cab5dc07f8f87773062a8d35f54b40a05 ]
We have MAX\_FW\_API\_VER\_BRANCH, MAX\_FW\_API\_VER\_MAJOR, and
MAX\_FW\_API\_VER\_MINOR that we use in ice\_controlq.h to test when a
firmware version is newer than expected. This is currently tested by
comparing each field separately. Thus, we compare the branch field
against the MAX\_FW\_API\_VER\_BRANCH, and so forth.
This means that currently, if we suppose that the max firmware version
is defined as 0.2.1, i.e.
Then firmware 0.1.3 will fail to load. This is because the minor version
3 is greater than the max minor version 1.
This is not intuitive, because of the notion that increasing the major
firmware version to 2 should mean any firmware version with a major
version is less than 2 should be considered older than 2...
In order to allow both 0.2.1 and 0.1.3 to load, you would have to define
the "max" firmware version as 0.2.3.. It is possible that such
a firmware version doesn't even exist yet!
Fix this by replacing the current logic with an updated check that
behaves as follows:
First, we check the major version. If it is greater than the expected
version, then we prevent driver load. Additionally, a warning message is
logged to indicate to the system administrator that they need to update
their driver. This is now the only case where the driver will refuse to
load.
Second, if the major version is less than the expected version, we log
an information message indicating the NVM should be updated.
Third, if the major version is exact, we'll then check the minor
version. If the minor version is more than two versions less than
expected, we log an information message indicating the NVM should be
updated. If it is more than two versions greater than the expected
version, we log an information message that the driver should be
updated.
To support this, the ice\_aq\_ver\_check function needs its signature
updated to pass the HW structure. Since we now pass this structure,
there is no need to pass the firmware API versions separately.

ice: fix changing of ring descriptor size (ethtool -G)
[ Upstream commit f934bb9b8b6136edd261b2dc2c9ad4dbc39ffc66 ]
rx\_mini\_pending was set to an incorrect value. This was causing EINVAL to
always be returned to 'ethtool -G'. The driver does not support mini or
jumbo rings so the respective settings should be zero.
Also, change the valid range of the number of descriptors in the rings to
make the code simpler and easier for users to understand (this removes the
valid settings of 8 and 16). Add a system log message indicating when the
number is rounded-up from what the user specifies with the 'ethtool -G'
command (i.e. when it is not a multiple of 32), and update the log message
when a user-provided value is out of range to also indicate the stride.

signal: Introduce COMPAT\_SIGMINSTKSZ for use in compat\_sys\_sigaltstack
[ Upstream commit 22839869f21ab3850fbbac9b425ccc4c0023926f ]
The sigaltstack(2) system call fails with -ENOMEM if the new alternative
signal stack is found to be smaller than SIGMINSTKSZ. On architectures
such as arm64, where the native value for SIGMINSTKSZ is larger than
the compat value, this can result in an unexpected error being reported
to a compat task. See, for example:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=904385
This patch fixes the problem by extending do\_sigaltstack to take the
minimum signal stack size as an additional parameter, allowing the
native and compat system call entry code to pass in their respective
values. COMPAT\_SIGMINSTKSZ is just defined as SIGMINSTKSZ if it has not
been defined by the architecture.

decrementing refcount which is already zero and hence generating
warnings.
Lets track if we were able to add static OPPs or not and then only
remove the table based on that. Some reshuffling of code is also done to

ACPI / processor: Fix the return value of acpi\_processor\_ids\_walk()
[ Upstream commit d0381bf4f80c571dde1244fe5b85dc35e8b3f546 ]
ACPI driver should make sure all the processor IDs in their ACPI Namespace
are unique. the driver performs a depth-first walk of the namespace tree
and calls the acpi\_processor\_ids\_walk() to check the duplicate IDs.
But, the acpi\_processor\_ids\_walk() mistakes the return value. If a
processor is checked, it returns true which causes the walk break
immediately, and other processors will never be checked.
Repace the value with AE\_OK which is the standard acpi\_status value.
And don't abort the namespace walk even on error.

ACPI Low Power S0 Idle capabilities are announced via FADT table and can
be used to inform the kernel about the presence of one or more Low Power
Idle (LPI) entries as descried in LPIT table. LPIT table can exist
independently even if the FADT S0 Idle flag is not set and thus it could
confuse user since the following cpuidle attributes are created.

/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuidle/low\_power\_idle\_system\_residency\_us

we will try to make an out-of-bounds access.

Fix a bug that happens in the following scenario:
1) suspend without WoWLAN
2) mac80211 calls drv\_stop because of the suspend
3) \_\_iwl\_mvm\_mac\_stop deallocates the aux station
4) during drv\_stop the firmware crashes
5) iwlmvm:
\* sets IWL\_MVM\_STATUS\_HW\_RESTART\_REQUESTED
\* asks mac80211 to kick the restart flow
6) mac80211 puts the restart worker into a freezable
queue which means that the worker will not run for now
since the workqueue is already frozen
7) ...
8) resume
9) mac80211 runs ieee80211\_reconfig as part of the resume
10) mac80211 detects that a restart flow has been requested
and that we are now resuming from suspend and cancels
the restart worker
11) mac80211 calls drv\_start()
12) \_\_iwl\_mvm\_mac\_start checks that IWL\_MVM\_STATUS\_HW\_RESTART\_REQUESTED
clears it, sets IWL\_MVM\_STATUS\_IN\_HW\_RESTART and calls
iwl\_mvm\_restart\_cleanup()
13) iwl\_fw\_error\_dump gets called and accesses the device
to get debug data
14) iwl\_mvm\_up adds the aux station
15) iwl\_mvm\_add\_aux\_sta() allocates an internal station for
the aux station
16) iwl\_mvm\_allocate\_int\_sta() tests IWL\_MVM\_STATUS\_IN\_HW\_RESTART
and doesn't really allocate a station ID for the aux
station
17) a new queue is added for the aux station
Note that steps from 5 to 9 aren't really part of the
problem but were described for the sake of completeness.
Once the iwl\_mvm\_mac\_stop() is called, the device is not
accessible, meaning that step 12) can't succeed and we'll

The station id of the aux station is set to 0xff in step 3

iwlwifi: pcie: avoid empty free RB queue
[ Upstream commit 868a1e863f95183f00809363fefba6d4f5bcd116 ]
If all free RB queues are empty, the driver will never restock the
free RB queue. That's because the restocking happens in the Rx flow,
and if the free queue is empty there will be no Rx.
Although there's a background worker (a.k.a. allocator) allocating
memory for RBs so that the Rx handler can restock them, the worker may
run only after the free queue has become empty (and then it is too
late for restocking as explained above).
There is a solution for that called 'emergency': If the number of used
RB's reaches half the amount of all RB's, the Rx handler will not wait
for the allocator but immediately allocate memory for the used RB's
and restock the free queue.
But, since the used RB's is per queue, it may happen that the used
RB's are spread between the queues such that the emergency check will
fail for each of the queues
(and still run out of RBs, causing the above symptom).
To fix it, move to emergency mode if the sum of \*all\* used RBs (for
all Rx queues) reaches half the amount of all RB's

mtd: rawnand: denali: set SPARE\_AREA\_SKIP\_BYTES register to 8 if unset
[ Upstream commit 0d55c668b218a1db68b5044bce4de74e1bd0f0c8 ]
NAND devices need additional data area (OOB) for error correction,
but it is also used for Bad Block Marker (BBM). In many cases, the
first byte in OOB is used for BBM, but the location actually depends
on chip vendors. The NAND controller should preserve the precious
BBM to keep track of bad blocks.
In Denali IP, the SPARE\_AREA\_SKIP\_BYTES register is used to specify
the number of bytes to skip from the start of OOB. The ECC engine
will automatically skip the specified number of bytes when it gets
access to OOB area.
The same value for SPARE\_AREA\_SKIP\_BYTES should be used between
firmware and the operating system if you intend to use the NAND
device across the control hand-off.
In fact, the current denali.c code expects firmware to have already
set the SPARE\_AREA\_SKIP\_BYTES register, then reads the value out.
If no firmware (or bootloader) has initialized the controller, the
register value is zero, which is the default after power-on-reset.
In other words, the Linux driver cannot initialize the controller
by itself.
Some possible solutions are:
[1] Add a DT property to specify the skipped bytes in OOB
[2] Associate the preferred value with compatible
[3] Hard-code the default value in the driver
My first attempt was [1], but in the review process, [3] was suggested
as a counter-implementation.
(https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/983055/)
The default value 8 was chosen to match to the boot ROM of the UniPhier
platform. The preferred value may vary by platform. If so, please
trade up to a different solution.

cpupower: Fix coredump on VMWare
[ Upstream commit f69ffc5d3db8f1f03fd6d1df5930f9a1fbd787b6 ]
cpupower crashes on VMWare guests. The guests have the AMD PStateDef MSR
(0xC0010064 + state number) set to zero. As a result fid and did are zero
and the crash occurs because of a divide by zero (cof = fid/did). This
can be prevented by checking the enable bit in the PStateDef MSR before
calculating cof. By doing this the value of pstate[i] remains zero and
the value can be tested before displaying the active Pstates.
Check the enable bit in the PstateDef register for all supported families
and only print out enabled Pstates.

dma\_{,un}map\_sg expect an enum of type dma\_data\_direction but this

use dma\_data\_direction for these two functions.
There are two places that strictly require an enum of type
dma\_transfer\_direction: the direction member in struct dma\_slave\_config
and the direction parameter in dmaengine\_prep\_slave\_sg. To avoid using
an explicit cast, add a simple function, ep93xx\_dma\_data\_to\_trans\_dir,
to safely map between the two types because they are not 1 to 1 in

In pblk, when a new line is allocated, metadata for the previously

that is shared through time and contexts across different lines and
therefore protected by a lock. Unfortunately, this lock is not properly
covering all the metadata used for sharing this memory regions,
resulting in a race condition.
This patch fixes this race condition by protecting this metadata

hwmon: (pwm-fan) Set fan speed to 0 on suspend
[ Upstream commit 95dcd64bc5a27080beaa344edfe5bdcca3d2e7dc ]
Technically this is not required because disabling the PWM should be
enough. However, when support for atomic operations was implemented in
the PWM subsystem, only actual changes to the PWM channel are applied
during pwm\_config(), which means that during after resume from suspend
the old settings won't be applied.
One possible solution is for the PWM driver to implement its own PM
operations such that settings from before suspend get applied on resume.
This has the disadvantage of completely ignoring any particular ordering
requirements that PWM user drivers might have, so it is best to leave it
up to the user drivers to apply the settings that they want at the
appropriate time.
Another way to solve this would be to read back the current state of the
PWM at the time of resume. That way, in case the configuration was lost
during suspend, applying the old settings in PWM user drivers would
actually get them applied because they differ from the current settings.
However, not all PWM drivers support reading the hardware state, and not
all hardware may support it.
The best workaround at this point seems to be to let PWM user drivers
tell the PWM subsystem that the PWM is turned off by, in addition to
disabling it, also setting the duty cycle to 0. This causes the resume
operation to apply a configuration that is different from the current
configuration, resulting in the proper state from before suspend getting
restored.

nfp: devlink port split support for 1x100G CXP NIC
[ Upstream commit 5948185b97fa1f83d7855e638a72982a1073ebf5 ]
This commit makes it possible to use devlink to split the 100G CXP
Netronome into two 40G interfaces. Currently when you ask for 2
interfaces, the math in src/nfp\_devlink.c:nfp\_devlink\_port\_split
calculates that you want 5 lanes per port because for some reason
eth\_port.port\_lanes=10 (shouldn't this be 12 for CXP?). What we really
want when asking for 2 breakout interfaces is 4 lanes per port. This
commit makes that happen by calculating based on 8 lanes if 10 are
present.

arm64: cpufeature: ctr: Fix cpu capability check for late CPUs
[ Upstream commit 8ab66cbe63aeaf9e5970fb4aaef1c660fca59321 ]
The matches() routine for a capability must honor the "scope"
passed to it and return the proper results.
i.e, when passed with SCOPE\_LOCAL\_CPU, it should check the
status of the capability on the current CPU. This is used by
verify\_local\_cpu\_capabilities() on a late secondary CPU to make
sure that it's compliant with the established system features.
However, ARM64\_HAS\_CACHE\_{IDC/DIC} always checks the system wide
registers and this could mean that a late secondary CPU could return
"true" (since the CPU hasn't updated the system wide registers yet)
and thus lead the system in an inconsistent state, where
the system assumes it has IDC/DIC feature, while the new CPU
doesn't.

locking/lockdep: Fix debug\_locks off performance problem
[ Upstream commit 9506a7425b094d2f1d9c877ed5a78f416669269b ]
It was found that when debug\_locks was turned off because of a problem
found by the lockdep code, the system performance could drop quite
significantly when the lock\_stat code was also configured into the
kernel. For instance, parallel kernel build time on a 4-socket x86-64
server nearly doubled.
Further analysis into the cause of the slowdown traced back to the
frequent call to debug\_locks\_off() from the \_\_lock\_acquired() function
probably due to some inconsistent lockdep states with debug\_locks
off. The debug\_locks\_off() function did an unconditional atomic xchg
to write a 0 value into debug\_locks which had already been set to 0.
This led to severe cacheline contention in the cacheline that held
debug\_locks. As debug\_locks is being referenced in quite a few different
places in the kernel, this greatly slow down the system performance.
To prevent that trashing of debug\_locks cacheline, lock\_acquired()
and lock\_contended() now checks the state of debug\_locks before
proceeding. The debug\_locks\_off() function is also modified to check
debug\_locks before calling \_\_debug\_locks\_off().

drm: Get ref on CRTC commit object when waiting for flip\_done
[ Upstream commit 4364bcb2cd21d042bde4776448417ddffbc54045 ]
This fixes a general protection fault, caused by accessing the contents
of a flip\_done completion object that has already been freed. It occurs
due to the preemption of a non-blocking commit worker thread W by
another commit thread X. X continues to clear its atomic state at the
end, destroying the CRTC commit object that W still needs. Switching
back to W and accessing the commit objects then leads to bad results.
Worker W becomes preemptable when waiting for flip\_done to complete. At
this point, a frequently occurring commit thread X can take over. Here's
an example where W is a worker thread that flips on both CRTCs, and X
does a legacy cursor update on both CRTCs:
...
1. W does flip work
2. W runs commit\_hw\_done()
3. W waits for flip\_done on CRTC 1
4. > flip\_done for CRTC 1 completes
5. W finishes waiting for CRTC 1
6. W waits for flip\_done on CRTC 2
7. > Preempted by X
8. > flip\_done for CRTC 2 completes
9. X atomic\_check: hw\_done and flip\_done are complete on all CRTCs
10. X updates cursor on both CRTCs
11. X destroys atomic state
12. X done
13. > Switch back to W
14. W waits for flip\_done on CRTC 2
15. W raises general protection fault
The error looks like so:
general protection fault: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP PTI

Note that i915 has this issue masked, since hw\_done is signaled after
waiting for flip\_done. Doing so will block the cursor update from
happening until hw\_done is signaled, preventing the cursor commit from
destroying the state.
v2: The reference on the commit object needs to be obtained before
hw\_done() is signaled, since that's the point where another commit
is allowed to modify the state. Assuming that the
new\_crtc\_state->commit object still exists within flip\_done() is
incorrect.
Fix by getting a reference in setup\_commit(), and releasing it
during default\_clear().

net: qla3xxx: Remove overflowing shift statement
[ Upstream commit 8c3bf9b62b667456a57aefcf1689e826df146159 ]
Clang currently warns:
drivers/net/ethernet/qlogic/qla3xxx.c:384:24: warning: signed shift
result (0xF00000000) requires 37 bits to represent, but 'int' only has
32 bits [-Wshift-overflow]
((ISP\_NVRAM\_MASK << 16) | qdev->eeprom\_cmd\_data));
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ^ ~~
1 warning generated.
The warning is certainly accurate since ISP\_NVRAM\_MASK is defined as
(0x000F << 16) which is then shifted by 16, resulting in 64424509440,
well above UINT\_MAX.
Given that this is the only location in this driver where ISP\_NVRAM\_MASK
is shifted again, it seems likely that ISP\_NVRAM\_MASK was originally
defined without a shift and during the move of the shift to the
definition, this statement wasn't properly removed (since ISP\_NVRAM\_MASK
is used in the statenent right above this). Only the maintainers can
confirm this since this statment has been here since the driver was
first added to the kernel.

So instead handle the case where we get invalid function names for
inlined frames and use a fallback '??' function name instead.
While this crash was originally reported by Hadrien for rust code, I can
now also reproduce it with trivial C++ code. Indeed, it seems like
libbfd fails to interpret the debug information for the inline frame
symbol name:

perf tools: Fix use of alternatives to find JDIR
[ Upstream commit 36b8d4628d3cc8f5a748e508cce8673bc00fc63c ]
When a build is run from something like a cron job, the user's $PATH is
rather minimal, of note, not including /usr/sbin in my own case. Because
of that, an automated rpm package build ultimately fails to find
libperf-jvmti.so, because somewhere within the build, this happens...
/bin/sh: alternatives: command not found
/bin/sh: alternatives: command not found
Makefile.config:849: No openjdk development package found, please install
JDK package, e.g. openjdk-8-jdk, java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel
...and while the build continues, libperf-jvmti.so isn't built, and
things fall down when rpm tries to find all the %files specified. Exact
same system builds everything just fine when the job is launched from a
login shell instead of a cron job, since alternatives is in $PATH, so
openjdk is actually found.
The test required to get into this section of code actually specifies
the full path, as does a block just above it, so let's do that here too.

sched/fair: Fix the min\_vruntime update logic in dequeue\_entity()
[ Upstream commit 9845c49cc9bbb317a0bc9e9cf78d8e09d54c9af0 ]
The comment and the code around the update\_min\_vruntime() call in
dequeue\_entity() are not in agreement.
>From commit:
b60205c7c558 ("sched/fair: Fix min\_vruntime tracking")
I think that we want to update min\_vruntime when a task is sleeping/migrating.
So, the check is inverted there - fix it.

r8169: Enable MSI-X on RTL8106e
[ Upstream commit d49c88d7677ba737e9d2759a87db0402d5ab2607 ]
Originally, we have an issue where r8169 MSI-X interrupt is broken after
S3 suspend/resume on RTL8106e of ASUS X441UAR.

We found the all of the values in PCI BAR=4 of the ethernet adapter
become 0xFF after system resumes. That breaks the MSI-X interrupt.
Therefore, we can only fall back to MSI interrupt to fix the issue at
that time.
However, there is a commit which resolves the drivers getting nothing in
PCI BAR=4 after system resumes. It is 04cb3ae895d7 "PCI: Reprogram
bridge prefetch registers on resume" by Daniel Drake.
After apply the patch, the ethernet adapter works fine before suspend
and after resume. So, we can revert the workaround after the commit
"PCI: Reprogram bridge prefetch registers on resume" is merged into main
tree.
This patch reverts commit 7bb05b85bc2d1a1b647b91424b2ed4a18e6ecd81

perf vendor events intel: Fix wrong filter\_band\* values for uncore events
[ Upstream commit 94aafb74cee0002e2f2eb6dc5376f54d5951ab4d ]
Michael reported that he could not stat following event:
$ perf stat -e unc\_p\_freq\_ge\_1200mhz\_cycles -a -- ls
event syntax error: '..e\_1200mhz\_cycles'
\\_\_\_ value too big for format, maximum is 255
Run 'perf list' for a list of valid events
The event is unwrapped into:
uncore\_pcu/event=0xb,filter\_band0=1200/
where filter\_band0 format says it's one byte only:
# cat uncore\_pcu/format/filter\_band0
config1:0-7
while JSON files specifies bigger number:
"Filter": "filter\_band0=1200",
all the filter\_band\* formats show 1 byte width:
# cat uncore\_pcu/format/filter\_band1
config1:8-15
# cat uncore\_pcu/format/filter\_band2
config1:16-23
# cat uncore\_pcu/format/filter\_band3
config1:24-31
The reason of the issue is that filter\_band\* values are supposed to be
in 100Mhz units.. it's stated in the JSON help for the events, like:
filter\_band3=XXX, with XXX in 100Mhz units
This patch divides the filter\_band\* values by 100, plus there's couple
of changes that actually change the number completely, like:
- "Filter": "edge=1,filter\_band2=4000",
+ "Filter": "edge=1,filter\_band2=30",

Revert "perf tools: Fix PMU term format max value calculation"
[ Upstream commit 1b9caa10b31dda0866f4028e4bfb923fb6e4072f ]
This reverts commit ac0e2cd555373ae6f8f3a3ad3fbbf5b6d1e7aaaa.
Michael reported an issue with oversized terms values assignment
and I noticed there was actually a misunderstanding of the max
value check in the past.
The above commit's changelog says:
If bit 21 is set, there is parsing issues as below.
$ perf stat -a -e uncore\_qpi\_0/event=0x200002,umask=0x8/
event syntax error: '..pi\_0/event=0x200002,umask=0x8/'
\\_\_\_ value too big for format, maximum is 511
But there's no issue there, because the event value is distributed
along the value defined by the format. Even if the format defines
separated bit, the value is treated as a continual number, which
should follow the format definition.
In above case it's 9-bit value with last bit separated:
$ cat uncore\_qpi\_0/format/event
config:0-7,21
Hence the value 0x200002 is correctly reported as format violation,
because it exceeds 9 bits. It should have been 0x102 instead, which
sets the 9th bit - the bit 21 of the format.
$ perf stat -vv -a -e uncore\_qpi\_0/event=0x102,umask=0x8/

nvme: remove ns sibling before clearing path
[ Upstream commit 48f78be3326052a7718678ff9a78d6d884a50323 ]
The code had been clearing a namespace being deleted as the current
path while that namespace was still in the path siblings list. It is
possible a new IO could set that namespace back to the current path
since it appeared to be an eligable path to select, which may result in
a use-after-free error.
This patch ensures a namespace being removed is not eligable to be reset
as a current path prior to clearing it as the current path.

drm: fix use of freed memory in drm\_mode\_setcrtc
[ Upstream commit 064253c1c0625efd0362a0b7ecdbe8bee2a2904d ]
drm\_mode\_setcrtc() retries modesetting in case one of the functions it
calls returns -EDEADLK. connector\_set, mode and fb are freed before
retrying, but they are not set to NULL. This can cause
drm\_mode\_setcrtc() to use those variables.
For example: On the first try \_\_drm\_mode\_set\_config\_internal() returns
-EDEADLK. connector\_set, mode and fb are freed. Next retry starts, and
drm\_modeset\_lock\_all\_ctx() returns -EDEADLK, and we jump to 'out'. The
code will happily try to release all three again.
This leads to crashes of different kinds, depending on the sequence the
EDEADLKs happen.
Fix this by setting the three variables to NULL at the start of the
retry loop.

x86/speculation: Support Enhanced IBRS on future CPUs
commit 706d51681d636a0c4a5ef53395ec3b803e45ed4d upstream.
Future Intel processors will support "Enhanced IBRS" which is an "always
on" mode i.e. IBRS bit in SPEC\_CTRL MSR is enabled once and never
disabled.
From the specification [1]:
"With enhanced IBRS, the predicted targets of indirect branches
executed cannot be controlled by software that was executed in a less
privileged predictor mode or on another logical processor. As a
result, software operating on a processor with enhanced IBRS need not
use WRMSR to set IA32\_SPEC\_CTRL.IBRS after every transition to a more
privileged predictor mode. Software can isolate predictor modes
effectively simply by setting the bit once. Software need not disable
enhanced IBRS prior to entering a sleep state such as MWAIT or HLT."
If Enhanced IBRS is supported by the processor then use it as the
preferred spectre v2 mitigation mechanism instead of Retpoline. Intel's
Retpoline white paper [2] states:
"Retpoline is known to be an effective branch target injection (Spectre
variant 2) mitigation on Intel processors belonging to family 6
(enumerated by the CPUID instruction) that do not have support for
enhanced IBRS. On processors that support enhanced IBRS, it should be
used for mitigation instead of retpoline."
The reason why Enhanced IBRS is the recommended mitigation on processors
which support it is that these processors also support CET which
provides a defense against ROP attacks. Retpoline is very similar to ROP
techniques and might trigger false positives in the CET defense.
If Enhanced IBRS is selected as the mitigation technique for spectre v2,
the IBRS bit in SPEC\_CTRL MSR is set once at boot time and never
cleared. Kernel also has to make sure that IBRS bit remains set after
VMEXIT because the guest might have cleared the bit. This is already
covered by the existing x86\_spec\_ctrl\_set\_guest() and
x86\_spec\_ctrl\_restore\_host() speculation control functions.
Enhanced IBRS still requires IBPB for full mitigation.

x86/mm/pat: Disable preemption around \_\_flush\_tlb\_all()

The WARN\_ON\_ONCE(\_\_read\_cr3() != build\_cr3()) in switch\_mm\_irqs\_off()

get\_page\_from\_freelist() -> post\_alloc\_hook() -> \_\_kernel\_map\_pages()
with CONFIG\_DEBUG\_PAGEALLOC enabled.
Disable preemption during CR3 reset / \_\_flush\_tlb\_all() and add a comment
why preemption has to be disabled so it won't be removed accidentaly.
Add another preemptible() check in \_\_flush\_tlb\_all() to catch callers with
enabled preemption when PGE is enabled, because PGE enabled does not
trigger the warning in \_\_native\_flush\_tlb(). Suggested by Andy Lutomirski.

Enable this feature if
- the CPU is vulnerable to spectre v2
- the CPU supports SMT and has SMT siblings online
- spectre\_v2 mitigation autoselection is enabled (default)
After some previous discussion, this leaves STIBP on all the time, as wrmsr
on crossing kernel boundary is a no-no. This could perhaps later be a bit
more optimized (like disabling it in NOHZ, experiment with disabling it in
idle, etc) if needed.
Note that the synchronization of the mask manipulation via newly added
spec\_ctrl\_mutex is currently not strictly needed, as the only updater is
already being serialized by cpu\_add\_remove\_lock, but let's make this a
little bit more future-proof.

ALSA: ca0106: Disable IZD on SB0570 DAC to fix audio pops
commit ac237c28d5ac1b241d58b1b7b4b9fa10efb22fb5 upstream.
The Creative Audigy SE (SB0570) card currently exhibits an audible pop
whenever playback is stopped or resumed, or during silent periods of an
audio stream. Initialise the IZD bit to the 0 to eliminate these pops.
The Infinite Zero Detection (IZD) feature on the DAC causes the output
to be shunted to Vcap after 2048 samples of silence. This discharges the
AC coupling capacitor through the output and causes the aforementioned
pop/click noise.
The behaviour of the IZD bit is described on page 15 of the WM8768GEDS
datasheet: "With IZD=1, applying MUTE for 1024 consecutive input samples
will cause all outputs to be connected directly to VCAP. This also
happens if 2048 consecutive zero input samples are applied to all 6
channels, and IZD=0. It will be removed as soon as any channel receives
a non-zero input". I believe the second sentence might be referring to
IZD=1 instead of IZD=0 given the observed behaviour of the card.
This change should make the DAC initialisation consistent with
Creative's Windows driver, as this popping persists when initialising
the card in Linux and soft rebooting into Windows, but is not present on
a cold boot to Windows.

parisc: Fix exported address of os\_hpmc handler
commit 99a3ae51d557d8e38a7aece65678a31f9db215ee upstream.
In the C-code we need to put the physical address of the hpmc handler in
the interrupt vector table (IVA) in order to get HPMCs working. Since
on parisc64 function pointers are indirect (in fact they are function
descriptors) we instead export the address as variable and not as
function.
This reverts a small part of commit f39cce654f9a ("parisc: Add

Fix a long-existing small nasty bug in the map\_pages() implementation which
leads to overwriting already written pte entries with zero, \*if\* map\_pages() is
called a second time with an end address which isn't aligned on a pmd boundry.
This happens for example if we want to remap only the text segment read/write
in order to run alternative patching on the code. Exiting the loop when we
reach the end address fixes this.

acpi, nfit: Fix Address Range Scrub completion tracking
commit d3abaf43bab8d5b0a3c6b982100d9e2be96de4ad upstream.
The Address Range Scrub implementation tried to skip running scrubs
against ranges that were already scrubbed by the BIOS. Unfortunately
that support also resulted in early scrub completions as evidenced by
this debug output from nfit\_test:
nd\_region region9: ARS: range 1 short complete
nd\_region region3: ARS: range 1 short complete
nd\_region region4: ARS: range 2 ARS start (0)
nd\_region region4: ARS: range 2 short complete
...i.e. completions without any indications that the scrub was started.
This state of affairs was hard to see in the code due to the
proliferation of state bits and mistakenly trying to track done state
per-range when the completion is a global property of the bus.
So, kill the four ARS state bits (ARS\_REQ, ARS\_REQ\_REDO, ARS\_DONE, and
ARS\_SHORT), and replace them with just 2 request flags ARS\_REQ\_SHORT and
ARS\_REQ\_LONG. The implementation will still complete and reap the
results of BIOS initiated ARS, but it will not attempt to use that
information to affect the completion status of scrubbing the ranges from
a Linux perspective.
Instead, try to synchronously run a short ARS per range at init time and
schedule a long scrub in the background. If ARS is busy with an ARS
request, schedule both a short and a long scrub for when ARS returns to
idle. This logic also satisfies the intent of what ARS\_REQ\_REDO was
trying to achieve. The new rule is that the REQ flag stays set until the
next successful ars\_start() for that range.
With the new policy that the REQ flags are not cleared until the next
start, the implementation no longer loses requests as can be seen from
the following log:
nd\_region region3: ARS: range 1 ARS start short (0)
nd\_region region9: ARS: range 1 ARS start short (0)
nd\_region region3: ARS: range 1 complete
nd\_region region4: ARS: range 2 ARS start short (0)
nd\_region region9: ARS: range 1 complete
nd\_region region9: ARS: range 1 ARS start long (0)
nd\_region region4: ARS: range 2 complete
nd\_region region3: ARS: range 1 ARS start long (0)
nd\_region region9: ARS: range 1 complete
nd\_region region3: ARS: range 1 complete
nd\_region region4: ARS: range 2 ARS start long (0)
nd\_region region4: ARS: range 2 complete
...note that the nfit\_test emulated driver provides 2 buses, that is why
some of the range indices are duplicated. Notice that each range
now successfully completes a short and long scrub.

ACPICA: AML Parser: fix parse loop to correctly skip erroneous extended opcodes
commit c64baa3a6fa207d112706bc5e7fd645cd8a8663f upstream.
AML opcodes come in two lengths: 1-byte opcodes and 2-byte, extended opcodes.
If an error occurs due to illegal opcodes during table load, the AML parser
needs to continue loading the table. In order to do this, it needs to skip
parsing of the offending opcode and operands associated with that opcode.
This change fixes the AML parse loop to correctly skip parsing of incorrect
extended opcodes. Previously, only the short opcodes were skipped correctly.

ACPICA: AML interpreter: add region addresses in global list during initialization
commit 4abb951b73ff0a8a979113ef185651aa3c8da19b upstream.
The table load process omitted adding the operation region address
range to the global list. This omission is problematic because the OS
queries the global list to check for address range conflicts before
deciding which drivers to load. This commit may result in warning
messages that look like the following:
[ 7.871761] ACPI Warning: system\_IO range 0x00000428-0x0000042F conflicts with op\_region 0x00000400-0x0000047F (\PMIO) (20180531/utaddress-213)
[ 7.871769] ACPI: If an ACPI driver is available for this device, you should use it instead of the native driver
However, these messages do not signify regressions. It is a result of
properly adding address ranges within the global address list.

ACPI / OSL: Use 'jiffies' as the time bassis for acpi\_os\_get\_timer()

pcmcia: Implement CLKRUN protocol disabling for Ricoh bridges
commit 95691e3eddc41da2d1cd3cca51fecdfb46bd85bc upstream.
Currently, "disable\_clkrun" yenta\_socket module parameter is only
implemented for TI CardBus bridges.
Add also an implementation for Ricoh bridges that have the necessary
setting documented in publicly available datasheets.
Tested on a RL5C476II with a Sunrich C-160 CardBus NIC that doesn't work
correctly unless the CLKRUN protocol is disabled.
Let's also make it clear in its description that the "disable\_clkrun"
module parameter only works on these two previously mentioned brands of
CardBus bridges.

cpufreq: conservative: Take limits changes into account properly
commit da5e79bc70b84971d2b3a55fb252e34e51d81d48 upstream.
If the policy limits change between invocations of cs\_dbs\_update(),
the requested frequency value stored in dbs\_info may not be updated
and the function may use a stale value of it next time. Moreover, if
idle periods are takem into account by cs\_dbs\_update(), the requested
frequency value stored in dbs\_info may be below the min policy limit,
which is incorrect.
To fix these problems, always update the requested frequency value
in dbs\_info along with the local copy of it when the previous
requested frequency is beyond the policy limits and avoid decreasing
the requested frequency below the min policy limit when taking
idle periods into account.

hwmon: (pmbus) Fix page count auto-detection.
commit e7c6a55606b5c46b449d76588968b4d8caae903f upstream.
Devices with compatible="pmbus" field have zero initial page count,
and pmbus\_clear\_faults() being called before the page count auto-
detection does not actually clear faults because it depends on the
page count. Non-cleared faults in its turn may fail the subsequent
page count auto-detection.
This patch fixes this problem by calling pmbus\_clear\_fault\_page()
for currently set page and calling pmbus\_clear\_faults() after the
page count was detected.

bcache: fix miss key refill->end in writeback
commit 2d6cb6edd2c7fb4f40998895bda45006281b1ac5 upstream.
refill->end record the last key of writeback, for example, at the first
time, keys (1,128K) to (1,1024K) are flush to the backend device, but
the end key (1,1024K) is not included, since the bellow code:
if (bkey\_cmp(k, refill->end) >= 0) {
ret = MAP\_DONE;
goto out;
}
And in the next time when we refill writeback keybuf again, we searched
key start from (1,1024K), and got a key bigger than it, so the key
(1,1024K) missed.
This patch modify the above code, and let the end key to be included to
the writeback key buffer.

spi: bcm-qspi: switch back to reading flash using smaller chunks
commit 940ec770c295682993d1cccce3081fd7c74fece8 upstream.
Fixing/optimizing bcm\_qspi\_bspi\_read() performance introduced two
changes:
1) It added a loop to read all requested data using multiple BSPI ops.
2) It bumped max size of a single BSPI block request from 256 to 512 B.
The later change resulted in occasional BSPI timeouts causing a
regression.
For some unknown reason hardware doesn't always handle reads as expected
when using 512 B chunks. In such cases it may happen that BSPI returns
amount of requested bytes without the last 1-3 ones. It provides the
remaining bytes later but doesn't raise an interrupt until another LR
start.
Switching back to 256 B reads fixes that problem and regression.

mtd: rawnand: marvell: fix the IRQ handler complete() condition
commit 53c83b59759c1ee213f5ffa194909daee8902a28 upstream.
With the current implementation, the complete() in the IRQ handler is
supposed to be called only if the register status has one or the other
RDY bit set. Other events might trigger an interrupt as well if
enabled, but should not end-up with a complete() call.
For this purpose, the code was checking if the other bits were set, in
this case complete() was not called. This is wrong as two events might
happen in a very tight time-frame and if the NDSR status read reports
two bits set (eg. RDY(0) and RDDREQ) at the same time, complete() was
not called.
This logic would lead to timeouts in marvell\_nfc\_wait\_op() and has
been observed on PXA boards (NFCv1) in the Hamming write path.

### Bug Description

Jann Horn reported that nested user namespaces with more than five mappings allow gaining privilege over an inode.

Here is my write up of how this happens:

Currently, the forward map and reverse map are copied and sorted at the same time before necessary updates to the forward map have been performed. This has the consequence that the forward map receives the necessary updates while the reverse map does not leaving it with invalid data. Specifically, this means that the lower ids of the forward mapping will be correctly mapped to appropriate kernel ids, while the lower ids of the reverse mapping will not.

This breaks inode\_owner\_or\_capable() and privileged\_wrt\_inode\_uidgid() which call helpers that need to access the reverse mapping. Thus, a process can incorrectly appear to be capable relative to an inode.

Note that the sorting logic is only triggered when more than five extents are specified and when user namespaces are nested. Hence, only containers with complex mappings in nested user namespaces are affected.

To fix this issue we need to ensures that the translation happens for both the forward and reverse mappings. First, the forward mappings are sorted and its lower ids translated into kernel ids. After this the forward mapping is copied and into the reverse mapping and the reverse mappings sorted.

A proposed patch is appended here.

# USN-3832-1: Linux kernel (AWS) vulnerabilities

30 November 2018

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.10](/security/notices?release=cosmic)

## Packages

* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems

## Details

Jann Horn discovered that the procfs file system implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly restrict the ability to inspect the kernel

stack of an arbitrary task. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-17972](/security/CVE-2018-17972))

Jann Horn discovered that the mremap() system call in the Linux kernel did

not properly flush the TLB when completing, potentially leaving access to a

physical page after it has been released to the page allocator. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash), expose

sensitive information, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-18281](/security/CVE-2018-18281))

It was discovered that the BPF verifier in the Linux kernel did not

correctly compute numeric bounds in some situations. A local attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-18445](/security/CVE-2018-18445))

Daniel Dadap discovered that the module loading implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly enforce signed module loading when booted with UEFI

Secure Boot in some situations. A local privileged attacker could use this

to execute untrusted code in the kernel. ([CVE-2018-18653](/security/CVE-2018-18653))

Jann Horn discovered that the Linux kernel mishandles mapping UID or GID

ranges inside nested user namespaces in some situations. A local attacker

could use this to bypass access controls on resources outside the

namespace. ([CVE-2018-18955](/security/CVE-2018-18955))

Philipp Wendler discovered that the overlayfs implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly verify the directory contents permissions from

within a unprivileged user namespace. A local attacker could use this to

expose sensitive information (protected file names). ([CVE-2018-6559](/security/CVE-2018-6559))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.10

* [linux-image-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws)
  -
  [4.18.0.1006.6](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws/4.18.0-1006.7)
* [linux-image-4.18.0-1006-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws)
  -
  [4.18.0-1006.7](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws/4.18.0-1006.7)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

XXX MAYBE WITH XXX

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

userns: also map extents in the reverse map to kernel IDsThe current logic first clones the extent array and sorts both copies, then
maps the lower IDs of the forward mapping into the lower namespace, but
doesn't map the lower IDs of the reverse mapping.
This means that code in a nested user namespace with >5 extents will see
incorrect IDs. It also breaks some access checks, like
inode\_owner\_or\_capable() and privileged\_wrt\_inode\_uidgid(), so a process
can incorrectly appear to be capable relative to an inode.
To fix it, we have to make sure that the "lower\_first" members of extents
in both arrays are translated; and we have to make sure that the reverse
map is sorted \*after\* the translation (since otherwise the translation can
break the sorting).
This is CVE-2018-18955.

# USN-3835-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

3 December 2018

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.10](/security/notices?release=cosmic)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel
* [linux-gcp](/security/cves?package=linux-gcp) - Linux kernel for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) systems
* [linux-kvm](/security/cves?package=linux-kvm) - Linux kernel for cloud environments
* [linux-raspi2](/security/cves?package=linux-raspi2) - Linux kernel for Raspberry Pi 2

## Details

Jann Horn discovered that the procfs file system implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly restrict the ability to inspect the kernel

stack of an arbitrary task. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-17972](/security/CVE-2018-17972))

Jann Horn discovered that the mremap() system call in the Linux kernel did

not properly flush the TLB when completing, potentially leaving access to a

physical page after it has been released to the page allocator. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash), expose

sensitive information, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-18281](/security/CVE-2018-18281))

It was discovered that the BPF verifier in the Linux kernel did not

correctly compute numeric bounds in some situations. A local attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-18445](/security/CVE-2018-18445))

Daniel Dadap discovered that the module loading implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly enforce signed module loading when booted with UEFI

Secure Boot in some situations. A local privileged attacker could use this

to execute untrusted code in the kernel. ([CVE-2018-18653](/security/CVE-2018-18653))

Jann Horn discovered that the Linux kernel mishandles mapping UID or GID

ranges inside nested user namespaces in some situations. A local attacker

could use this to bypass access controls on resources outside the

namespace. ([CVE-2018-18955](/security/CVE-2018-18955))

Philipp Wendler discovered that the overlayfs implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly verify the directory contents permissions from

within a unprivileged user namespace. A local attacker could use this to

expose sensitive information (protected file names). ([CVE-2018-6559](/security/CVE-2018-6559))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

In the Linux kernel 4.15.x through 4.19.x before 4.19.2, map\_write() in
kernel/user\_namespace.c allows privilege escalation because it mishandles
nested user namespaces with more than 5 UID or GID ranges. A user who has
CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN in an affected user namespace can bypass access controls on
resources outside the namespace, as demonstrated by reading /etc/shadow.
This occurs because an ID transformation takes place properly for the
namespaced-to-kernel direction but not for the kernel-to-namespaced
direction.

## From the Ubuntu Security Team

Jann Horn discovered that the Linux kernel mishandles mapping UID or GID
ranges inside nested user namespaces in some situations. A local attacker
could use this to bypass access controls on resources outside the
namespace.

# USN-3833-1: Linux kernel (AWS) vulnerabilities

30 November 2018

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)

## Packages

* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems

## Details

Jann Horn discovered that the Linux kernel mishandles mapping UID or GID

ranges inside nested user namespaces in some situations. A local attacker

could use this to bypass access controls on resources outside the

namespace. ([CVE-2018-18955](/security/CVE-2018-18955))

Philipp Wendler discovered that the overlayfs implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly verify the directory contents permissions from

within a unprivileged user namespace. A local attacker could use this to

expose sensitive information (protected file names). ([CVE-2018-6559](/security/CVE-2018-6559))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-1029-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws)
  -
  [4.15.0-1029.30](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws/4.15.0-1029.30)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# Linux - Broken uid/gid Mapping for Nested User Namespaces

#### EDB-ID:

###### 45886

#### CVE:

###### [2018-18955](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-18955)

**EDB Verified:**

#### Author:

###### [Google Security Research](/?author=7725)

**Vulnerable App:**

```
commit 6397fac4915a ("userns: bump idmap limits to 340") increases the number of
possible uid/gid mappings that a namespace can have from 5 to 340. This is
implemented by switching to a different data structure if the number of mappings
exceeds 5: Instead of linear search over an unsorted array of struct
uid_gid_extent, binary search over a sorted array of struct uid_gid_extent is
used. Because ID mappings are queried in both directions (kernel ID to
namespaced ID and namespaced ID to kernel ID), two copies of the array are
created, one per direction, and they are sorted differently.

In map_write(), at first, during the loop that calls insert_extent(), the member
lower_first of each struct uid_gid_extent contains an ID in the parent
namespace. Later, map_id_range_down() is used in a loop to replace these IDs in
the parent namespace with kernel IDs.

The problem is that, when the two sorted arrays are used, the new code omits the
ID transformation for the kernel->namespaced mapping; only the
namespaced->kernel mapping is transformed appropriately.

This means that if you first, from the init namespace, create a user namespace
NS1 with the following uid_map:

    0 100000 1000

and then, from NS1, create a nested user namespace NS2 with the following
uid_map:

    0 0 1
    1 1 1
    2 2 1
    3 3 1
    4 4 1
    5 5 995

then make_kuid(NS2, ...) will work properly, but from_kuid(NS2) will be an
identity mapping for UIDs in the range 0..1000.

Most users of from_kuid() are relatively boring, but kuid_has_mapping() is used
in inode_owner_or_capable() and privileged_wrt_inode_uidgid(); so you can abuse
this to gain the ability to override DAC security controls on files whose IDs
aren't mapped in your namespace.

To test this, I installed the "uidmap" package in a Ubuntu 18.04 VM with the
following /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid:

user@ubuntu-18-04-vm:~$ cat /etc/subuid
user:100000:65536
user2:165536:65536
user3:231072:65536
user@ubuntu-18-04-vm:~$ cat /etc/subgid
user:100000:65536
user2:165536:65536
user3:231072:65536
user@ubuntu-18-04-vm:~$

Then, as the user "user", I compiled the two attached helpers (subuid_shell.c
and subshell.c):

user@ubuntu-18-04-vm:~/userns_4_15$ gcc -o subuid_shell subuid_shell.c
user@ubuntu-18-04-vm:~/userns_4_15$ gcc -o subshell subshell.c

subuid_shell.c uses the newuidmap helper to set up a namespace that maps 1000
UIDs starting at 100000 to the namespaced UID 0; subshell.c requires namespaced
CAP_SYS_ADMIN and creates a user namespace that maps UIDs 0-999, using six
extents.

I used them as follows to read /etc/shadow:

user@ubuntu-18-04-vm:~/userns_4_15$ id
uid=1000(user) gid=1000(user) groups=1000(user),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),116(lpadmin),126(sambashare)

Here is a suggested patch (copy attached to avoid whitespace issues); does this
look sensible?

Subject: [PATCH] userns: also map extents in the reverse map to kernel IDs

The current logic first clones the extent array and sorts both copies, then
maps the lower IDs of the forward mapping into the lower namespace, but
doesn't map the lower IDs of the reverse mapping.

This means that code in a nested user namespace with >5 extents will see
incorrect IDs. It also breaks some access checks, like
inode_owner_or_capable() and privileged_wrt_inode_uidgid(), so a process
can incorrectly appear to be capable relative to an inode.

To fix it, we have to make sure that the "lower_first" members of extents
in both arrays are translated; and we have to make sure that the reverse
map is sorted *after* the translation (since otherwise the translation can
break the sorting).

This is CVE-2018-18955.

==================

(By the way: map_id_up_max() is probably pretty inefficient, especially when
retpoline mitigations are on, because it uses bsearch(), which is basically a
little bit of logic glue around indirect function calls. If you care about
speed, you might want to add an inline variant of bsearch() for places like
this.)

##### About The Exploit Database

Ã

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as âGoogle Hackingâ was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnnyâs talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term âGoogledorkâ to refer
to âa foolish or inept person as revealed by Googleâ. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a âGoogle problemâ but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term âdorkâ became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and âdorksâ were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

userns: also map extents in the reverse map to kernel IDsThe current logic first clones the extent array and sorts both copies, then
maps the lower IDs of the forward mapping into the lower namespace, but
doesn't map the lower IDs of the reverse mapping.
This means that code in a nested user namespace with >5 extents will see
incorrect IDs. It also breaks some access checks, like
inode\_owner\_or\_capable() and privileged\_wrt\_inode\_uidgid(), so a process
can incorrectly appear to be capable relative to an inode.
To fix it, we have to make sure that the "lower\_first" members of extents
in both arrays are translated; and we have to make sure that the reverse
map is sorted \*after\* the translation (since otherwise the translation can
break the sorting).
This is CVE-2018-18955.

# USN-3836-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

3 December 2018

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel
* [linux-gcp](/security/cves?package=linux-gcp) - Linux kernel for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) systems
* [linux-kvm](/security/cves?package=linux-kvm) - Linux kernel for cloud environments
* [linux-raspi2](/security/cves?package=linux-raspi2) - Linux kernel for Raspberry Pi 2

## Details

Jann Horn discovered that the Linux kernel mishandles mapping UID or GID

ranges inside nested user namespaces in some situations. A local attacker

could use this to bypass access controls on resources outside the

namespace. ([CVE-2018-18955](/security/CVE-2018-18955))

Philipp Wendler discovered that the overlayfs implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly verify the directory contents permissions from

within a unprivileged user namespace. A local attacker could use this to

expose sensitive information (protected file names). ([CVE-2018-6559](/security/CVE-2018-6559))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-1027-kvm](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-kvm)
  -
  [4.15.0-1027.27](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-kvm/4.15.0-1027.27)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-1029-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2)
  -
  [4.15.0-1029.31](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2/4.15.0-1029.31)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-42-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.15.0-42.45](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.15.0-42.45)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-42-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.15.0-42.45](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.15.0-42.45)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-42-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.15.0-42.45](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.15.0-42.45)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-42-snapdragon](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.15.0-42.45](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.15.0-42.45)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# Namespaces in operation, part 5: User namespaces

By **Michael Kerrisk**
February 27, 2013

Continuing our ongoing [series](/Articles/531114/#series_index) on namespaces, this
article looks more closely at user namespaces, a feature whose
implementation was (largely) completed in Linux 3.8. (The remaining work
consists of changes for [XFS](/Articles/538816/) and [a number of other filesystems](/Articles/538875/); the latter has
already been merged for 3.9.) User namespaces allow per-namespace mappings
of user and group IDs. This means that a process's user and group IDs
inside a user namespace can be different from its IDs outside of the
namespace. Most notably, a process can have a nonzero user ID outside a
namespace while at the same time having a user ID of zero inside the
namespace; in other words, the process is unprivileged for operations
outside the user namespace but has root privileges inside the namespace.
#### Creating user namespaces

User namespaces are created by specifying
the CLONE\_NEWUSER flag when
calling clone() or unshare(). Starting with Linux 3.8
(and unlike the flags used for creating other types of namespaces), no
privilege is required to create a user namespace. In our examples below,
all of the user namespaces are created using the unprivileged user ID 1000.

To begin investigating user namespaces, we'll make use of a small
program, [demo\_userns.c](/Articles/539941/), that
creates a child in a new user namespace. The child simply displays its
effective user and group IDs as well as its [capabilities](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html).
Running this program as an unprivileged user produces the following result:
```

    $ id -u          # Display effective user ID of shell process
    1000
    $ id -g          # Effective group ID of shell
    1000
    $ ./demo_userns
    eUID = 65534;  eGID = 65534;  capabilities: =ep

```

The output from this program shows some interesting details. One of
these is the capabilities that were assigned to the child process. The
string "=ep" (produced by the library function
cap\_to\_text(), which converts capability sets to a textual
representation) indicates that the child has a full set of permitted and
effective capabilities, even though the program was run from an
unprivileged account. When a user namespace is created, the first process
in the namespace is granted a full set of capabilities in the namespace.
This allows that process to perform any initializations that are necessary
in the namespace before other processes are created in the namespace.

The second point of interest is the user and group IDs of the child
process. As noted above, a process's user and group IDs inside and outside
a user namespace can be different. However, there needs to be a mapping
from the user IDs inside a user namespace to a corresponding set of user
IDs outside the namespace; the same is true of group IDs. This allows the
system to perform the appropriate permission checks when a process in a
user namespace performs operations that affect the wider system (e.g.,
sending a signal to a process outside the namespace or accessing a file).

System calls that return process user and group IDsâfor example,
getuid() and getgid()âalways return credentials as
they appear inside the user namespace in which the calling process resides.
If a user ID has no mapping inside the namespace, then system calls that
return user IDs return the value defined in the file
/proc/sys/kernel/overflowuid, which on a standard system defaults
to the value 65534. Initially, a user namespace has no user ID mapping, so
all user IDs inside the namespace map to this value. Likewise, a new user
namespace has no mappings for group IDs, and all unmapped group IDs map to
/proc/sys/kernel/overflowgid (which has the same default as
overflowuid).

There is one other important point worth noting that can't be gleaned from
the output above. Although the new process has a full set of capabilities
in the new user namespace, it has no capabilities in the parent namespace.
This is true regardless of the credentials and capabilities of the process
that calls clone(). In particular, even if root employs
clone(CLONE\_NEWUSER), the resulting child process will have no
capabilities in the parent namespace.

One final point to be made about the creation of user namespaces is
that namespaces can be nested; that is, each user namespace (other than the
initial user namespace) has a parent user namespace, and can have zero or
more child user namespaces. The parent of a user namespace is the user
namespace of the process that creates the user namespace via a call to
clone() or unshare() with the CLONE\_NEWUSER
flag. The significance of the parent-child relationship between user
namespaces will become clearer in the remainder of this article.
#### Mapping user and group IDs

Normally, one of the first steps after creating a new user namespace is to define
the mappings used for the user and group IDs of the processes that will be
created in that namespace.
This is done by writing mapping information to the
/proc/*PID*/uid\_map and
/proc/*PID*/gid\_map files corresponding to one of
the processes in the user namespace. (Initially, these two files are
empty.) This information consists of one or more lines, each of which
contains three values separated by white space:
```

    ID-inside-ns   ID-outside-ns   length

```

Together, the ID-inside-ns and length values define a
range of IDs inside the namespace that are to be mapped to an ID range of
the same length outside the namespace. The ID-outside-ns value
specifies the starting point of the outside range. How
ID-outside-ns is interpreted depends on the whether the process
opening the file /proc/*PID*/uid\_map
(or /proc/*PID*/gid\_map) is in the same user namespace
as the process *PID*:

* If the two processes are in the same namespace, then ID-outside-ns
  is interpreted as a user ID (group ID) in the parent user namespace of the
  process *PID*. The common case here is that a process is writing to
  its own mapping file (/proc/self/uid\_map or
  /proc/self/gid\_map).

* If the two processes are in different namespaces, then
  ID-outside-ns is interpreted as a user ID (group ID) in the user
  namespace of the process opening /proc/*PID*/uid\_map
  (/proc/*PID*/gid\_map). The writing process is then
  defining the mapping relative to its own user namespace.

Suppose that we once more invoke our demo\_userns program, but
this time with a single command-line argument (any string). This causes
the program to loop, continuously displaying credentials and capabilities
every few seconds:
```

    $ ./demo_userns x
    eUID = 65534;  eGID = 65534;  capabilities: =ep
    eUID = 65534;  eGID = 65534;  capabilities: =ep

```

Now we switch to another terminal windowâto a shell process
running in another namespace (namely, the parent user namespace of the
process running demo\_userns) and create a user ID mapping for the
child process in the new user namespace created by demo\_userns:
```

    $ ps -C demo_userns -o 'pid uid comm'      # Determine PID of clone child
      PID   UID COMMAND
     4712  1000 demo_userns                    # This is the parent
     4713  1000 demo_userns                    # Child in a new user namespace
    $ echo '0 1000 1' > /proc/4713/uid_map

```

If we return to the window running demo\_userns, we now see:
```

    eUID = 0;  eGID = 65534;  capabilities: =ep

```

In other words, the user ID 1000 in the parent user namespace (which
was formerly mapped to 65534) has been
mapped to user ID 0 in the user namespace created by demo\_userns.
From this point, all operations within the new user namespace that deal
with this user ID will see the number 0, while corresponding operations in
the parent user namespace will see the same process as having user ID 1000.

We can likewise create a mapping for group IDs in the new user
namespace. Switching to another terminal window, we create a mapping for
the single group ID 1000 in the parent user namespace to the group ID 0 in
the new user namespace:
```

    $ echo '0 1000 1' > /proc/4713/gid_map

```

Switching back to the window running demo\_userns, we see that
change reflected in the display of the effective group ID:
```

    eUID = 0;  eGID = 0;  capabilities: =ep

```
#### Rules for writing to mapping files

There are a number of rules governing writing to uid\_map
files; analogous rules apply for writing to gid\_map files. The
most important of these rules are as follows.

Defining a mapping is a one-time operation per namespace: we can perform only a
single write (that may contain multiple newline-delimited records) to a
uid\_map file of exactly one of the processes in the user
namespace. Furthermore, the number of lines that may be written to the file
is currently limited to five (an arbitrary limit that may be increased in
the future).

The /proc/*PID*/uid\_map file is owned by the user
ID that created the namespace, and is writeable only by that user (or a
privileged user). In addition, all of the following requirements must be
met:

* The writing process must have the CAP\_SETUID (CAP\_SETGID
  for gid\_map) capability in the user namespace of the process
  *PID*.

* Regardless of capabilities, the writing process must be in either the user
  namespace of the process *PID* or inside the (immediate) parent user namespace of
  the process *PID*.

* One of the following must be true:

+ The data written to uid\_map (gid\_map) consists of a
  single line that maps (only) the writing process's effective user ID (group ID) in the
  parent user namespace to a user ID (group ID) in the user namespace.
  This rule allows the initial process in a user namespace (i.e., the child
  created by clone()) to write a mapping for its
  own user ID (group ID).

+ The process has the CAP\_SETUID (CAP\_SETGID for
  gid\_map) capability in the parent user namespace. Such a process
  can define mappings to arbitrary user IDs (group IDs) in the parent user
  namespace. As we noted earlier, the initial process in a new user
  namespace has no capabilities in the parent namespace. Thus, only a process
  in the parent namespace can write a mapping that maps arbitrary IDs in the
  parent user namespace.

#### Capabilities, execve(), and user ID 0

In an earlier article in this series, we developed the [ns\_child\_exec](/Articles/533492/) program.
This program uses clone() to create a child process in new
namespaces specified by command-line options and then executes a shell
command in the child process.

Suppose that we use this program to execute a shell in a new user
namespace and then within that shell we try to define the user ID mapping for
the new user namespace. In doing so, we run into a problem:
```

    $ ./ns_child_exec -U  bash
    $ echo '0 1000 1' > /proc/$$/uid_map       # $$ is the PID of the shell
    bash: echo: write error: Operation not permitted

```

This error occurs because the shell has no capabilities inside the new user
namespace, as can be seen from the following commands:
```

    $ id -u         # Verify that user ID and group ID are not mapped
    65534
    $ id -g
    65534
    $ cat /proc/$$/status | egrep 'Cap(Inh|Prm|Eff)'
    CapInh: 0000000000000000
    CapPrm: 0000000000000000
    CapEff: 0000000000000000

```

The problem occurred at the execve() call that executed the
bash shell: when a process with non-zero user IDs performs an
execve(), the process's capability sets are cleared. (The [capabilities(7)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html)
manual page details the treatment of capabilities during an
execve().)

To avoid this problem, it is necessary to create a user ID mapping
inside the user namespace *before* performing the
execve(). This is not possible with the ns\_child\_exec
program; we need a slightly enhanced version of the program that does allow
this.

The [userns\_child\_exec.c](/Articles/539940/)
program performs the same task as the ns\_child\_exec program, and
has the same command-line interface, except that it allows two additional
command-line options, -M and -G. These options accept
string arguments that are used to define user and group ID maps for the new
user namespace. For example, the following command maps both user ID 1000
and group ID 1000 to 0 in the new user namespace:
```

    $ ./userns_child_exec -U -M '0 1000 1' -G '0 1000 1' bash

```

This time, updating the mapping files succeeds, and we see that the shell
has the expected user ID, group ID, and capabilities:
```

    $ id -u
    0
    $ id -g
    0
    $ cat /proc/$$/status | egrep 'Cap(Inh|Prm|Eff)'
    CapInh: 0000000000000000
    CapPrm: 0000001fffffffff
    CapEff: 0000001fffffffff

```

There are some subtleties to the implementation of the
userns\_child\_exec program. First, either the parent process
(i.e., the caller of clone()) or the new child process could
update the user ID and group ID maps of the new user namespace. However, following
the rules above, the only kind of mapping that the child process could
define would be one that maps just its own effective user ID. If we want to
define arbitrary user and group ID mappings in the child, then that must be done
by the parent process. Furthermore, the parent process must have suitable
capabilities, namely CAP\_SETUID, CAP\_SETGID, and (to ensure that
the parent has the permissions needed to open the mapping files)
CAP\_DAC\_OVERRIDE.

Furthermore, the parent must ensure that it updates the mapping files
before the child calls execve() (otherwise we have exactly the
problem described above, where the child will lose capabilities during the
execve()). To do this, the two processes employ a pipe to ensure
the required synchronization; comments in the program source code give full
details.
#### Viewing user and group ID mappings

The examples so far showed the use of
/proc/*PID*/uid\_map and
/proc/*PID*/gid\_map files for defining a
mapping. These files can also be used to view the mappings governing a
process. As when writing to these files, the second
(ID-outside-ns) value is interpreted according to which process is
opening the file. If the process opening the file is in the same user
namespace as the process *PID*, then ID-outside-ns is defined
with respect to the parent user namespace. If the process opening the file
is in a different user namespace, then ID-outside-ns is defined
with respect to the user namespace of the process opening the file.

We can illustrate this by creating a couple of user namespaces running
shells, and
examining the uid\_map files of the processes in the namespaces.
We begin by creating a new user namespace with a process running a shell:
```

    $ id -u            # Display effective user ID
    1000
    $ ./userns_child_exec -U -M '0 1000 1' -G '0 1000 1' bash
    $ echo $$          # Show shell's PID for later reference
    2465
    $ cat /proc/2465/uid_map
             0       1000          1
    $ id -u            # Mapping gives this process an effective user ID of 0
    0

```

Now suppose we switch to another terminal window and create a sibling
user namespace that employs different user and group ID mappings:
```

    $ ./userns_child_exec -U -M '200 1000 1' -G '200 1000 1' bash
    $ cat /proc/self/uid_map
           200       1000          1
    $ id -u            # Mapping gives this process an effective user ID of 200
    200
    $ echo $$          # Show shell's PID for later reference
    2535

```

Continuing in the second terminal window, which is running in the
second user namespace, we view the user ID mapping of the process in the other
user namespace:
```

    $ cat /proc/2465/uid_map
             0        200          1

```

The output of this command shows that user ID 0 in the other user
namespace maps to user ID 200 in this namespace. Note
that the same command produced different output when executed in the other
user namespace, because the kernel generates the ID-outside-ns
value according to the user namespace of the process that is reading from
the file.

If we switch back to the first terminal window, and display the user ID mapping
file for the process in the second user namespace, we see the converse
mapping:
```

    $ cat /proc/2535/uid_map
           200          0          1

```

Again, the output here is different from the same command when executed
in the second user namespace, because the ID-outside-ns value is
generated according to the user namespace of the process that is reading
from the file. Of course, in the initial namespace, user ID 0 in the first
namespace and user ID 200 in the second namespace both map to user ID
1000. We can verify this by executing the following commands in a third
shell window inside the initial user namespace:
```

    $ cat /proc/2465/uid_map
             0       1000          1
    $ cat /proc/2535/uid_map
           200       1000          1

```
#### Concluding remarks

In this article, we've looked at the basics of user namespaces: creating a
user namespace, using user and group ID map files, and the interaction of user
namespaces and capabilities.

As we noted in [an earlier article](/Articles/528078/), one
of the motivations for implementing user namespaces is to give non-root
applications access to functionality that was formerly limited to the root
user. In traditional UNIX systems, various pieces of functionality have
been limited to the root user in order to prevent unprivileged users from
manipulating the runtime environment of privileged programs, which could
affect the operation of those programs in unexpected or
undesirable ways.

A user namespace allows a process (that is unprivileged
outside the namespace) to have root privileges while at the same time
limiting the scope of that privilege to the namespace, with the result that
the process cannot manipulate the runtime environment of privileged
programs in the wider system. In order to use these root privileges
meaningfully, we need to combine user namespaces with other types of
namespacesâthat topic will form the subject of the next article in
this series.

@einstein: Parallels (virtuozzo/openvz authors) have been some of the primary contributors to the upstream namespace support in the kernel. While I cringe at seeing the 1Mb+ patch that openvz is, I've got to give them props for going about things the right (and very long) way of getting small bits upstream at a time.

Well, I am not quite sure where the 1 MB patch figure comes from, but all the RHEL 6.x based patches weigh in at 27 MB unpacked. Note that this is 2.6.32 vanilla -> RHEL 6.x+ovz, so I do assume that the vast majority of that diff is the RHEL 6.x changes. Either way, as you mentioned a massive amount of code from the people working for Parallels has been merged, so I would be curious what the RHEL 7.0 diff will look like. I guess we will know in a couple months.

Yeah, that was the first hit I got, too, but I discarded it for the reason listed below.

> So I still stand by my previous comment. Around a megabyte :)

Well, that specific patch is for a RHEL 5 based kernel, i.e. on top of their version of 2.6.18. The RHEL 6 based 2.6.32 kernel patch weights in at currently 1.3 MB (see [1]). And that patch dates from March 4th 2011, so I would hardly call it current :p.

Anyway, with ploop and some of their other bits being out of mainline for now their patch is a little like the RT patch set: growing some time and shrinking some other time, but as patches move into mainline from it new patches for new functionality get added on top. At least after many years of living mostly out of mainline their efforts like CRIU have shown that you can merge it into mainline assuming all interested parties collaborate, and that is a really positive development imho.

Oh I would say that the user namespaces at least are much closer to the original vserver approach (which uses a fixed number of the high bits as the container id) and fair bit better than either approach as all of the weird corner cases of mixing userspace uids and gids and the kernel uids and gids are handled.

That is what the remaining XFS work is about ensuring that XFS doesn't mix user space uids with in-kernel uids without adding the appropriate translations, and making it hard to mess confuse those two kinds of uids in the future. XFS has a very unique architecture for it's in-kernel filesystem data structures and many more user facing ioctls than most filesystems which means it can't be treated like just another filesystem.

What was not mentioned is that when a process in a user namespace interacts files, the interaction is the same as interacting with processes. When a file is created the uid of the process is mapped into the initial user namespace those mapped uids are stored on disk. Meanwhile when the process in a user namespace stats those files the uids are mapped back into it's namespace so it sees the uids it wrote with instead of the uids that are stored on disk.

This allows quotas and other filesystem features to work with user namespaces without any changes to the on-disk format.

Unix user/group management has always looked very complex to me, I wonder if this is because

1) I've not invested enough effort understand Unix management

2) the problem is itself very complex

3) this is an historical baggage/legacy and other approaches (Plan9? Windows?) could provide the same type of services but in a simpler way..

The old Unix permissions system actually isn't very complex, which is its central problem. The permissions are very coarse, and it's very hard to describe complex security arrangements using those very dull tools. It's primarily based on user/group/other, read/write/execute, and the various permutations of those three permissions, granted to those three broad categories. And then you've got system-wide capabilities, which either grant or deny access to users to do things that can be dangerous to the system as a whole. As they presently stand, Unix permissions are very coarsely defined, and can be very far-reaching. Granting a given permission to a program can have nasty security implications that are difficult to understand.

On the Windows side, NT-derivative systems have used ACLs for a long time, and they're much more capable. The permissions themselves are fairly fine-grained, and then you can specify to a gnat's eyebrow exactly who should and should not get them. As long as you realize that the permissions system is looking for any possible excuse to deny a permission, and only if it A) can't find any reason to reject someone, and B) finds an explicit authorization, will it finally grant a permission. Just think of the NT permissions system as a big asshole, and the whole system ends up being easily understandable, and very powerful.

But, ACLs have a very fundamental problem: permissions are granted, normally, to *users*, not *programs*, so they do almost nothing to protect programs from each other. If they're being run by the same user (say, "malor"), then they can mess each other up. If I'm running Internet Explorer, then it has any permission that I do, and if it's hijacked, it can erase or corrupt anything that I could erase or corrupt.

Namespaces are kind of an ugly hack that seem to have three basic goals:

1. Preserve compability with the old Unix blunt instruments;
2. Allow finer-grained permission controls;
3. Assign permissions based on programs, rather than users

Once this stuff has been really integrated into the system software, running Firefox as "malor" should grant a very limited exposure to my other files, should it be hijacked. The browser process might be restricted to creating new files in a download directory only, with no other write access anywhere in the filesystem. A separate, user-facing program might have the authorization to rewrite user configuration files, like bookmarks or the settings in about:config. By separating them in this way, it will be enormously harder for a remote exploit, even in a full-featured language like Java, to escape the virtual sandbox it's in. It probably won't be impossible, but it should be much more difficult, perhaps requiring a specific exploit be written to attack your particular combination of OS and Firefox, making it non-feasible for mass exploit attempts.

This is kind of the same thing that Microsoft and Apple are trying to do with their DRM-based software stores, and highly restricted environments, but in this case, YOU hold the keys, not Microsoft or Apple.

The overall solution ends up being kind of ugly, because of the simultaneous need to maintain compatibility with a 40-year-old permissions system, and also to implement a bunch of new permission types that have never existed in Unix before, but I'll tell you this: I'll take an ugly system I can control myself over an imposed system by a corporation any day. If I want the best security, where programs are isolated from one another, but I also want to own my own hardware, Linux namespaces seem to be the way forward.

> permissions are granted, normally, to users, not programs

Maybe that is not complex enough, and permissions should be granted to what the program is doing:

- if the program is updating itself (when no package manager) it should have rights to overwrite its own binaries

- if the program is configuring itself (when user changes something) it should have rights to change its configuration files

- if the program is being only "used", it shall do none of the above.

Ever seen a security system blocking half of the upgrade of a package?

I did not say I would like to manage such a system...

> NT-derivative systems have used ACLs for a long time, and they're much more capable.

And this is not \*necessarily\* a good thing. Taking Unix permissions and then adding capabilities and ACLs triples (more than triples, really) the logic required to statically verify a configuration. I guess I sort of appreciate the idea that a library that isn't there can't be misconfigured -- I don't run ACLs or CAP\_\*s or namespaces on my production Linux servers for that reason even though that takes rebuilding the kernel. It's the same argument I have with mandatory access control systems: knobs I can twist are knobs that I can twist the wrong way. I want my security system to be so brain-dead that I can verify it at 3am in a loud server room with a client calling me every 30 seconds.

Wasn't that one of the motivations for the microkernel design of GNU Hurd?

So, a UID in the parent namespace that isn't mapped in the child namespace is mapped to a default UID; but what about a UID in the child namespace that isn't mapped - what UID will that have in the parent namespace (for example, a process in the child namespace with UID=0 uses seteuid(9999) where child namespace UID 9999 isn't included in any mapping.

I've yet to delve into the kernel source to find where EINVAL is coming from, but can anyone see if I am missing something obvious? Or maybe it's because Ubuntu's done something magic to their kernel? (The Makefile in their Linux sources purports to be 3.8.2).

Okay, having dug deeper, it turns out that the examples require CONFIG\_USER\_NS. As the article points out, 3.8 was still missing the changes for XFS and other filesystems. Unsurprisingly, Ubuntu 13.04 chose XFS and NFSÂ support over CONFIG\_USER\_NS. Bummer :P

Note that because of the [Linux 3.19 changes that fixed a user namespace security loophole](http://lwn.net/Articles/626665/) related to the setgroups() system call, the userns\_child\_exec.c program needs modifications in order to be able to use GID maps on Linux 3.19 and later (and also on earlier stable kernel series that backported the changes). A revised (and backward compatible) version of this program with the necessary changes can be found in the revised [user\_namespaces(7)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/user_namespaces.7.html#EXAMPLE) man page that will appear in a few days time. (Look for the definition and use of the proc\_setgroup\_write() function in the example program.)

This is impressive but a bit hard to follow for a noob like me.

I think these are the main points of the articles:

When a user namespace is created by clone, the first cloned process in the new namespace is granted a full set of capabilities in the new namespace.

Invoking exec\* functions changes the calling process capabilities following the rules for the transformation of capabilities during exec\*:

1) pI' = pI

2) pP' = (X & fP) | (pI & fI)

3) pE' = fE & pP'

Hence the code ns\_child\_exec gets the permission error because the child shell in the new userspace is executed as an unprivileged user and the permitted and effective/ inheritable flags weren't set on appropriately.

The code userns\_child\_exec.c takes care of writing the root map for the new userspace from the parent.

Firstly it creates the new userspace by mean of clone, then it ensures the map files is written by the father process before the cloned child launches the shell using a pipe for interprocess communication: the pipe is duplicated when the process clones, so each process (father and child) will have their own copies of two file descriptors (pipe\_fd[0] for reading, pipe\_fd[1] for writing) pointing to the same pipe. The father exploits the write endpoint of the pipe closing the write channel when it completed the user mapping. The cloned child closes his write endpoint and exploits the read endpoint (it reads a character on the pipe expecting to be NULL - eof) to sync with the father ensuring the map was written by the calling process in the context of the father namespace before the shell execution.

These are my considerations:

In order to write on the mapping file from an unprivileged user (in the context of the parent namespace) the capabilities CAP\_SETUID, CAP\_SETGID needs to be granted to the calling process (see the first rule in the section Rules for writing to mapping files). The author doesn't show how to grant these privileges, a way is enabling the effective and permitted flags on the userns\_child\_exec binary.

Moreover I don't get why the writing of the mapping isn't accomplished in the childFunc which has full set of capabilities in the context of the new namespace before executing the shell (following the first point of the third rules in the section Rules for writing to mapping files this should be feasible), this would avoid the need of a sync mechanism.

The author states that to avoid losing the capabilities the parent needs to change the user mapping before executing the shell (since the shell capabilities flags aren't set appropriately for the exec transformation).

Anyway I think that if this sync check wasn't accomplished the shell might execute with an unpriviledged uid /proc/sys/kernel/overflowuid until the parent will be able to write the mapping. The sync is necessary to avoid race condition during the shell execution and to ensure the shell is running as a privileged process in the new userspace from the very beginning.

Since the command userns\_child\_exec takes the user mappings as argument, mappings to arbitrary user IDs (group IDs) in the parent user namespace must be allowed (see the second point of third rule in the section Rules for writing to mapping files).

Conversely, if the mapping is made from the cloned child in the new namespace, it's only possible to map the user id of the parent process in the parent namespace to any uid in the new namespace, root included.

When a process clones itself the user and group ids in the parent namespace are inherited by the child.

Other rules control the capabilities propagation between namespaces with a parental relationship, from the successive article <https://lwn.net/Articles/540087/>

"When a user namespace is created, the kernel records the effective user ID of the creating process as being the "owner" of the namespace. A process whose effective user ID matches that of the owner of a user namespace and which is a member of the parent namespace has all capabilities in the namespace."

So the required capabilities cap\_set{uid,gid} are granted to the unprivileged parent process on the new namespace by default.

Thanks for the article, it is really nice to read and follow.

I'm having an issue when trying to reproduce part of the mentioned steps (which should all be doable as non-root, as far as I understood).

In particular, when running `./demo\_userns x`, I \*can\* run `echo '0 1000 1' > /proc/$DEMO\_PID/uid\_map` successfully (and the output of thee demo\_userns program is updated with the new user id, 0), but I \*cannot\* run `echo '0 1000 1' > /proc/$DEMO\_PID/gid\_map`.

If I try to run those echo commands as root, they both work, but this sounds a bit against the purpose of this article (which is about being able to do root actions in a restricted environment -- the new user namespace).

If I proceed with the demo, I have a similar problem when I run `./userns\_child\_exec -U -M '0 1000 1' -G '0 1000 1' bash`:

```

write /proc/10568/gid\_map: Operation not permitted

bash: initialize\_job\_control: no job control in background: Bad file descriptor

```

Removing the -G part makes the error go away here as well.

Any clue on how I can debug this? As far as I understood, if a process is the parent user namespace it should automatically have the necessary capabilities (cap\_set\_uid, cap\_set\_gid) to write to the uid\_map / gid\_map files of the process in the new user namespace.

Is there anything that I can check to validate this? If I run `cat /proc/$$/status | grep Cap`, I get:

```

CapInh: 0000000000000000

CapPrm: 0000000000000000

CapEff: 0000000000000000

CapBnd: 0000003fffffffff

CapAmb: 0000000000000000

```

which I'm not sure how to interpret.

In particular, I'm referring to the three rules defined under `Rules for writing to mapping files`: the first one should always hold (based on my understanding, CAP\_SETUID/CAP\_SETGID are always valid for processes in the parent user namespace), the second one seems to hold as well (the spawned terminal is indeed in the user namespace of the shell that run `./demo\_userns x`), the third one seems a bit more ambiguous: the first statement holds (that's basically defined via `0 1000 1`), the second one not really (according the to the `cat /proc/$$/status | grep Cap` output) --> but to me it looks like only one of the two has to hold. Furthermore, if this is the problem, I would expect that writing to the uid\_map would lead to the same error.
