Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-18955:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in how the Linux kernel handles the mapping of user and group IDs within nested user namespaces when there are more than 5 UID or GID ranges. Specifically, the kernel correctly transforms IDs when going from the namespaced to the kernel, but fails to perform the inverse transformation (kernel to namespaced IDs) for the reverse mapping array. This leads to inconsistencies in ID mapping when more than the base number of extents is used in nested user namespaces.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Incorrect ID Translation:** The kernel performs the ID transformation correctly when mapping from a namespaced ID to a kernel ID, but not when mapping a kernel ID to a namespaced ID, in nested user namespaces with more than 5 UID/GID ranges.
- **Bypass of Access Controls:** This incorrect ID translation allows a local attacker to bypass access controls on resources outside the user namespace because access checks like `inode_owner_or_capable()` and `privileged_wrt_inode_uidgid()` rely on correct kernel-to-namespaced ID translations.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker with `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capabilities within a nested user namespace can bypass access controls outside the namespace.
- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information outside the user namespace. This is demonstrated by the ability to read `/etc/shadow`.
- **Data Modification:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to addition or modification of data.
- **Denial of Service:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to Denial of Service (DoS).

**Attack vectors:**

- **Local Attack:** The attack is local, meaning the attacker needs to have some form of access to the system.
- **Nested User Namespaces:** The vulnerability is triggered in nested user namespaces when more than 5 UID/GID ranges are used for mapping.
- **Capabilities:** The attacker requires `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability within a user namespace to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the target system.
- **CAP_SYS_ADMIN:** The attacker must be able to create and have `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` inside a user namespace.
- **Nested User Namespaces:** The attacker needs to create nested user namespaces.
- **More than 5 UID/GID Ranges:** The attacker needs to create more than 5 UID or GID mappings inside the nested user namespaces.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerability affects Linux kernel versions 4.15.x through 4.19.x before 4.19.2.
*   The bug was introduced with commit `6397fac4915a` ("userns: bump idmap limits to 340"), which increased the number of allowed uid/gid mappings, and was fixed by commit `d2f007dbe7e4c9583eea6eb04d60001e85c6f1bd` which fixed the idmap translation logic.
*   The vulnerability is present because the kernel does not correctly perform a "kernel-to-namespaced direction" ID transformation for reverse mappings in nested user namespaces with more than 5 extents.
*   A patch was created to address the vulnerability by making sure the "lower_first" members of extents are translated in both forward and reverse maps and ensuring that the reverse map is sorted after the translation.
*   Exploit code exists that demonstrates the ability to escalate privileges and read `/etc/shadow` by leveraging this vulnerability, specifically using the `newuidmap` and `newgidmap` utilities.
