  "CVE-2018-18309": {
    "description": "An invalid memory address dereference was discovered in read_reloc in reloc.c in GNU Binutils. The vulnerability causes a segmentation fault and application crash, leading to denial of service, as demonstrated by objdump, because of missing _bfd_clear_contents bounds checking.",
    "affected_components": [
      "libbfd",
        "objdump"
    ],
    "root_cause": "Missing bounds checking in _bfd_clear_contents when applying relocations to debug sections. A crafted PE file with a bad relocation in .debug_line triggers the vulnerability.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Invalid memory address dereference"
    ],
     "impact": "Denial of service, leading to application crash via segmentation fault.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Processing a crafted ELF or PE file with objdump."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to trick a user or automated system into processing a specially crafted ELF or PE file.",
      "additional_info": "The vulnerability is triggered by objdump and is caused due to the linker applying relocations from discarded sections using _bfd_clear_contents without checking that the relocation is within section bounds. The fix involves adding bounds checking within the _bfd_clear_contents function in reloc.c. SUSE has marked this as a developer tool issue, and update only when a stable version is available, recommends using a isolated system if processing untrusted code. SUSE has assigned a low severity rating due to the nature of the exploitation."
