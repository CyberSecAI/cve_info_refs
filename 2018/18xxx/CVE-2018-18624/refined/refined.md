Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-18624:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an incomplete fix for a previous XSS issue (CVE-2018-12099) in Grafana.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Improper sanitization/encoding of user-supplied input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability could lead to:
    - Disclosure of sensitive information.
    - Addition or modification of data.
    - Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
    - Potential hijacking of user sessions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is located in the "Dashboard > Table Panel" screen of Grafana.
- The attack vector involves setting a malicious URL within a column style's "Render value as link" option.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any privileges and must craft malicious links within the Grafana table panel configuration.
- User interaction (victim clicking the crafted link) is required for exploitation.
- The attacker needs network access to the Grafana instance.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript into the URL field of a table panel's column style.
- When a user interacts with the crafted link (e.g., by clicking on it), the injected JavaScript code is executed within the user's browser.

**Specific locations where the XSS can be injected:**
- Dashboard -> General -> Drilldown/detail link -> Title
- Dashboard -> Links -> Tooltip
- Dashboard > Add Panel > Table Panel > Set Column Styles > Check Render value as link > set Url
- The vulnerability also exists when setting the url to javascript:alert('XSS')
