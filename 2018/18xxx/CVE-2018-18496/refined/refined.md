Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-18496:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability to embed the `about:feeds` page within another page. This allows an attacker to use clickjacking techniques in conjunction with the feed preview functionality to trick users into downloading and executing an arbitrary executable file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Clickjacking:** The primary weakness is the ability to frame the `about:feeds` page, enabling a clickjacking attack.
- **Unrestricted File Download:** The file picker within the feed reader allows an attacker to input a URL, which results in the download of a remote file to a temporary folder without proper validation.
- **Arbitrary Execution:** Upon selecting a custom application to handle the feed, the downloaded file in the temporary directory will be executed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE). By embedding the vulnerable page and using a clickjacking overlay, the attacker can trick a user into executing a malicious file.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Embedding:** An attacker embeds the `about:feeds` page within a malicious web page.
- **Clickjacking:** The attacker overlays the embedded `about:feeds` with deceptive content.
- **File Picker Manipulation:** The attacker uses JavaScript to copy a malicious URL to the clipboard. The user is then tricked into pasting this URL into the file picker of the feed reader.
- **Download and Execution:** The file picker downloads the malicious file from the attacker's server and then the user is tricked into executing it by subscribing to the feed using the downloaded file as a custom app.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to host a malicious web page containing the clickjacking attack.
- The attacker needs to host a malicious executable file, accessible via HTTP/HTTPS.
- The attacker needs to trick the user into interacting with the clickjacking overlay.
- The attacker needs to trick the user into pasting a URL into the file picker.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability is specific to Windows operating systems, due to the way file pickers handle URLs. Other OSes are not affected.
- The issue was mitigated by preventing `about:feeds` from being framed, but the underlying functionality that allows for downloading and execution of a file through the file picker is still present.
- The severity was initially deemed moderate due to the high user interaction required, however the end result is RCE, increasing the severity.
- A bypass for windows' mark of the web warning could be achieved by downloading a jar file which would be executed automatically.
