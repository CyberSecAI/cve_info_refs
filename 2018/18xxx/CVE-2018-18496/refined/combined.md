Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Attached file
[feedrce.html](attachment.cgi?id=8933553)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8933553&action=edit)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/62.0.3202.94 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
Tested on latest Nightly v59.0a1 (2017-11-30) (64-bit)
Using PoC attached:
1. Click on first button from the top, this will copy our malicious executable (in this case its my own hosted batch file that simply opens calc)
2. Click on the second button, you should see a drop down menu appear, here you choose the 'Choose Application..' option.
3. After a file picker appears, simply paste the URL copied in step1 and hit 'open'
4. Finally, click the last button.
Actual results:
Firefox has its own preview feed reader for files with the type "application/vnd.mozilla.maybe.feed". Within it, a user could choose a custom application to subscriber to the feed you're viewing.
When choosing a custom app, a filepicker appears which we can feed an http url into it and after clicking 'open' the remote file will be downloaded into a local temporary folder. Finally, if the user clicks on the 'subscribe' button, the downloaded file will be executed.
In the PoC, we embed the feed preview in order to clickjack a potential victim into executing attacker executable file.
These files have mark of the web and so an initial 'unknown publisher' dialog warning does appear. Though we can bypass this by having a .jar file downloaded instead. Although its good that windows' mark of the web warnings appear for most executables, its not far fetched to bypass this with either a stolen cert or some bug in windows.
Expected results:
One or more of the following:
1. Disable feed preview on embedded feed files (or at least the part that allows custom apps).
2. Prevent file picker from downloading remote files (though this may be a windows unique problem)
3. Add whitelist of directories allowed to contain custom feed reader apps. (or blacklist temp web download folder)
Admittedly this requires high user interaction but keep in mind this highlights a bigger problem, that is that the feed previewer could be used for download&exec exploits. This can turn a uXSS into a full RCE. (I'm assuming here that if one can execute JS within feed preview pages, they could use it to 'fake' a custom app subscription which is essentially download&exec as described here)

Hmm interesting. So when you enter a http: url into a file input field in the windows file picker, it downloads the file to a temp directory, and then returns the temp file the chooser. That I didn't know.
There rest here is pretty much as expected; the feed application chooser floats above content to try to protect against this sort of attack. This is a somewhat convincing attack
From Firefox's perspective, you are choosing an application on disk, that happens to be in the \appData\ directory. You can observe this by looking at about:config, and search for the browser.feeds.handlers.application preference. After I followed your instructions, I ended up with the "application" as:
C:\Users\<redacted>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\INetCache\IE\<redacted>\a[1].bat
So can we do anything about this? I'm not sure. We could make about:feeds not allowed to be framed or embedded. But there are probably reasons it can be embeded, so you suggest we could remove the control perhaps. I'm included just to prevent framing. as that seems like an odd use case, and not worth the risk here. The windows thing I dont think we can do much. We \_could\_ blacklist the INetCache dir, but that seems a bit of a weak control.
As for the question of XSS into RCE, you are not able to access the feedreader page with webpage scripts (the feed reader is located at about:feeds which is cross-origin to the embedding webpage). Or are least you \_shouldn't\_ be able to you. If you manage to achieve that, this would be a separate bug in its own right.
CC'ing a few people who might have some thoughts here. I don't think this is probably only sec-moderate at worst, maybe even this is only sec-low. Bottom line is that if you can convince a user to paste a string into a box pretty powerful things on windows :/
PS FWIW Windows Smart Screen actually prevented execution of the bat file, but I wouldn't trust that.Keywords: [sec-moderate](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-moderate&resolution=---)

— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8933575&action=edit)

Although we can do more harmful things (with less user interaction) on windows if a user is willing to copy paste things for us, I think its important to distinguish flaws with windows OS and firefox. 90% of this bug happens within firefox and I imagine firefox users trust web pages not to execute arbitrary code no matter what interaction happens \_within web document\_.
I can see this being sec-low except for the bypasses I mentioned. I think the fact that the end result is RCE the high user interaction could be forgiven :)
PoC video of another method that attempts to trick potential victim into clicking 'run' on the windows 'mark of the web' warning. Also please keep in mind we can automatically execute JAR files and completely circumvent the mark of the web warning prompt which adds somewhat to the severity.

This was optimized for my screen resolution so it may not work as smoothly as it does on my PoC video.

Yeah, we should prevent framing. We already try this a little bit, but we should clearly try harder. This has come up before.
We're also considering just removing the feed reader entirely, but that depends on some telemetry etc. (cf. [bug 1350349](/show_bug.cgi?id=1350349 "RESOLVED FIXED - Add telemetry to discover usage of feed reader preview"))

I assume this won't be a compat issue here? This seems like a good idea to me.
> This is a somewhat convincing attack
Yeah I thought we didn't permit embedding here.
> Finally, if the user clicks on the 'subscribe' button, the downloaded file will be executed.
Yeah given that you can allow Firefox to execute any application through feed reader this kind of attack makes it super worrying that worse would be possible.
Even if this is a sec-low, this concerns me enough that it should stay moderate.

I tried to find information about this but I was unable to find anything to suggest this is possible in the relevant windows docs. Did I just miss it? Jim, do you know?
(for context: apparently in windows' "open file" dialogs, you can paste a http/https (maybe ftp?) URL in the file name box, and hit OK, and Windows will conveniently download said file into somewhere in %TEMP% and then pass the calling app a ref to the downloaded file. I think we should disable this functionality in Firefox if we can, but I'm not sure it's possible)

Longer-ish-term (possibly Firefox 61/62, likely not 60 though we might add an about:config pref for it), we are looking at removing feed preview support entirely. So not sure (3) is worth it.Flags: needinfo?(jmathies)

Can we just not pre-populate the file picker? I'm not aware of a way to turn this off.Flags: needinfo?(jmathies)

We don't, the PoC depends on the user pasting the URL after copying it to the clipboard using JS APIs.

The clickjacking aspect of the original PoC has been fixed by [bug 1445106](/show_bug.cgi?id=1445106 "RESOLVED FIXED - Prevent feed reader from being framed"), this renders the bug much less severe as the only way to exploit it now is if you somehow convince a user to visibly add an application and copy paste a url in the feed reader preview page.

Looks like this is fixed, seems like the feed reader has been removed (?) rendering this bug fixed. Tested on 64.0b3 and 65.0a1.
May I get a bounty tag added for consideration? (not sure if I can just do it myself)

Ah, that's my bad. I was confused from a recent exchange I had with security@.
@dveditz: I can still send that email if need be. Please let me know.
Sorry!

I have reproduced this bug using the test case from [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1422231#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - RCE potential by abusing embedded feed preview + click jacking"), on an affected Nightly build (2017-11-30).
I can confirm that the button "Click here second", doesn't trigger anymore the app, in order to run the exploit. Tested on latest Nightly 65.0a1 and Beta 64.0b11 under Windows 10 x64.Status: RESOLVED → VERIFIED

— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8939358&action=edit)

I noticed an unusual permission warning when first visiting about: pages with an extension installed.
> Error: Permission denied to access property "defaultOptions" defaults.js:1:1
By looking at the loaded moz-extension:// sources in Browser Toolbox I noticed that content scripts were being loaded as background scripts on visiting an about: page. It only happens with manifests that have both "match\_about\_blank" and "run\_at" "document\_start". "matches" does not seem to make any difference. The about: page must be visited for the first time in that window and it does not happen with about:blank.
I modified the manifest of the Borderify example extension and attached it as a test case.
STR:
1. Install modified Borderify extension.
2. Open Browser Toolbox, go to Debugger and note moz-extension:// list of sources.
3. Create a new window and visit about:about.
4. Note borderify.js in list of moz-extension:// sources despite it being a content script.
I'm unsure of security implications so marking this as hidden just in case.

Can you explain what you mean by "loaded as background scripts"? If this is just about how the scripts appear in devtools, this should be moved to a devtools component and made public, its not clear to me if you're reporting something else however...Flags: needinfo?(kestrel)

[match\_about\_blank\_test-1.0.zip](attachment.cgi?id=8940499)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8940499&action=edit)

The content script is being loaded in about:blank before the destination about: page is loaded, if the destination is in the main process then the script is also loaded in the main process. This can be observed by putting an infinite loop in the script and monitoring which process shows high CPU usage. Content scripts being loaded in to the main process undermines process sandboxing and the script can interfere with the loading of important about: pages, delaying or redirecting them.
The script still appears to be sandboxed as a content script, limited to WE APIs and CSP is not blocking eval(). It remains in the main process after uninstallation so restarting the browser is usually required between tests.
Attempting to breakpoint the script causes a crash:
> MOZ\_RELEASE\_ASSERT(js::SavedFrame::isSavedFrameOrWrapperAndNotProto(\*stack))
Accessing a variable in another script file produces a permission error (it doesn't happen with very small script files, I had to pad the script with text for this to appear).
> Error: Permission denied to access property "defaultOption" defaults.js:1:1
If it contains browser.storage.onChanged.addListener it produces an error for about:blank pages regardless of which process it gets loaded into:
> Error: WebExtension context not found! ExtensionParent.jsm:863:13
Attached is an example extension demonstrating the above errors.

I think in general we want to stop loading content pages in the parent process, but until that's true, we can probably do something locally for content scripts.
Hopefully this doesn't impact system addons, though I'm afraid one of PDF.js or reader view is still in the parent process.Assignee: nobody → tomica

IMO this bug doesn't look like sec-crit or sec-high, and Kris agrees.
Given that, I will probably want to push a patch for this to Try, to suss out all the possible corner cases this change might break. Obviously, I'll find or file an innocent looking bug to disguise as.
Let me know if anyone disagrees or objects.

Call it a low "sec-moderate" because it's violating our sandbox policies, but for bad things to happen the user has installed a malicious extension (that can already do bad data-stealing things to the user) and the WE has to have an RCE exploit. If that happens then this is a sandbox bypass.Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)Keywords: [sec-moderate](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-moderate&resolution=---)

So there are better ways to do this, but they require more intrusive changes (probably across c++ and js), and would be harder to make look innocuous in a public bug. We can land a better patch after this goes through release/ESR.
Also, I have manually verified this fixes the problem, but can't think of any way to write a test for it. :/

Resolving, this was fixed in [bug 1496532](/show_bug.cgi?id=1496532 "RESOLVED FIXED - Content script sometimes runs in pre-allocated new tab page") (and followup [bug 1498311](/show_bug.cgi?id=1498311 "RESOLVED FIXED - Fix extension isContentScriptProcess logic for platforms without oop extensions")).
Hey Ryan, I don't think we we're uplifting "low sec-moderate" to ESR, right? Anyway, this fix wouldn't even apply across all platforms since we only had OOP extensions on Windows in Firefox 60.
Also, we probably want to QA to verify this (they already asked in the public bugs).Flags: qe-verify?Flags: needinfo?(ryanvm)

We have some leeway for taking sec-moderate patches on ESR60 (note that ESR52 is already EOL, so we wouldn't be looking at any older releases), largely a matter of balancing the severity of the bug, the riskiness of the patch, and the long-term cost of leaving it unfixed on that branch (since ESR60 isn't EOL for roughly another year).
If in doubt, I'd run it past dveditz and see what he thinks. Thanks for the ping!Group: toolkit-core-security → core-security-release

Verified as fixed using Firefox 64(buildid 20181105164654) on Winsows 10x64 and macOS 10.13.6.
I also confirmed that issue was reproducible on earlier FF versions.Status: RESOLVED → VERIFIED

Thanks Victor!
Daniel, would you insist in uplifting this to ESR? I don't recommend it because:
1) it's low sec-moderate,
2) this fix is only possible on Windows for ESR (we didn't have OOP extensions on other platforms in 60),
2) and it's likely to break something unknown / that doesn't live in m-c / something enterprises might be doing.
This is generally a major change for some corner cases, and IMO somewhat risky, which is why I originally opted to do it in a public [bug 1496532](/show_bug.cgi?id=1496532 "RESOLVED FIXED - Content script sometimes runs in pre-allocated new tab page") (and it did evidently break on unexpected stuff even in m-c).Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)

Thanks for asking -- those are all good reasons not to take this fix on ESR.

| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |
