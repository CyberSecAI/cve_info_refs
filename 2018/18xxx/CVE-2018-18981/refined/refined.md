- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Heap-based buffer overflow
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow. Sending numerous crafted packets to service ports can lead to memory consumption and a denial-of-service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could lead to a partial or complete denial-of-service to the affected services.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote, unauthenticated attacker can send crafted packets to service ports.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the affected service ports. No authentication is required and the skill level required is low.
