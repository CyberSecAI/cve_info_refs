Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-18982:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command, specifically within the alarm querying functionality of the NUUO Central Management Server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application allows the injection of arbitrary SQL characters, which can be used to manipulate the SQL query and execute arbitrary SQL commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  By injecting malicious SQL code, an attacker can enable `xp_cmdshell` (a SQL Server extended stored procedure that allows executing operating system commands). This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of the server, leading to a full system compromise.
*   **Data Modification/Disclosure:** Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, SQL injection vulnerabilities can also be leveraged to modify or exfiltrate sensitive data stored in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
*   **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the NUUO CMS server, specifically when querying alarm states.
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary attack vector is the injection of malicious SQL into the `SourceServer` parameter of the alarm query request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the NUUO CMS in order to exploit this vulnerability. They either need to have valid credentials or be able to obtain them (e.g., using default credentials).
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable NUUO CMS server.
*   **Low Skill Level:**  The exploit is characterized as having a low skill level to exploit.

**Additional Details from the Exploit-DB Content:**
*   The exploit module for Metasploit is available, which can automate the exploitation process.
*   The exploit leverages the default installation of SQL Server 2005 Express (which has `xp_cmdshell` disabled by default) by first enabling `xp_cmdshell`, then downloading a malicious executable (payload) and executing it on the target machine via PowerShell.
*   The exploit attempts to log in with a provided username and password or tries default credentials if none are provided.
*   The Metasploit module allows specifying the target server, the HTTP delay, and the URI path.

**Summary**
The vulnerability lies in the fact that the NUUO CMS doesn't properly sanitize user input used in the SQL query, specifically within the alarm querying functionality, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code. The attacker can gain remote code execution through enabling `xp_cmdshell`, downloading a payload, and executing it on the target. The exploitation can be done remotely by an authenticated user with network access.
