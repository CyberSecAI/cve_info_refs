Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `XstreamEngine` in `pippo-java/pippo` uses XStream to unmarshal XML data without proper validation of the types present in the XML. This allows for the deserialization of arbitrary types, including those that can lead to remote code execution (RCE).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure Deserialization:** The core vulnerability lies in the insecure deserialization of XML data using XStream.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The `XstreamEngine` does not check the types of objects present in the XML data before deserialization, making it vulnerable to malicious payloads.
- **Use of vulnerable library**: The application uses XStream which is known to be vulnerable to remote code execution when processing untrusted data, if not configured properly

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can craft a malicious XML payload containing specially crafted types that, when deserialized, will lead to arbitrary code execution on the server running the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- **XML data injection:** The attacker can inject the malicious XML data as the body of an HTTP request to the `/xml` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the `/xml` endpoint of the vulnerable application.
- The attacker must be able to craft a malicious XML payload that exploits the XStream deserialization vulnerability (using tools like marshalsec).
- No authentication or specific positioning within the network is explicitly specified as requirement for exploitation, implying that the vulnerability is exploitable from anywhere an attacker can reach the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is similar to the Struts2 S2-052 vulnerability.
- The issue was reported on September 28, 2018.
- The issue suggests a mitigation strategy based on XStream's APIs for controlling types to be unmarshalled, which were introduced since version 1.4.7 of XStream.
- The content includes a link to a sample malicious payload file and to the marshalsec tool for generating such payloads.
