{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application fails to properly validate the 'username' parameter in the HTTP GET request, allowing for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Lack of Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can steal the session cookie of a logged-in user, potentially gaining unauthorized access to their account.

    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload within the `username` parameter, then trick a user into clicking this malicious link or visiting a third-party website where the link has been placed.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL and to trick a user into interacting with it. They don't need any specific privileges on the target system or application. The user needs to be logged into the SemcoSoft application for the attack to have any impact."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The provided content gives an example of the HTTP request and response, detailing how the XSS vulnerability is triggered and how the malicious JavaScript is reflected back to the userâ€™s browser. It also includes a CVSSv3 base score of 5.5 with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N."
