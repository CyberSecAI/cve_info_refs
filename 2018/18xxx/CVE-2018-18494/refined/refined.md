    "description": "A same-origin policy violation allowing the theft of cross-origin URL entries when using the Javascript `location` property to cause a redirection to another site using `performance.getEntries()`. This is a same-origin policy violation and could allow for data theft.",
    "vulnerabilities": [

      "Cross-origin URL theft"
    ],
    "impact": "Data theft, arbitrary code execution (in some contexts).",

The browser incorrectly handles the permissions or origin check when using the location attribute, allowing cross-origin data leakage.",
    "additional_info": "This vulnerability exists in Firefox and Thunderbird. The security flaw can potentially allow for data theft by violating the same origin policy.\nSome browsers may mitigate by disabling specific parts of the API."
