Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-18930:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper handling of path separators within ZIP archive files uploaded to the Tightrope Media Systems Carousel application. Specifically, the application expected backslashes ("\\") as path separators within the ZIP file but didn't reject ZIP files that used forward slashes ("/").
*   The system discarded files with forward slashes as path separators during the import. By changing the forward slashes to backslashes in the ZIP file via hex editor, the system imported the files as intended.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** The system allows uploading of ZIP files for bulletin import.
*   **Path Traversal:** By manipulating the path separators in the ZIP archive, an attacker can upload files to arbitrary locations, given they know the full path.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading malicious ASPX files, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full System Compromise:** An attacker can gain remote code execution.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Indirectly):** While the initial exploit grants access to the web application's user context, the attacker can leverage this to elevate privileges.
*   **Data Breach/Manipulation:** With RCE, attackers can potentially access sensitive data and modify system configurations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface by uploading a specially crafted ZIP file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to the web interface:** An attacker needs to access the web interface of the Tightrope Media Systems Carousel.
*   **Ability to upload files:** The attacker must have permissions to upload files via the bulletin import functionality.
*   **Knowledge of ZIP File Format:** The attacker needs the ability to manipulate a ZIP archive, specifically understanding how to use a hex editor.
*   **Basic understanding of file system paths:** The attacker must identify and use the correct file paths to successfully execute their malicious files.

**Additional Details:**

*   The attacker used a hex editor to change the path separator in the ZIP file, allowing the server to process the uploaded files.
*   The attacker was able to upload a web shell (.aspx file), gain command execution, and then subsequently obtain a reverse shell by uploading and executing a PowerShell script
*   This allowed the attacker to run in the context of the restricted IIS AppPool account, then they found that the “NT Authority\Authenticated Users” group had “Modify” permissions to the service exe file (which was running as SYSTEM). The attacker then uploaded a malicious service exe to gain a local admin account.
*   The attacker eventually bypassed the firewall by using ngrok.
