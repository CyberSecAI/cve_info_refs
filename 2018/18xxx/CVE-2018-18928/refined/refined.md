The provided content is related to CVE-2018-18928.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Integer overflow during number parsing in ICU library when handling scientific notation with very large exponents.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability exists in how the `DecimalQuantity` class handles scientific notation, specifically when converting a very large negative exponent to a string. It can lead to an integer overflow. In `icu4c/source/i18n/number_decimalquantity.cpp` and `icu4j/main/classes/core/src/com/ibm/icu/impl/number/DecimalQuantity_AbstractBCD.java`, when the calculated scale (`_scale`) is equal to `INT32_MIN` or `Integer.MIN_VALUE` the code should avoid further arithmetic operation that could lead to an overflow, and directly output the string representation of the minimum integer value. The vulnerability is that prior to this fix, there was no check for `INT32_MIN` or `Integer.MIN_VALUE`.
Additionally, a scaleByPowerOfTen operation in the bcdToBigDecimal method could also cause an arithmetic exception.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The integer overflow could lead to incorrect number parsing, potentially causing unexpected behavior or crashes. While not detailed in the provided content, it is possible that such a vulnerability could be leveraged for other attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could provide a specially crafted input string to a component using the ICU library for number parsing. This string would include a number formatted in scientific notation with an extremely large negative exponent, which then causes the integer overflow during processing.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to be able to control the input to a function/component that uses ICU for number formatting/parsing, and provide a string representing a number with a very large negative exponent.
