Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-18016:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- A memory leak exists in the `WritePCXImage` function within the `coders/pcx.c` file of ImageMagick. Specifically, if memory allocation fails for `pcx_colormap`, the previously allocated memory for `page_table` is not freed, leading to a memory leak.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Memory Leak:** The primary vulnerability is a memory leak.  The code allocates memory for `page_table`, then later attempts to allocate `pcx_colormap`. If the allocation for `pcx_colormap` fails, the function exits without freeing the memory allocated to `page_table`.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to memory exhaustion. If an attacker repeatedly triggers this memory leak, it can exhaust available system memory, causing a denial-of-service condition by impacting performance and stability.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attack vector involves providing a specially crafted or malformed PCX image to ImageMagick for processing, specifically triggering the `WritePCXImage` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to provide an input image to ImageMagick.  This could be through a web service, command line tool, or any other way ImageMagick processes images.
- The attacker must be able to trigger the specific code path within `WritePCXImage` where the memory leak occurs.

**Additional details:**
- The issue was reported in ImageMagick versions up to 7.0.7-28.
- The vulnerability was fixed in ImageMagick versions 6.9.9-40 and 7.0.7-29 and later.
- The issue is triggered in the `WritePCXImage` function around lines 923 and 1001 of `coders/pcx.c`.
- The fix involves ensuring that the allocated memory for `page_table` is freed, even if the subsequent allocation for `pcx_colormap` fails.
