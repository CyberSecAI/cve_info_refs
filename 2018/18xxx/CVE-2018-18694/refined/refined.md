The provided content is related to CVE-2018-18694.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Monstra CMS file upload mechanism not properly handling files without extensions. The system checks for forbidden file extensions, but doesn't handle the case where there is no extension and allows the upload of such files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient file extension validation: The system only checks for forbidden extensions and not the absence of an extension.
- Unrestricted file upload: The system allows uploading files without extensions.
- Improper file handling: The system appends a '.' to the end of a file without an extension, which can still be interpreted as HTML by browsers if the file content is HTML.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): An attacker can upload a malicious HTML file without an extension, which is then executed in the victim's browser, leading to potential data theft or manipulation.

**Attack vectors:**
- File upload via the file manager interface, requiring admin credentials.
- Accessing the uploaded file either by clicking the filename in the file manager, or by directly navigating to the file's URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to the Monstra CMS admin interface.
- Ability to upload files through the file manager.
