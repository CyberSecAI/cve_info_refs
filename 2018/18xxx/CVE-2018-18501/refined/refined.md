Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-18501:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is memory safety bugs present in Firefox 64 and Firefox ESR 60.4 (and Thunderbird 60.4) due to incomplete or incorrect memory management.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the presence of memory corruption bugs. The content indicates that some of the bugs showed evidence of memory corruption, suggesting potential use-after-free, heap overflow, or other memory related issues.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these memory safety bugs could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the affected process. This is considered a critical impact, as it can lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves enticing a user to open a specially crafted website or an HTML5 stream.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need the ability to craft malicious web content and lure a victim into viewing it using Firefox or Thunderbird. The attacker would be exploiting vulnerabilities in the browser's or email client's handling of the malicious content.
