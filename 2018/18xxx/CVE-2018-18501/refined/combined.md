## Security vulnerabilities fixed in Thunderbird 60.5

Announced
January 29, 2019
Impact
critical
Products
Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Thunderbird 60.5

*In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

#### [#CVE-2018-18500: Use-after-free parsing HTML5 stream](#CVE-2018-18500)

Reporter
Yaniv Frank with SophosLabs
Impact
critical
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur while parsing an HTML5 stream in concert with custom HTML elements. This results in the stream parser object being freed while still in use, leading to a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1510114](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1510114)

#### [#CVE-2018-18505: Privilege escalation through IPC channel messages](#CVE-2018-18505)

Reporter
Jed Davis
Impact
high
##### Description

An earlier fix for an Inter-process Communication (IPC) vulnerability, CVE-2011-3079, added authentication to communication between IPC endpoints and server parents during IPC process creation. This authentication is insufficient for channels created after the IPC process is started, leading to the authentication not being correctly applied to later channels. This could allow for a sandbox escape through IPC channels due to lack of message validation in the listener process.

* [CVE-2011-3079](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1087565)

#### [#CVE-2018-18512: Use-after-free during sound notifications](#CVE-2018-18512)

Reporter
Wayne Mery
Impact
high
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur while playing a sound notification in Thunderbird. The memory storing the sound data is immediately freed, although the sound is still being played asynchronously, leading to a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1482659](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1482659)

#### [#CVE-2016-5824: DoS (use-after-free) via a crafted ics file](#CVE-2016-5824)

Reporter
Brandon Perry
Impact
low
##### Description

A vulnerability in the Libical libary used by Thunderbird can allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free) via a crafted ICS calendar file.

##### References

* [Bug 1275400](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1275400)

#### [#CVE-2018-18513: DOS and crash with crafted S/MIME message or XPI package](#CVE-2018-18513)

Reporter
Hanno Böck, Damian Poddebniak
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A crash can occur when processing a crafted S/MIME message or an XPI package containing a crafted signature. This can be used as a denial-of-service (DOS) attack because Thunderbird reopens the last seen message on restart, triggering the crash again.

##### References

* [Bug 1533300](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1533300)

#### [#CVE-2018-18501: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 65, Firefox ESR 60.5, and Thunderbird 60.5](#CVE-2018-18501)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Alex Gaynor, Christoph Diehl, Steven Crane, Jason Kratzer, Gary Kwong, and Christian Holler reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 64, Firefox ESR 60.4, and Thunderbird 60.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1122983#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2019-01-24 08:00:05 UTC  ``` planned release is January 29th ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1122983#c1)  Wolfgang Rosenauer   2019-01-24 08:24:11 UTC  ``` Currently the following updates are expected: - Firefox 65.0 for TW - Firefox 60.5.0 for 15.0 and 42.3 - Thunderbird for TW, 15.0, and 42.3 - NSS 3.36.7 for 42.3 - NSS 3.41.1 for 15.0 and TW  These NSS versions include minor fixes but so far I know without having CVE references yet they are affecting Firefox and also Thunderbird and for TB can cause DOS-type attacks.  I already prepared NSS updates for all targets either in mozilla:Factory or in home:wrosenauer:branches:OBS_Maintained:mozilla-nss. [https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home:wrosenauer:branches:OBS_Maintained:mozilla-nss](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home%3Awrosenauer%3Abranches%3AOBS_Maintained%3Amozilla-nss) But I'm unsure what to submit. The 15.0 NSS is imported from SLE15 (and btw was forked away from the Factory stream but this is another topic to discuss). In any case I do not even know if 15.0 should get 3.41.1 or a manually patched 3.40.1 (since there is no official patch level update for 3.40). Please indicate what I should submit in the end.  The other updates are WIP still. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1122983#c2)  Wolfgang Rosenauer   2019-01-29 22:29:41 UTC  ``` I've created submitrequests for all packages outlined above BUT mozilla-nss.  I need advice what and how to submit to openSUSE Leap as NSS is covered by SLE15. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1122983#c3)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-01-29 23:10:07 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1122983) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/669998> Factory / MozillaFirefox <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/669999> Factory / MozillaThunderbird <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/670000> 15.0 / MozillaThunderbird <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/670001> 42.3 / MozillaThunderbird ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1122983#c4)  Marcus Meissner   2019-01-30 06:43:15 UTC  ``` <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2019-02/>   Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2019-02 Security vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox ESR 60.5  Announced     January 29, 2019 Impact     critical Products     Firefox ESR Fixed in          Firefox ESR 60.5  #CVE-2018-18500: Use-after-free parsing HTML5 stream  Reporter     Yaniv Frank with SophosLabs Impact     critical  Description  A use-after-free vulnerability can occur while parsing an HTML5 stream in concert with custom HTML elements. This results in the stream parser object being freed while still in use, leading to a potentially exploitable crash. References      Bug 1510114  #CVE-2018-18505: Privilege escalation through IPC channel messages  Reporter     Jed Davis Impact     high  Description  An earlier fix for an Inter-process Communication (IPC) vulnerability, CVE-2011-3079, added authentication to communication between IPC endpoints and server parents during IPC process creation. This authentication is insufficient for channels created after the IPC process is started, leading to the authentication not being correctly applied to later channels. This could allow for a sandbox escape through IPC channels due to lack of message validation in the listener process.

This results in a potentially exploitable crash and the possibility of reading from the memory of the freed buffers.

This behavior is disallowed by default when a proxy is manually configured, but when enabled could allow for attacks on services and tools that bind to the localhost for networked behavior if they are accessed through browsing.

This results in the stream parser object being freed while still in use, leading to a potentially exploitable crash. References      Bug 1510114  #CVE-2018-18505: Privilege escalation through IPC channel messages  Reporter     Jed Davis Impact     high  Description  An earlier fix for an Inter-process Communication (IPC) vulnerability, CVE-2011-3079, added authentication to communication between IPC endpoints and server parents during IPC process creation. This authentication is insufficient for channels created after the IPC process is started, leading to the authentication not being correctly applied to later channels. This could allow for a sandbox escape through IPC channels due to lack of message validation in the listener process.

We have have probably inherited [CVE-2011-3079](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-3079) from our import of Chromium's IPC code 5½ years ago.
My understanding of this bug is: Chromium IPC endpoints have names, and knowing the name is sufficient to connect to it. These names were predictable and, on Windows, are reflected in the named pipe namespace which an untrusted process can traverse. The patch adds 32 bits of randomness to each name, and excludes that part from the pipe name on Windows. (Anyone with more knowledge of IPC is invited to correct this summary if needed.)
There's also a patch on the bug which seems to not be directly related to the IPC issue itself, and has something to do with Windows security levels: <https://crbug.com/117627#c18>
+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #958895](/show_bug.cgi?id=958895 "RESOLVED FIXED - [meta] Import upstream chromium security fixes into our IPC implementation") +++
"IPC Channel does not validate the listener."

Yes. The impact is privilege escalation from a compromised child process.

I started trying to see how hard this is to backport, and it's definitely not easy (even by the standards of hand-applied diffs set by the other children of [bug 958895](/show_bug.cgi?id=958895 "RESOLVED FIXED - [meta] Import upstream chromium security fixes into our IPC implementation")). IPC::Channel seems to have been nontrivially refactored between our fork and the upstream bug, at least for the Windows implementation, so I'm not even sure where some of the parts of the first patch should be applied without spending more time making sense of both copies. Other parts of it depend on parts of chromium/base that don't (or no longer) exist in our tree, so they'd have to be (re-)imported or replaced, but that's a more straightforward complication.

I've been in and around this code recently and looking at their patches, I've convinced myself as to how to backport this.
So, I'll pick this one up.

I've looked at the patches some more, and I think I agree — if I'm reading it correctly, the IPC hello message payload is just the pid on POSIX (and the fix here is to add a secret int for Windows only). It's a little confusing because of the references to “validated channels” and needing to generate random names even in the POSIX case. I'm still not as sure as I'd ideally like to be of what's going on with that.No longer blocks: [b2gGeckoSecurity](/show_bug.cgi?id=866876 "RESOLVED INVALID - [TRACKER] B2G Gecko security")Flags: needinfo?(jld)

This is basically a port of [1] to our much older (modified) branch of the code.
I've had to change a few things to get it to work.
For the other changes mentioned in the bug:
[2] doesn't apply to our version of the code
[3] is a sandboxing code change, which we already have
I'm afraid I completely forgot about be careful pushing sec bugs to try ... sorry:

This strikes me as a little hacky. It would be nicer if GenerateVerifiedChannelID returned some kind of struct or tuple of (id, secret) or (channel-id, safe-pipe-id) instead, and Channel was constructed with that.

I assume the way the shared secret makes its way to the child process in the first place is a command line argument to CreateProcess(). If that's the case, we should check that unprivileged processes can't query that information with NtQueryInformationProcess(). Or as a precaution we could zap the PEB command line memory after it's been consumed.

Yeah, I wondered about that.
For what it's worth, I don't think that Chrome clears the command line memory at all and certainly you can still see the channel ID and secret in Process Explorer.
As another part of this bug fix they started using an untrusted integrity level on the renderers, I think to stop them from opening other low (or higher) integrity processes like their gpu process.
We can't use untrusted on the content process currently and I'm not clear what benefit that would give us at the moment anyway.
We use untrusted as the delayed integrity level for GMP processes.
I suppose the other risk (such as it is) is from other low privileged processes from using the pipe and impersonating a Gecko child process.
I'm not sure how easy it would be for them to determine and open a child process, steal the secret and then use their pipe.
I'm pretty new to all this IPC stuff, so it would be good for me to investigate it and see if clearing the secret or other measures would be useful.
I'm on PTO tomorrow and next week, so would you mind if I picked this up in a follow-up bug?
Although, I suspect I'm not going to get this landed before I go anyway. :)

In general I was trying to keep this as close to the chromium patch as possible, while not changing too much of our existing code.
Life is already made difficult by the fact that our chromium IPC code is so old and by the fact that we have modified it fairly heavily.
I was trying to not make matters worse, although maybe that's a lost cause. :-)
I've commented about the ones that aren't style / typos below.
If you still want the proposed changes I'll have to pick this up after my PTO.

I agree, I imagine that they were trying to prevent the patch from hitting too many areas of their code, but I'm only guessing.
It does seem a bit odd given that in their patch they've already changed to use a ChannelHandle, so should have been able to add this without too much pain.
In our case we would have to change the other parts that use channel id and we'd end up moving this parsing logic to where we read the command line parameter.

There was another part of the code, that we don't have, that passes null.
Not entirely sure where they use that.

Yeah, I found this difficult to read, but I suppose it depends on whether the extra confusion of moving further away form their code is worth it.
I agree that this is clearer.
I think that other changes that didn't fit into our code would have made dropping validate\_client\_ altogether a little more difficult.

I suppose it is the client side of the pipe, but I agree this can be confusing.
Our use of Parent and Child has confused me a bit it the past as well. :-)Flags: needinfo?(dvander)

Ah, I see. It doesn't bother me too much if we diverge from Chromium, since that ship sailed a long time ago. I would really like to see the word "client\_" changed and validate\_client\_ removed if possible, the other stuff I'll leave up to you.Flags: needinfo?(dvander)

Fixed.

I don't remember it, but I think it is definitely clearer with the multi-lines.

Unfortunately mode isn't available here or in the other place where we'd need it.
I could have added it as a member variable, but that seemed like a bigger change.
So, I've renamed validate\_client\_ to waiting\_for\_shared\_secret\_ and changed the comments, to hopefully make it clear what is going on here.

As above mode isn't available here.
I also made the comment clearer here (hopefully).

Verify the child process with a secret hello on Windows. v2
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
You would need to have a compromised process on the machine already, so that you could run arbitrary code.
Even then, the most you could do is "impersonate" a gecko child process using the named pipe.
For what it's worth, the Chromium guys only marked this as medium severity.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
Yes, the comments make the issue clear.
Also, this is already a public bug as it is reported for Chromium.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
Since the Chromium IPC code landed, I think, so all.
However, I think we only started using it for real, when either GMP or the thumbnail generation started to be used.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
n/a
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
Doesn't quite apply cleanly on Beta/Aurora (because of one of my own changes :-) ), but would be really easy to fix, if it were deemed necessary.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Should be pretty safe and if it does cause regressions, they should be fairly obvious and widespread for e10s on Windows I think.

Attached patch

[Aurora/Beta - Verify the child process with a secret hello on Windows.](attachment.cgi?id=8596514&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8596514&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1087565&attachment=8596514)

Minor rebase due to some surrounding context changes.
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]:
The code would have been brought in with the first cut of Chromium IPC code back in June 2009.
[User impact if declined]:
In theory a compromised, but low privileged process would be able to impersonate a Gecko child process, possible achieving some privilege escalation through communication with the firefox.exe process.
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]:
Child processes are tested through GMP/EME, e10s and (I believe) thumbnail generation tests.
[Risks and why]:
Medium-low - while not a trivial patch the idea behind it is simple. Any issues would hopefully be obvious as the code is involved with the IPC channel initialisation.
[String/UUID change made/needed]:
None.

Attached patch

[ESR31 - Verify the child process with a secret hello on Windows.](attachment.cgi?id=8596522&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8596522&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1087565&attachment=8596522)

Again mainly surrounding context changes, but also an old version of ipc/chromium/src/base/atomic\_sequence\_num.h existed.
It looks like this was removed some time after ESR31, as it wasn't being used, so I've just overwritten it with the new version.
[Approval Request Comment]
If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration:
sec-high
User impact if declined:
In theory a compromised, but low privileged process would be able to impersonate a Gecko child process, possible achieving some privilege escalation through communication with the firefox.exe process.
Fix Landed on Version:
Fx40
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky):
Medium-low - while not a trivial patch the idea behind it is simple. Any issues would hopefully be obvious as the code is involved with the IPC channel initialisation.
String or UUID changes made by this patch:
None

Is this a security issue for ESR31? I didn't think we had any sandboxing on that branch, but maybe there are NPAPI plugins doing their own sandboxing that could be escaped this way?

Well, we have the thumbnail content process.
So, in theory a compromised non-gecko low privileged process could impersonate that process.
Like I've said before, I'm not sure how easy that would be in reality or whether it would be able to do anything damaging.

I'm not sure how you would go about testing this other than observing (using something like Process Explorer) that there is now a random secret number on the end of the channel ID in the command line.
If you managed to pause the child process (through debugging) before it connected to the named pipe and attempted to connect to the the named pipe (which is the channel ID without the extra "/<unique number>").
If you then don't send the correct Hello message (including the random secret) then it should fail.
In the Chromium bug, I think this was just a theoretical attack, it didn't have any PoC exploits.
The theory in the bug is that on Windows low privileged processes can enumerate named pipes and could potentially attempt to connect to them.Flags: needinfo?(bobowen.code)

I was able to verify this on Windows 7 x64, in Firefox ESR 31.7.0 and 38.0, using Process Explorer. The plugin-container.exe process displays "\<random number>" appended at the end of the "--channel" parameter in the Command Line field. This appended value does not show in an older build like 31.2.0 ESR.

I think it makes sense to credit both of us — cdiehl reported it to Mozilla originally, but the bug wasn't recognized as security-sensitive until I found it.Flags: needinfo?(jld) → needinfo?(cdiehl)

#### [#CVE-2018-18500: Use-after-free parsing HTML5 stream](#CVE-2018-18500)

Reporter
Yaniv Frank with SophosLabs
Impact
critical
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur while parsing an HTML5 stream in concert with custom HTML elements. This results in the stream parser object being freed while still in use, leading to a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

#### [#CVE-2018-18504: Memory corruption and out-of-bounds read of texture client buffer](#CVE-2018-18504)

Reporter
Markus Vervier of X41 D-SEC GmbH
Impact
high
##### Description

A crash and out-of-bounds read can occur when the buffer of a texture client is freed while it is still in use during graphic operations. This results in a potentially exploitable crash and the possibility of reading from the memory of the freed buffers.

##### References

* [Bug 1496413](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1496413)

#### [#CVE-2018-18505: Privilege escalation through IPC channel messages](#CVE-2018-18505)

Reporter
Jed Davis
Impact
high
##### Description

An earlier fix for an Inter-process Communication (IPC) vulnerability, CVE-2011-3079, added authentication to communication between IPC endpoints and server parents during IPC process creation. This authentication is insufficient for channels created after the IPC process is started, leading to the authentication not being correctly applied to later channels. This could allow for a sandbox escape through IPC channels due to lack of message validation in the listener process.

#### [#CVE-2018-18503: Memory corruption with Audio Buffer](#CVE-2018-18503)

Reporter

Impact
moderate
##### Description

When JavaScript is used to create and manipulate an audio buffer, a potentially exploitable crash may occur because of a compartment mismatch in some situations.

#### [#CVE-2018-18506: Proxy Auto-Configuration file can define localhost access to be proxied](#CVE-2018-18506)

Reporter
Jann Horn
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When proxy auto-detection is enabled, if a web server serves a Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC) file or if a PAC file is loaded locally, this PAC file can specify that requests to the localhost are to be sent through the proxy to another server. This behavior is disallowed by default when a proxy is manually configured, but when enabled could allow for attacks on services and tools that bind to the localhost for networked behavior if they are accessed through browsing.

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service, gain additional

privileges by escaping the sandbox, or execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-18500](/security/CVE-2018-18500), [CVE-2018-18501](/security/CVE-2018-18501), [CVE-2018-18502](/security/CVE-2018-18502), [CVE-2018-18503](/security/CVE-2018-18503),

[CVE-2018-18504](/security/CVE-2018-18504), [CVE-2018-18505](/security/CVE-2018-18505))

It was discovered that Firefox allowed PAC files to specify that requests

to localhost are sent through the proxy to another server. If proxy

auto-detection is enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to

conduct attacks on local services and tools. ([CVE-2018-18506](/security/CVE-2018-18506))

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1670633#c0)  Doran Moppert    2019-01-29 23:18:56 UTC  ``` An earlier fix for an Inter-process Communication (IPC) vulnerability, [CVE-2011-3079](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3079), added authentication to communication between IPC endpoints and server parents during IPC process creation. This authentication is insufficient for channels created after the IPC process is started, leading to the authentication not being correctly applied to later channels. This could allow for a sandbox escape through IPC channels due to lack of message validation in the listener process.

On Windows we implement IPC channels using named pipes: the server (parent) side creates a pipe and then the client (child) side connects to it by name.
[Bug 1087565](/show_bug.cgi?id=1087565 "RESOLVED FIXED - IPC Channel does not validate the listener.") / [CVE-2011-3079](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-3079) dealt with the possibility of a sandboxed process connecting to a channel meant for another process and impersonating it to achieve privilege escalation, by adding a 32-bit shared secret that the client must send to the server. (According to comments in the upstream patch, the pipe namespace can be enumerated even by low-privileged processes.)
However, this works correctly only for the initial channel created when the process is started; additional channels created by passing Endpoint instances over IPC don't do this.
The Endpoint-bound channels use a different ChannelImpl constructor ([1] vs. [2]); it behaves similarly in the client, but in the server it doesn't initialize the shared secret, which means[3] that it silently ignores the client's secret and doesn't verify it.
This may predate [bug 1223240](/show_bug.cgi?id=1223240 "RESOLVED FIXED - Make it easier to set up top-level protocols"), which added the Endpoint system: that ChannelImpl constructor goes back to [bug 564086](/show_bug.cgi?id=564086 "RESOLVED FIXED - IPDL: Offer a PFoo::Bridge(process1, process2) interface to open a new IPC channel between process1/process2") (part j in the patch series), and it's not in upstream Chromium, so this could be something that was overlooked during the crossport in [bug 1087565](/show_bug.cgi?id=1087565 "RESOLVED FIXED - IPC Channel does not validate the listener.").
I haven't constructed a proof-of-concept to verify this; I discovered it by accident while doing Try runs with extra logging to investigate [bug 1368036](/show_bug.cgi?id=1368036 "RESOLVED FIXED - Intermittent Windows TC TEST-UNEXPECTED-FAIL | leakcheck | tab process: missing output line for total leaks!"). It should be relatively easy to make the client send a bad secret (or none) for this type of channel, but I don't currently have a Windows development environment, and a patch like that probably shouldn't be pushed to a public repo like Try.

I couldn't see where this was using the other constructor at first, but it's when the TransportDescriptor is opened at [1].
On the face of it this looks fairly easy to fix.

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1497749&attachment=9028909)

This gets the shared secret from the channel ID even when we don't need the pipe name.
I tested that it was checking the secret by incremening it, which caused the message from the NOTREACHED() after the secret check and killed the child.

Get secret from channel ID when pipe handle passed.
[Security Approval Request]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?: The issue that this was trying to address was a theoretical one in the original chromium bug, I don't think they had anything close to a PoC.
However I think it is relatively obvious from the patch what is being fixed, assuming you understand the original problem.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?: Yes
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?: All
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?: None
Do you have backports for the affected branches?: Yes
If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?:
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?: This code gets used for all channels set up through Endpoints, so just running firefox exercises it multiple times.
The change is very simple and once the shared secret is extracted from the channel ID it is checked by the same code used for the main channel.

If it matters for CVE assignment or release notes or something like that: what's going on here is that our original fix for [CVE-2011-3079](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-3079) was incomplete, because of how our fork had diverged from Chromium, and this corrects that.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
