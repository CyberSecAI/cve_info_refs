Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `exec.php` script directly uses user-supplied input from the `command` GET parameter in a `popen` function call without sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Command Injection:** The application is vulnerable to command injection because it allows arbitrary commands to be executed on the server. This occurs because the user-controlled `command` parameter is passed directly to the `popen()` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the server. This could lead to:
    - Data breaches/loss
    - Full system compromise
    - Denial of service
    - Installation of malware
    - Lateral movement to other systems.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exposed through the HTTP GET parameter named `command` in the `exec.php` script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable `exec.php` script.
- No authentication appears necessary based on the information provided.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code snippet:

```php
$c = \_GET('command', 'unknow');
$handle = popen($c, "r");
```

This code retrieves the value of the `command` parameter from the GET request. If the `command` parameter is not provided, it defaults to 'unknow'. This value is then directly passed as the command to the `popen()` function, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

**Example Exploit:**

The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) ` /exec.php?command=dir ` demonstrates the vulnerability by using the command parameter to execute the `dir` command (on a Windows server) or `ls` command (on a Linux server) and return the directory listing. An attacker can replace this with any other command, resulting in severe consequences.
