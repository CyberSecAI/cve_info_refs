      "description": "A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in libgig 4.1.0 in the RIFF::List::GetListTypeString[abi:cxx11]() const function at src/RIFF.cpp:1536:32.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is triggered during the processing of a crafted RIFF file, where the function attempts to read data beyond the allocated buffer.",
      "impact": "The heap-buffer-overflow could potentially allow an attacker to overwrite memory, leading to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
