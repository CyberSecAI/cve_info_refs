Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-18987:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the deserialization of untrusted data. The program populates objects with user-supplied input via a file without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502):** The application directly deserializes user-provided data from a file without proper checks, leading to the potential for attacker-controlled input to overwrite memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Program Crash:** Exploitation can cause the program to crash due to corrupted memory.
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could potentially allow remote code execution by the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted file that, when processed by the vulnerable application, triggers the deserialization flaw.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
- **Low Skill Level:** Exploitation is described as requiring a low skill level.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires some user interaction (likely involving opening a malicious file).
