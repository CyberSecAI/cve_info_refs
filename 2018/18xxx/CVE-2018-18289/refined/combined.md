### More details

There are many of us sysadmins out there who use Confluence as a primary source of information about their hardware and software -- the type of information that would likely contain installation instructions, configuration files, performance reports and other valuable bits and pieces of information. This is usually accompanied by network monitoring tools such as Nagios or Zabbix. This plugin is used to add Zabbix charts (or graphs) to Confluence to illustrate configuration details and reports with online visual information. It is also possible to import text information from Zabbix – such as Zabbix items and alerts (or triggers). For more information please visit [About Zabbix Plugin](https://mesilat.com/wiki/display/ZP) page.
