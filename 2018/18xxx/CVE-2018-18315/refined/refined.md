The content provided describes a vulnerability in the `lemon` project, specifically an arbitrary file upload vulnerability. Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability exists in the `CdnController.java` file which has a file upload functionality.
* The `CdnUtils.copyMultipartFileToFile` method is called to handle file uploads.
* This method only checks for ".." in the filename, but does not validate the file type or the `spaceName` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Arbitrary File Upload:** The lack of file type validation allows attackers to upload any file type.
* **Path Traversal:** The `spaceName` parameter, which is not validated, can be manipulated to perform path traversal, allowing files to be written to arbitrary locations on the server's filesystem.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* An attacker can upload malicious files, such as web shells, to the server.
* By exploiting the path traversal vulnerability, the attacker can place these files in locations where they can be executed.
* This can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) and full compromise of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
* The attack vector is through the file upload functionality in the `CdnController.java` file.
* Attackers can send a crafted HTTP request with a malicious file and a manipulated `spaceName` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the file upload endpoint in `CdnController.java`.
* They need to be able to manipulate the `spaceName` parameter to achieve path traversal.

**Additional Notes:**
* The issue was reported by 360 Code Guard team.
* The provided screenshots show the vulnerable code snippet, highlighting the lack of validation on the `spaceName` parameter and file type.
