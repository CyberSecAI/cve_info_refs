```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-controlled data before using it in SQL queries. Specifically, several parameters such as 'px' from cookies, 'tablename' and 'tabletag' from GET parameters and 'zxbigclassid' from cookies are directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper validation or sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection",
    "Lack of input sanitization"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. In some cases, the attacker can obtain sensitive information such as database users, versions, and database names. The vulnerabilities also allow for blind SQL injection through time-based methods.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP GET parameters",
    "HTTP Cookie parameters",
    "HTTP Host header"
   ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and, in some cases, to set cookies or manipulate headers. Some of the identified vulnerabilities also require an administrative user login. The attacker does not need to be authenticated for all vulnerabilities."
