Based on the provided content, here's an analysis regarding CVE-2018-18726:

**Verification:**
The provided content is directly related to a reported vulnerability in `yunucms 1.1.5`, which is consistent with the information expected for a CVE analysis. This issue is specifically a Stored XSS vulnerability, which aligns with typical vulnerabilities that receive CVE assignments.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization in the `yunucms` application. Specifically, when editing site links through the admin interface, the application does not sanitize user-provided input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The main vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This means the malicious script provided by the attacker is stored in the application's database and executed when other users view the affected content.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker exploiting this vulnerability can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session. This could lead to various impacts such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Phishing attacks
    *   Stealing sensitive user information (if present on the page)
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the administrative interface of `yunucms`. An attacker can insert the malicious script by editing a site link via the admin panel.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must have administrative access to the `yunucms` system to modify site links. This means they need to be able to log in to the admin panel using valid credentials.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Affected Component:** The `sitelink` edit functionality within the admin panel is the affected component.
*   **Proof of Concept (POC):** The provided POC demonstrates how to inject the script using the following payload: `<script>alert(123)</script>`.
*   **Vulnerability Trigger Point:** The vulnerability is triggered on the page located at `<http://localhost/admin/sitelink/editsitelink?id=16>`, specifically during the editing of sitelinks.
