Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities found in libgig 4.1.0, as described in the provided README:

**1. Heap-buffer-overflow in `RIFF::List::GetListTypeString` (src/RIFF.cpp:1536:32)**

*   **Root Cause:** A heap-buffer-overflow occurs when reading the list type string.
*   **Weakness:** Out-of-bounds read on the heap.
*   **Impact:** Crash of the application, potential arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted RIFF file.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted RIFF file to the application.

**2. Out-of-bounds read in `DLS::File::GetFirstSample` (src/DLS.cpp:1515:14)**

*   **Root Cause:** An out-of-bounds read when accessing sample data. Specifically, the `WavePoolTableIndex` is used to index `file->pWavePoolTable` without proper bounds checking which leads to access out of the bounds of `pWavePoolTable`.
*   **Weakness:** Out-of-bounds read.
*  **Impact:** Crash of the application due to a segmentation fault.
*   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted DLS file.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted DLS file to the application.

**3. `operator new[]` failure in `DLS::Sampler::Sampler` (src/DLS.cpp:570:51)**

*   **Root Cause:** An attempt to allocate a large chunk of memory using `new[]`, which fails, likely due to an excessively large value for `SampleLoops`.
*   **Weakness:**  Uncontrolled memory allocation size which leads to allocation failure.
*   **Impact:** Crash of the application due to the allocation failure.
*   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted DLS file containing a large value for `SampleLoops`.
*    **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted DLS file to the application.

**4. Heap-buffer-overflow in `DLS::Region::GetSample` (src/DLS.cpp:1052:33)**

*   **Root Cause:** A heap-buffer-overflow when accessing sample data through the `file->pWavePoolTable` array which is indexed by `WavePoolTableIndex`.
*  **Weakness:** Out-of-bounds read on the heap.
*   **Impact:** Crash of the application, potential arbitrary code execution.
*  **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted DLS file.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted DLS file to the application.

**5. `operator new[]` failure in `DLS::File::File` (DLS.cpp:1462)**

*   **Root Cause:** An attempt to allocate a large chunk of memory using `new[]` for `pWavePoolTable`, which fails likely due to an excessively large value for `WavePoolCount`.
*  **Weakness:** Uncontrolled memory allocation size.
*   **Impact:** Crash of the application due to the allocation failure.
*   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted DLS file containing a large value for `WavePoolCount`.
*    **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted DLS file to the application.

**6. FPE (Floating Point Exception) in `DLS::Sample::Sample` (DLS.cpp:743:92)**

*   **Root Cause:** A division by zero error occurs when calculating `SamplesTotal` because `FrameSize` is zero.
*   **Weakness:** Division by zero.
*   **Impact:** Crash of the application due to a floating point exception.
*   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted DLS file which results in `FrameSize` being zero.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted DLS file to the application.
