### CVE-2018-18471
The provided content describes CVE-2018-18471, an **XXE and Unauthenticated Remote Command Execution vulnerability** affecting Axentra Hipserv NAS firmware, which is used in devices like Netgear Stora, Seagate GoFlex Home, and Medion LifeCloud.

*   **Root Cause:**
    *   **Part 1 (XXE):** The vulnerability lies in the `/api/2.0/rest/aggregator/xml` endpoint, which loads XML data from POST requests. An outdated version of `libxml2` is used as a backend in the firmware, which does not have external entity loading disabled by default.
    *   **Part 2 (RCE):** The web interface's REST API makes calls to a local daemon named `oe-spd` on port 2000 (bound to 127.0.0.1) to perform root actions. This daemon takes XML data, parses it, and executes actions without authentication, only ensuring the request originates from 127.0.0.1. Additionally, the daemon skips junk data until finding a specific string which simplifies payload construction. The daemon has command execution bugs.

*   **Weakness:**
    *   **XXE:** Unrestricted external entity loading in the XML parser.
    *   **RCE:** Lack of authentication for the `oe-spd` daemon and command execution vulnerabilities within the daemon.
    *   The web server runs as a non-root user and has no sudo rights, but the REST API makes calls to a local daemon named `oe-spd` which runs as root.

*   **Impact:**
    *   An attacker can read files and perform SSRF attacks using the XXE vulnerability.
    *   The RCE vulnerability allows attackers to execute commands with the highest privileges (root) on the affected devices, enabling them to read/modify files, add/remove users, and modify data. Successful exploitation leads to gaining root remote command execution on the devices and, therefore, the entire network they are on.

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   **XXE:** Sending a crafted HTTP PUT request to the `/xml/aggregator/` endpoint with a malicious XML payload containing an external entity.
    *   **RCE:** Exploiting the XXE vulnerability to redirect the XML parser to a PHP script (or similar) that redirects the request to `http://127.0.0.1:2000/a.php?d=[payload]`, targeting the vulnerable `oe-spd` daemon.

*   **Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker needs to know the IP address of the target NAS device.
    *   The attacker can be remote since the vulnerability is unauthenticated and remotely exploitable.
