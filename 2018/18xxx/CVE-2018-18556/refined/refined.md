{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `pppd` command, when executed with sudo, allows an operator user to execute arbitrary commands by leveraging the `connect`, `disconnect`, `init`, `welcome` and `plugin` parameters which take an arbitrary script/command as an argument. The `plugin` option loads a shared library object file as a plugin.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure sudo configuration allowing operator users to execute `pppd` as root.",
       "The `pppd` command allows execution of arbitrary commands via several parameters."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation leads to complete compromise of the system via privilege escalation from operator to root.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "Escaping the restricted operator shell using other vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-18555)",
        "Executing the `pppd` command with sudo and a crafted `connect`, `disconnect`, `init`, `welcome` or `plugin` parameter.",
        "Using `netcat` to get a reverse shell.",
        "Loading a malicious shared library via the plugin parameter to execute arbitrary code as root"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have access to an operator account on the VyOS system and the ability to execute `sudo` commands with the privileges to execute `/sbin/pppd`."
