- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The ProFiles 1.5 component for Joomla does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when creating a new folder, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The `name` and `path` parameters within the `com_profiles` component are vulnerable.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they interact with the affected component. This could lead to the compromise of user accounts, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `administrator/index.php?option=com_profiles&format=raw&view=rootsandrights` endpoint, with malicious JavaScript code injected within the `name` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the Joomla administrator panel. This likely implies the attacker needs to be authenticated as a user with permission to access the `com_profiles` component.
