Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an unauthenticated deserialization vulnerability within the `getimagesize()` function that can be triggered by an attacker-controlled URL. The application retrieves image information via a URL provided by the user. It then uses `getimagesize` on the retrieved URL, which if supplied with a crafted phar file, can be exploited to trigger the deserialization vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Unauthenticated Deserialization:** The core vulnerability is the ability to trigger PHP's `unserialize()` function indirectly through `getimagesize()` using a specially crafted phar archive. This happens without the need for prior authentication or authorization, which allows remote code execution.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The `fetchPageInfo` function allows an attacker to make requests to arbitrary URLs, which is an SSRF vulnerability. Though reported, it wasn't the primary focus, but part of the exploit chain to control the source attribute of an image tag.
*   **Lack of Proper Input Validation/Sanitization:** The application fails to validate or sanitize the URL used in the `getimagesize()` function, allowing an attacker to provide a malicious URL with the `phar://` scheme.
*  **Insecure use of `getimagesize()`**: The `getimagesize()` function is used on a user-controlled URL which can lead to a deserialization vulnerability by using the `phar://` scheme.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, leading to a complete compromise of the application and the underlying server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted GET request to the `/dashboard/utility/fetchPageInfo` endpoint with an attacker-controlled URL that points to a malicious web server.
*   **Malicious Phar Archive:** The attacker hosts a specially crafted phar archive (e.g., `poc.phar`, renamed to `poc.jpg` ) on their web server which is downloaded by the vulnerable application through `getimagesize`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Vanilla Forums instance.
*   **Ability to Host Files:** The attacker needs to host the malicious phar archive on a web server accessible to the vulnerable server.
*   **Understanding of PHP Deserialization:** The attacker must understand the mechanics of PHP deserialization and how to exploit it using a malicious phar archive.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by a combination of SSRF, and improper use of `getimagesize` which leads to the deserialization flaw.
*   The official advisory provided by Vanilla was not descriptive and didn't mention the security impact.
*   The patch involves additional checks within the `absoluteSource` function.

**CVE ID:**
The vulnerability is identified as **CVE-2018-18903**, as mentioned in the srcincite.io article.
