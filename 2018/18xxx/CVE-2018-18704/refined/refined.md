Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the security vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `index.php` script of the phptpoint Pharmacy Management System, where user input for the `username` field is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The code directly uses the user-supplied `username` value in the SQL query:
    ```php
    $result=mysql_query("SELECT admin_id, username FROM admin WHERE username='$username' AND password='$password'");
    ```
    This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can bypass the login mechanism and gain unauthorized access as an administrator or any other user by injecting SQL code that makes the query return true.
*   **Data Breach:** The attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive data stored in the database, including user credentials.
*   **Data Manipulation:**  The attacker could modify or delete data in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed using a crafted HTTP POST request to the login page `index.php`.
*   **Manipulated Username Field:** The core of the attack lies in injecting SQL code into the `username` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application (e.g., access to the network where the vulnerable system is deployed).
*   **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs basic SQL knowledge to craft the malicious payload.
*  **No prior authentication is required:** The vulnerability is located at the login page.

**Payload:**
The provided exploit uses the following payload in the `username` field:
```
username=admin%27+OR+1+--+
```
This payload, when injected into the vulnerable query, will always evaluate to true and bypass authentication. Specifically:
   *   `admin'` closes the original string context of the username, preventing any accidental or incorrect SQL syntax.
   *   `OR 1` creates a condition that will always be true.
    *   `--` comments out the rest of the query, avoiding any syntax errors.
