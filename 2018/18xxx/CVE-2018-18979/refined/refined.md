  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application uses a static key and initialization vector (IV) for AES encryption.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Hardcoded cryptographic key and IV",
      "Weak certificate pinning implementation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can decrypt and modify any user's data on the platform. This includes sensitive information like glucose level readings, which, if tampered with, could lead to misdiagnosis and harm to the patient.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle attack to intercept and modify network traffic.",
      "Reverse engineering of the mobile application to extract the static key and IV."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to intercept network traffic between the mobile app and the backend servers using a proxy tool such as Burp Suite, achieved through a jailbroken iPhone (or rooted Android device)",
       "Ability to reverse engineer the mobile application binary, obtainable on a rooted Android device, to identify the encryption scheme and extract the hardcoded key and IV.",
       "Knowledge of cryptography, specifically AES-CBC-PKCS5Padding"
    ],
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability was found in the mobile application of the 'Contour Next One' glucometer. The application used a static key and IV to encrypt the data sent to the backend server. This allowed the researchers to decrypt and re-encrypt data, enabling them to enumerate other users' encrypted data and modify user information. The application used UTF-16LE encoding which was necessary for decryption.  The researchers also identified and bypassed weak certificate pinning."
