The provided content is related to CVE-2018-18938.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the wuzhicms application. Specifically, the application does not properly neutralize or encode the `<details>` tag with an `ontoggle` event handler containing JavaScript, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists.
- Inadequate input validation and sanitization.
- Allowing HTML tags with event handlers without proper escaping.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary web script or HTML injection
- Potential for account compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities
- Execution of arbitrary javascript in the victim's browser session

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can inject a malicious XSS payload by inserting a crafted string into a specific field in the wuzhicms admin panel.
- The crafted payload is stored in the database and executed when the page is viewed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrative privileges to log in to the wuzhicms admin panel.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the part of the application that allows the injection of the payload (e.g., configuration settings).

**Additional details:**

- The provided POC demonstrates how to inject an XSS payload using the `<details>` tag with `open` and `ontoggle` event attributes, executing `alert(2)`.
- The vulnerability is located in the core index page of the application
- The vulnerable code is triggered when viewing the modified content through the wuzhicms admin panel.
