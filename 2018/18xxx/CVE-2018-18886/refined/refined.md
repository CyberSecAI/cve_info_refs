**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The vulnerability is an XSS flaw, which means that a malicious script can be injected into the web application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The content refers to this as a "serious XSS vulnerability", suggesting the impact could include:
  - Execution of malicious scripts within the user's browser when interacting with the application.
  - Potential session hijacking or other forms of data compromise.
  - Defacement of the application's user interface.
- The provided text also notes, "if you are running a prior version, including 1.x releases, you should upgrade to `2.2.0` as soon as possible." This confirms a significant risk to users of older versions.

**Attack vectors:**
