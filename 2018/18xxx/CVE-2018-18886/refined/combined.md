# Displaying verification statuses for all of your commits

You can enable vigilant mode for commit signature verification to mark all of your commits and tags with a signature verification status.

## In this article

* [About vigilant mode](#about-vigilant-mode)
* [Enabling vigilant mode](#enabling-vigilant-mode)
## [About vigilant mode](#about-vigilant-mode)

When you work locally on your computer, Git allows you to set the author of your changes and the identity of the committer. This, potentially, makes it difficult for other people to be confident that commits and tags you create were actually created by you. To help solve this problem you can sign your commits and tags. For more information, see [Signing commits](/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits) and [Signing tags](/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-tags). GitHub marks signed commits and tags with a verification status.

By default commits and tags are marked "Verified" if they are signed with a GPG, SSH, or S/MIME key that was successfully verified. If a commit or tag has a signature that can't be verified by GitHub, we mark the commit or tag "Unverified." In all other cases no verification status is displayed.

However, you can give other users increased confidence in the identity attributed to your commits and tags by enabling vigilant mode in your GitHub settings. With vigilant mode enabled, all of your commits and tags are marked with one of three verification statuses:

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Verified** | The commit is signed, the signature was successfully verified, and the committer is the only author who has enabled vigilant mode. |
| **Partially verified** | The commit is signed, and the signature was successfully verified, but the commit has an author who: a) is not the committer and b) has enabled vigilant mode. In this case, the commit signature doesn't guarantee the consent of the author, so the commit is only partially verified. |
| **Unverified** | Any of the following is true:- The commit is signed but the signature could not be verified.- The commit is not signed and the committer has enabled vigilant mode.- The commit is not signed and an author has enabled vigilant mode. |

You should only enable vigilant mode if you sign all of your commits and tags and use an email address that is verified for your GitHub account as your committer email address. After enabling this mode, any unsigned commits or tags that you generate locally and push to GitHub will be marked "Unverified."

You can check the verification status of your signed commits or tags on GitHub and view why your commit signatures might be unverified. For more information, see [Checking your commit and tag signature verification status](/en/authentication/troubleshooting-commit-signature-verification/checking-your-commit-and-tag-signature-verification-status).

## [Enabling vigilant mode](#enabling-vigilant-mode)

1. In the upper-right corner of any page on GitHub, click your profile photo, then click  **Settings**.
2. In the "Access" section of the sidebar, click  **SSH and GPG keys**.
3. Under "Vigilant mode," select **Flag unsigned commits as unverified**.

# Helpy: A Modern Helpdesk Platform

Helpy is a modern help desk platform written in Ruby on Rails and released under the MIT license. The goal of Helpy is to power your support email and ticketing, integrate seamlessly with your app, and run an amazing customer helpcenter.

[![Build Status](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/b02096385a030756444ad9d881ca14604cb354c6cdbae9e4fe2c4cd2ff9cdf82/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f7472617669732f68656c7079696f2f68656c70792f6d61737465722e737667)](https://travis-ci.org/helpyio/helpy) [![Code Climate](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e469f0c29e364b5b16dc1725ac5038ba5497bee51acf4ad537861f016709aa09/68747470733a2f2f636f6465636c696d6174652e636f6d2f6769746875622f68656c7079696f2f68656c70792f6261646765732f6770612e737667)](https://codeclimate.com/github/helpyio/helpy)

# Sponsor/Support Helpy

Helpy is licensed under the MIT license, and is an open-core project. This means that the core functionality is 100% open source and fully hackable or even re-sellable under the MIT license. See the features comparison below to understand what is included.

Helpy is a large system and cannot exist purely as a hobby project. If you use it in a money generating capacity, it makes good sense to support the project financially or by becoming an official sponsor or supporter.

# Open Source Features

Helpy is an integrated support solution- combining and leveraging synergies between support ticketing, Knowledgebase and a public community. Each feature is optional however, and can be easily disabled.

* **Multichannel ticketing:** Integrated with inbound email via Sendgrid, Mandrill, Mailgun, etc.
* **Knowledgebase:** Full text searchable and SEO optimized to help users answer questions before they contact you.
* **Mobile-friendly:** Support requests come at all times, and Helpy works on all devices out of the box so you can delight customers with prompt answers, from anywhere and at anytime!
* **Community Support Forums:** Customers and Agents can both answer questions in a publicly accessible forum, and vote both threads and replies up or down accordingly.
* **Embed Widget:** Helpy Includes a lightweight javascript widget that allows your users to contact you from just about anywhere.
* **Multi-lingual:** Helpy is fully multi-lingual and can provide support in multiple languages at the same time. Currently the app includes translations for 19 languages and is easy to translate.
* **Themeable:** Customize the look and functionality of your Helpy without disturbing the underlying system that makes it all work. Helpy comes with two additional themes, and we hope to add more and get more from the community as time goes on.
* **Sends HTML email:** Responses to customers can include html, emojis and attachments.
* **Customizable:** Set colors to match your brand both on the helpcenter, and in the ticketing UI.
* **GDPR Compliant:** Comply with GDPR right to be forgotten requests by deleting users and their history, or by anonymizing them.

# Pro Version

We also offer a pro version with additional features designed to make your helpcenter even more awesome. This is available as either a turn-key SaaS or AWS/Azure marketplace product. Both spin up in seconds. Proceeds go directly towards supporting the continued development of the project. Some of the things found in the pro version:

* **Triggers:** Insert events at any point in the ticket lifecycle. This includes an outbound JSON API.
* **Notifications:** Browser notifications when new tickets are received, you are assigned to a ticket, etc.
* **Real time UI:** When tickets arrive, they are automatically added to the UI
* **Custom Views:** Add additional Ticketing queues to highlight just the tickets you need to see
* **Advanced reporting:** A suite of additional reports on the performance of your ticketing and helpcenter knowledgebase
* **Advanced search:** Easily filter and find tickets or customers when you have thousands
* **Customizable Request Forms:** Easily Add questions to the ticket creation forms
* **AI Support Chatbot:** Create a chatbot for your website to answer up 90% of tier one questions autonomously

# Getting Started:

**Helpy Pro - 30 Second one-click install via DigitalOcean**

You can launch the free tier of Helpy Pro using the DigitalOcean Marketplace. This "one click" marketplace image spins up a dedicated VM within 30 seconds, running Ubuntu. [Launch DigitalOcean Marketplace Image](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/helpy-pro?refcode=1368cfa70df6). Use of all features requires either a trial or paid license code, available here: [Helpy License Center](https://support.helpy.io/orders)

**Install Helpy via Docker**

Docker is the recommended way to quickly test or run Helpy in production.

1. Install [Docker](https://get.docker.com/) and docker-compose
2. Create config file from template `cp docker/.env.sample docker/.env` and edit `docker/.env` to match your needs
3. Edit `docker/Caddyfile` to include your URL or turn on SSL
4. Build Helpy from local git checkout `docker-compose build`
5. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start all of the services

**Install Helpy on your Local System**

Although not required, installing locally is highly recommended and will make it easier for you to customize things like settings, colors and logos to match your site identity. To begin, clone Helpy from the official repo to your local system:

`git clone https://github.com/helpyio/helpy.git`

**Configure Basic Settings**

There is a settings option in the admin panel to set up things like i18n, system names, colors, the embeddable widget, etc. There is a full guide to getting set up at: [Configuring Your Helpy Settings](http://support.helpy.io/en/knowledgebase/11-Installing-Helpy/docs/22-Configuring-your-Helpy-Settings)

**Support Multiple Languages (optional)**

Helpy includes support for Multilingual help sites, and multi-language knowledgebase articles. This page explains how to enable Helpy's international capabilities and provides an overview of what functionality this adds to Helpy: [How To Set Up A Multilingual Helpy Support Knowledgebase](http://support.helpy.io/en/knowledgebase/12-Using-Helpy/docs/9-How-to-set-up-a-multilingual-Helpy-support-knowledgebase)

**Set up your Helpy to send and receive email (optional)**

Helpy has the ability to receive email at your support email addresses and import the messages as tickets in the web interface. Whenever you or the user replies to the email thread, Helpy captures the discussion and sends out messages accordingly. Follow the tutorial on [Setting Up Your Helpy Installation To Send And Receive Email](http://support.helpy.io/en/knowledgebase/11-Installing-Helpy/docs/14-Setting-up-your-Helpy-installation-to-send-and-receive-email) to set this up.

**Configure oAuth (optional)**

Helpy supports Omniauth login capabilities. This means you can allow your support users to sign in with a single click via any Omniauth provider- ie. Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, or many others. Read [Setting Up Oauth For Your Helpy](https://github.com/helpyio/helpy/wiki/SSO--Configuring-OAUTH) to see how.

# Live Demo

There is also a live demo with fake data available at <http://demo.helpy.io>
Admin User: `admin@test.com` and password: `12345678`

# Installation

Helpy was designed to run on modern cloud providers, although it should work on
any linux based system. There is a full guide to installing Helpy in the wiki: <https://github.com/helpyio/helpy/wiki>

Requirements are:

* Ruby 2.4+
* Rails 4.2.x
* Postgres
* A server like Unicorn, Puma or Passenger

Helpy leverages two external services to help out:

* an email provider like Sendgrid
* Google Analytics for stats (optional)

# Contributing

Welcome, and thanks for contributing to Helpy. Together we are building the best customer support platform in the world. Here are some of the ways you can contribute:

* Report or fix Bugs
* Refactoring
* Improve test coverage- As with any large and growing codebase, test coverage is not always as good as it could be. Help improving test coverage is always welcome and will help you learn how Helpy works. We use Minitest exclusively.
* Translate the project- The community has already translated Helpy into 18 languages, but there are many more waiting. We need help getting Helpy translated into as many locales as possible! [Please see the guide to translation](https://github.com/helpyio/helpy/wiki/How-to-translate-Helpy-into-your-language) for more details.
* Build new features. There is a backlog of new features that we’d like to see built. Check out our [roadmap](https://trello.com/b/NuiWsdmK/helpy) for more insight on this, and if you would like to take one on, please get in touch with us to make sure someone is not already working on it.

**General Guidelines:**

* Join us on Slack. Let me know you wish to contribute. [![Slack Status](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/65ea140b33651902eb91ad0672aed3236a4a2fd88bd9a0eae24d2db5df6708b8/68747470733a2f2f68656c7079696f736c61636b696e2e6865726f6b756170702e636f6d2f62616467652e737667)](https://helpyioslackin.herokuapp.com)
* Make your PRs granular. They should only include one piece of functionality per PR.
* Check the roadmap: [Trello](https://trello.com/b/NuiWsdmK/helpy) If you want to build a feature, contact us to make sure no one else is already working on it
* You must provide passing test coverage. We use minitest, see <http://www.rubypigeon.com/posts/minitest-cheat-sheet/?utm_source=rubyweekly&utm_medium=email>
* You also must expose functionality to the API. We use Grape. API methods should be tested as well.
* If your feature/bug fix/enhancement adds or changes text in the project, please create i18n strings in `en.yml` and any other locales you can.
* We are hugely concerned with user experience, and a nice UI. Oftentimes that means we may take what you have contributed and “dress it up” or ask you to do the same.

# Security Issues

If you have found a vulnerability or other security problem in Helpy, please *do not open an issue* on GitHub. Instead, contact [hello@helpy.io](mailto: hello@helpy.io) directly by email.

This release includes fixes to several serious vulnerabilities including:

[CVE-2018-18886](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-18886). This fixes a serious XSS vulnerability (Reported by [@joanbono](https://github.com/joanbono)). This was fixed in the master branch several weeks ago, but if you are running a prior version, including 1.x releases, you should upgrade to `2.2.0` as soon as possible.

Upgrades Rails to 4.2.11. This includes a fix to a significant security vulnerability in ActiveJob.

Other improvements in this release include:

* Bring dependencies up to date
* Improved support for forwarded emails
* Accept emails from users who use a number in the first part of their email or configured email name
* Correctly handle emails with no subject
* Add support for IMAP email
* Prevent agents from accessing API
* Harden agents ability to edit administrators
* Rename Login to Sign in
* Allow new users when admin creating an internal note
