- **Root cause of vulnerability**:
    - **Weakness 1**: Information disclosure about running admin sessions by sending a GET request to `/Parameters` or `/Uptime`. This returns `{"message":"#admlog#"}` if an admin session is active.
    - **Vulnerability 1**: Admin password change without authentication by sending a POST request to `/Parameters` with the new password in the JSON body. This allows changing the admin password without knowing the old password, especially if the admin session is still active (but not necessarily logged in via the web interface).
    - **Weakness 2**: Passwords are stored in plaintext and returned in a JSON object after login via the web interface.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Information disclosure of admin session status.
    - Unauthenticated password change vulnerability.
    - Password stored in plaintext.

- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - An attacker can change the admin password while the administrator is logged in (or the session is still active).
    - This locks out the original administrator.
    - The attacker gains control of the device and can arbitrarily change the phone's configuration.

- **Attack vectors**:
    - The attacker needs to be on the same network as the Gigaset Maxwell Basic phone.
    - The attack uses HTTP GET/POST requests to the phone's web interface.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker must be on the same network as the target device.
    - The attacker needs to send HTTP requests to the device's web interface.
    - The attacker does not need prior authentication or the current password if they exploit vulnerability 1 during an active admin session.
