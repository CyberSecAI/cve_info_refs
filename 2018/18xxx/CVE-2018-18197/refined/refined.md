The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in libgig version 4.1.0, which are related to the CVE.

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root cause:** Heap-buffer-overflow in `RIFF::List::GetListTypeString` due to an out-of-bounds read.
*   **Weaknesses:** Out-of-bounds read
*  **Impact:** Crash, potentially arbitrary code execution
*   **Attack Vectors:** Processing a specially crafted RIFF file.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to provide a crafted RIFF file to the application using libgig.
* **Details:** The vulnerability occurs when reading the list type string, at `src/RIFF.cpp:1536:32`.

**Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Root cause:** Out-of-bounds read in `DLS::File::GetFirstSample()`.
*   **Weaknesses:** Out-of-bounds read
*   **Impact:** Crash, potentially arbitrary code execution
*   **Attack Vectors:** Processing a specially crafted DLS file.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to provide a crafted DLS file to the application using libgig.
* **Details:** The out-of-bounds read occurs in the function at `src/DLS.cpp:1515:14` while trying to retrieve the first sample in a DLS file. The vulnerability can be triggered when the `WavePoolTableIndex` leads to an invalid offset when accessing the wave pool.

**Vulnerability 3:**

*   **Root cause:**  `operator new[]` fails due to a large allocation request in the `DLS::Sampler::Sampler(RIFF::List*)` constructor.
*   **Weaknesses:** Unchecked allocation size.
*   **Impact:** Crash due to failed allocation.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Processing a specially crafted DLS file with a large number of sample loops.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to provide a crafted DLS file to the application using libgig.
* **Details:** This vulnerability is triggered at  `src/DLS.cpp:570:51`, when `SampleLoops` variable has a very large value (2147483649), leading to allocation failure.

**Vulnerability 4:**

*   **Root cause:** Heap-buffer-overflow in `DLS::Region::GetSample()` due to an out-of-bounds read.
*   **Weaknesses:** Out-of-bounds read.
*   **Impact:** Crash, potentially arbitrary code execution
*   **Attack Vectors:** Processing a specially crafted DLS file.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to provide a crafted DLS file to the application using libgig.
* **Details:** The vulnerability occurs in `src/DLS.cpp:1052:33`, when accessing the `pWavePoolTable`.

**Vulnerability 5:**

*   **Root cause:** `operator new[]` fails due to a large allocation request in the `DLS::File::File` constructor.
*   **Weaknesses:** Unchecked allocation size.
*   **Impact:** Crash due to failed allocation
*   **Attack Vectors:** Processing a specially crafted DLS file with a large number of wave pool entries.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to provide a crafted DLS file to the application using libgig.
* **Details:** This occurs at `DLS.cpp:1462` when `WavePoolCount` has a very large value (2147483654), leading to allocation failure.

**Vulnerability 6:**

*   **Root cause:** Floating Point Exception (FPE) due to division by zero in `DLS::Sample::Sample`.
*   **Weaknesses:** Division by zero.
*    **Impact:** Crash
*   **Attack Vectors:** Processing a specially crafted DLS file with a `FrameSize` of zero.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to provide a crafted DLS file to the application using libgig.
*  **Details:** The vulnerability is present at  `DLS.cpp:743:92`. The division `pCkData->GetSize() / FrameSize` leads to division by zero when `FrameSize` is zero.
