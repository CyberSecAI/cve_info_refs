    "description": "In Teeworlds before 0.6.5, connection packets could be forged. There was no challenge-response involved in the connection build up. A remote attacker could send connection packets from a spoofed IP address and occupy all server slots, or even use them for a reflection attack using map download packets.",
    "root_cause": "Lack of challenge-response mechanism during connection establishment.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Connection packet forgery",
	  "IP address spoofing",
