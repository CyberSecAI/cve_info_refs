- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input sanitization of the `m1_extra` parameter when adding a news article.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious script code into the web page.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can lead to a variety of malicious actions, including session hijacking, defacement of the website, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable via a crafted HTTP POST request when creating a new article in the news module. The malicious payload is injected into the `m1_extra` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker must have the ability to create/add new articles, which typically requires administrative or CMS-level access. The attacker has to send a POST request to the `moduleinterface.php` file with the malicious payload injected in the `m1_extra` parameter.
