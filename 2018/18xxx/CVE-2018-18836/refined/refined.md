  "CVE-2018-18836": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The provided content describes a fix for multiple vulnerabilities in the netdata web server, including a JSON injection vulnerability.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The web server did not properly sanitize user-provided input in the URL parameters, specifically related to the Google Visualization API options. This allowed attackers to inject arbitrary JSON data into the server's response.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "JSON Injection: The web server could be forced to return a crafted JSON response by manipulating the `tqx` parameter, leading to potentially malicious JSON data being processed by other users.",
         "HTTP header injection: The URL decoding logic had a flaw that could allow crafting URLs to inject arbitrary HTTP headers, which could impact the behavior of clients.",
         "Log injection: The web server could be forced to log arbitrary data into its logs.",
         "Full Path Disclosure:  (Though this was marked as intentional) the web server disclosed the full path to files."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could craft malicious URLs that, if visited by another application user, could cause arbitrary JSON data to be processed. This could potentially lead to various malicious actions depending on how the JSON data is utilized by the client.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "The primary attack vector involves crafting a URL with malicious parameters, specifically targeting the `tqx` parameter used by the Google Visualization API, and also parameters used for HTTP header injection, and log injection.",
         "A user can be tricked into visiting a malicious URL that triggers the vulnerability"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to construct URLs with specific parameters, and trick another user into visiting that URL"
    }
