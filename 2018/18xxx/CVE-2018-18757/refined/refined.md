```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `submit_feedback.php` script. Specifically, the script directly incorporates the values of `roll_no`, `b_name`, `fac_name`, `sub_name`, `sem_name`, `batch_name`, and `division` POST parameters into an SQL query without proper sanitization.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection. The application fails to sanitize user inputs before using them in database queries.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data modification, or denial of service. In the provided POC, the attacker is attempting to extract database information (user, database, version).
- Attack vectors: HTTP POST requests to the `submit_feedback.php` script with malicious payloads in the POST parameters.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No specific privileges are required.
