Author: Jakub Palaczynski
Date: 10. July 2018
CVE: CVE-2018-18865

Affected product:
=============

Royal TS/X < Royal TS v5 Beta / Royal TSX v4 Beta

Vulnerability - Information Disclosure:
=============================

Any third party web application can steal credentials created in Royal TS/X
when browser extension is enabled.
Browser extension communicates using websockets (default TCP port 54890)
and websockets do not use any validation to verify origin of the request.
```

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Royal TS/X browser extension communicates via websockets on TCP port 54890, without any validation of the origin of requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information Disclosure, lack of origin validation on websocket connections.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious third-party web application can connect to the vulnerable websocket and retrieve stored credentials (usernames, passwords, URLs) from Royal TS/X.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious web page, loaded in a user's browser with the Royal TS/X browser extension enabled, can establish a websocket connection to the vulnerable port.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to host a malicious web page that is visited by a user with the vulnerable Royal TS/X browser extension enabled. The attacker needs no prior authentication.
