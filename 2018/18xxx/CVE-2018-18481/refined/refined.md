The provided content is related to CVE-2018-18481.

**Root Cause:** Heap-based buffer overflows occur in `io.cpp` at lines 331 and 444 due to insufficient bounds checking when reading data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability in `ReadCHAR` function at `io.cpp:331`.
- Heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability in `ReadMCHAR` function at `io.cpp:444`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Crash of the application (`cadinfo`).
- Potential for arbitrary code execution if the overflow can be controlled to overwrite adjacent memory regions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By processing a crafted DWG file that triggers the overflow conditions.
- Specifically, `poc1.dwg` triggers overflow at `io.cpp:331`, and `poc2.dwg` triggers overflow at `io.cpp:444`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious DWG file to the application.
- No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability.
