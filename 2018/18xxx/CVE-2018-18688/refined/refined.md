Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2018-18688:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance**
- The provided content explicitly mentions CVE-2018-18688 as the identifier for an "Incremental Saving Attack" (ISA) vulnerability affecting PDF signatures. The content also provides a link to the CVE page on mitre.org, confirming the relevance.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability**
- The primary root cause is the failure of PDF readers to properly validate incremental saves when verifying digital signatures. This is compounded by:
    - Vague specifications regarding signatures in the PDF standard.
    - The analyzed PDF readers being overly tolerant of malformed PDF files.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities present**
    - **Incremental Saving Attack (ISA):** This vulnerability leverages the PDF feature that allows for incremental saving of changes. It exploits the fact that some PDF processors do not correctly include maliciously added update data when validating the signature, essentially making the signature "ignorant" of the malicious changes.

**4. Impact of exploitation**
- The impact of a successful ISA attack is that an attacker can modify a signed PDF document in such a way that it is still considered valid by vulnerable PDF readers and online validation services. This can result in users trusting tampered documents.

**5. Attack vectors**
- The attack vector is through a crafted PDF file that uses the incremental saving feature to inject malicious content.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position**
   - The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious PDF document that includes both a valid signature and additional content to be included via an incremental save.
   - The attacker needs to entice a user into opening this specially crafted PDF file with a vulnerable application.

**Additional Details**

- The content provides more detail than the official CVE description by describing how the ISA attack is implemented, and provides lists of software which are vulnerable. 
- It mentions that an attacker can "trick" an unaware processor into excluding malicious update data from consideration of the signature using incremental save functionality, leading the PDF reader to report the tampered signature as valid.
- Several applications and online validation services were found vulnerable to this attack.
- The mitigation involves PAdES-conforming processors correctly accounting for incremental saves when validating signatures.
