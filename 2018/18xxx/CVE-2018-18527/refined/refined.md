The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in OwnTicket 1.0, but it is not related to the specified CVE-2018-18527. The content does not contain any information about the specified CVE, thus it is **UNRELATED**.

Here is the information regarding the SQL Injection vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. Specifically, the `showTicketId` and `editTicketStatusId` parameters in the `index.php` script are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially gaining access to sensitive data stored in the database (e.g., user credentials, ticket information) or modify/delete data in the database, or even compromise the system by further exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET requests with manipulated `showTicketId` and `editTicketStatusId` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No specific position within the network is mentioned.
