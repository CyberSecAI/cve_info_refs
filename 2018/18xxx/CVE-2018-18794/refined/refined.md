{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application lacks CSRF protection when updating admin user data.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can force a logged-in administrator to unknowingly update their account details, potentially changing the username, password, or account type.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious HTML form that, when opened by a logged-in administrator, submits a request to the vulnerable application to change the administrator's account information.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into opening a crafted HTML page (e.g., through a phishing email or malicious website) and must know the general structure of the vulnerable request. The attacker does not need direct access to the application or the server."
