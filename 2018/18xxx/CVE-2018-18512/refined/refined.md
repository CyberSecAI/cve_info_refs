  "CVE-2018-18512": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "A use-after-free vulnerability can occur while playing a sound notification in Thunderbird. The memory storing the sound data is immediately freed, although the sound is still being played asynchronously, leading to a potentially exploitable crash.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability occurs because the memory storing sound data is freed before the sound finishes playing. This happens because the `SND_ASYNC` flag is used, which causes `PlaySound` to return immediately and the data is freed without waiting for playback completion. Subsequent access to this freed memory leads to a use-after-free.",
       "vulnerabilities": [
        "Use-after-free vulnerability due to premature memory deallocation."
      ],
      "impact": "A potentially exploitable crash due to use-after-free vulnerability. This could lead to arbitrary code execution.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Playing a sound notification with a custom sound file in Thunderbird."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker would need the ability to set a custom sound file for new mail notifications in Thunderbird."
    },
    "additional_notes": "The issue is triggered by combining SND_MEMORY and SND_ASYNC flags when playing sound using PlaySound API. This was a regression introduced in a previous patch for bug 1363163. Although the `PlaySound` API is implemented in an external module (Windows), the combination of `SND_MEMORY` and `SND_ASYNC` together triggers this issue. This issue was found in Thunderbird and Firefox, but the crash was more easily reproducible in Thunderbird via custom sound notifications. The fix involves keeping the sound data alive until the next sound is played to avoid UAF."
