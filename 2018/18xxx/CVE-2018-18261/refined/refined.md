Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input in the `fcname` parameter when adding a new food category in the Waimai Super Cms.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application directly reflects the unsanitized input in the response, allowing the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful XSS attack can lead to various impacts, including:
    *   Session hijacking, allowing an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the application.
    *   Defacement of the web page.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Stealing sensitive information like cookies.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is triggered through a POST request to `/admin.php?m=Foodcat&a=addsave`.
    *   The malicious payload is embedded within the `fcname` parameter of the POST request.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.
    *   The attacker does not need to be authenticated, as this is an admin endpoint.

The provided information details how an attacker can inject JavaScript code within the `fcname` parameter to execute an XSS attack. It specifies the vulnerable URL, the necessary POST parameters, and a sample payload demonstrating the vulnerability. This information is more detailed than the typical CVE description.
