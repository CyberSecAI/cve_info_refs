Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** Improper file permissions in the installer of Intel(R) VTune Amplifier 2018 for Windows\* Update 3 and earlier versions.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The installer sets insecure file permissions, which allows unprivileged users to potentially gain elevated privileges.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An unprivileged user can escalate their privileges to gain higher access levels on the system.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Local access. An attacker needs to have local access to the system where the vulnerable software is installed.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must be a local user with low privileges. They need to have the ability to interact with the system to exploit the insecure file permissions.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Medium" severity.
*   The recommended mitigation is to update to IntelÂ® VTune Amplifier 2019 for Windows\* Update 1 or later.
*   The issue was found internally by Intel.
*   CVSS score is 4.8 with vector `CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L`
