Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2018-18762
*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of access control on the database file within SaltOS Erp Crm 3.1 r8126. The application stores its database (`saltos.db`) in a publicly accessible directory (`/files/`).
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The application directly exposes the database file (`saltos.db`) in the `/files/` directory without proper access restrictions.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** The database file contains sensitive information, such as user login credentials, which can be accessed by anyone who can access the file.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data:** An attacker can download the database file and extract sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords of the application's users.
    *   **Potential for Complete System Compromise:** If passwords are not properly hashed or salted, the attacker might be able to gain unauthorized access to the application and potentially the underlying system.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Direct File Access:** The attacker sends a GET request to the URL `/files/saltos.db` to download the database file directly from the web server.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable SaltOS instance.
    *   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability does not require any authentication. The database file is directly accessible to anyone with the URL.

**Summary of Technical Details**

The exploit code provided demonstrates how an attacker can download the `saltos.db` file using a simple HTTP GET request. The content of the database file contains sensitive information, including user logins and passwords. The provided PHP code snippet shows how an attacker could query the database for user information, illustrating the vulnerability's impact. This vulnerability constitutes a significant security risk because it allows attackers to compromise the entire SaltOS system by accessing the database directly without any authentication.
