- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A segmentation fault in the SMTP parsing logic of Suricata.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of SMTP data leading to a crash.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  A segmentation fault, leading to denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specially crafted SMTP traffic to a vulnerable Suricata instance.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a machine running Suricata and target the SMTP inspection logic.
