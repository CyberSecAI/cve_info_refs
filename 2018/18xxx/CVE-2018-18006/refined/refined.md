{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Hardcoded credentials in the Ricoh myPrint application",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Hardcoded credentials in the Android and Windows client applications.",
     "Information disclosure via WSDL web services due to the hardcoded credentials"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information by exploiting the hardcoded credentials. This includes: local paths, used mailserver details, email addresses, encrypted passwords, internal IP addresses, TCP ports of related printers/servers, Google cloud printer API secrets, print job statuses with filenames, and related organization details.",
  "Attack vectors": "Remote access to the Ricoh myPrint WSDL API.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to access a reachable Ricoh myPrint environment that has an accessible WSDL API, reverse engineer the client application to extract the hardcoded credentials, and use a SOAP tool to interact with the API."
