Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause of the vulnerability is improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the Wikidforum 2.20 application, specifically within the `select_sort`, `parent_post_id` and `num_records` parameters. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection. User-controlled parameters are directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database.
*   This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of data, or complete compromise of the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vectors involve manipulating specific POST and GET parameters:
    *   `select_sort` parameter in the search functionality
    *   `parent_post_id` parameter in `rpc.php`
    *   `num_records` parameter in `rpc.php`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   No prior authentication appears to be required for exploiting the vulnerability, though cookies are present in the examples provided

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in Wikidforum version 2.20
*   The exploit was tested on Windows 10.
*   The vendor homepage and software download link is provided.
*   The exploit is publicly available on Exploit-DB.
