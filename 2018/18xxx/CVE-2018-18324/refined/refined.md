Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2018-18324:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the lack of proper input sanitization and validation within the Centos Web Panel (CWP) version 0.9.8.480. This lack of sanitization allows attackers to inject malicious code or commands into various parameters of the application's web interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Command Injection:**
    *   The application allows execution of arbitrary commands via the `service_start`, `service_restart`, `service_fullstatus`, and `service_stop` GET parameters.
    *   By injecting shell metacharacters (e.g., `;`, `expr`) into these parameters, an attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the server.

2.  **Local File Inclusion (LFI):**
    *   The `file` parameter within the `file_editor` module is vulnerable to LFI.
    *   By using directory traversal sequences (e.g., `/../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`), an attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.

3.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) & Frame Injection:**
    *   Multiple parameters across the application are vulnerable to XSS. These include the parameters `fm_current_dir`, `module`, `service_start`, `service_fullstatus`, `service_restart`, `service_stop`, and `file`.
    *   By injecting `<script>` tags containing malicious JavaScript code, an attacker can execute arbitrary scripts within the context of a user's browser.
    *   Additionally, by injecting `<iframe>` tags pointing to external sites, attackers can perform frame injection attacks, potentially displaying malicious content within the context of the vulnerable application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Command Injection:** Full compromise of the server, including data breaches, malware deployment, and denial of service.
*   **Local File Inclusion:** Disclosure of sensitive server data such as system configuration files, user credentials, and other critical information.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:**  Execution of malicious JavaScript code leading to cookie theft, session hijacking, defacement, and redirection to malicious sites.
*   **Frame Injection:**  Display of malicious content, phishing attacks or drive-by download attacks by injecting external pages.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   All vulnerabilities are exploitable via HTTP GET requests by manipulating vulnerable parameters of the application's web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable Centos Web Panel instance.
*   The attacker can be an unauthenticated user, since no authentication is required to exploit the vulnerabilities via GET request.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The `seccops.com` content explicitly mentions CVE-2018-18322, CVE-2018-18323 and CVE-2018-18324 as being related to these vulnerabilities.
*   The `exploit-db.com` content provides proof-of-concept exploit code and HTTP request/response examples for the vulnerabilities.
