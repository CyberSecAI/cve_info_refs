Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-18655:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Prayer webmail application including a `Referer` header when a user clicks on a link within an email. This header reveals the user's username because the `header.t` template lacks a `no-referrer` setting.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the unintended disclosure of a user's username in the `Referer` header.
- **Missing Security Header:** The absence of the `no-referrer` meta tag in the `header.t` template leads to the information leak.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privacy Violation:** The most direct impact is a privacy violation. When a user clicks a link from a Prayer email, the destination website receives a `Referer` header that includes their username.
- **Potentially Personally Identifying:** This could be personally identifying, especially in cases where the username is tied to a specific individual or organization. For example, a university email system may use usernames that uniquely identify the user (e.g. `matthew@cam.ac.uk`).
- **Tracking:** The information could be used to track users across different websites, linking their browsing activity back to their specific username.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Clicking Links in Emails:** The attack vector is initiated by a user clicking on any link within an email displayed by the Prayer webmail interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **External Website Operator:** An attacker needs to be operating the destination website linked to in the email.
- **No Special Privileges:** The attacker doesn't require any special access or privileges on the Prayer mail server itself. They only need to receive the `Referer` header when a user clicks their link.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Matthew Vernon, who reported it to Debian.
- The fix involves adding `<meta name="referrer" content="no-referrer">` to the `header.t` template.
- The fix was implemented in version 1.3.5-dfsg1-5 of the prayer package.
- The blog post mentioned in the report demonstrates a real-world example where the username in the `Referer` header revealed the identity of someone visiting the blog, highlighting the potential privacy implications.
- The vulnerability affects all users of the Prayer webmail system.
