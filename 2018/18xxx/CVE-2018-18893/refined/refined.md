**Verification:**

The content directly relates to a fix for a vulnerability in the Jinjava templating engine, specifically the commit that addresses the issue of allowing `getClass()` to be called on objects. This is closely related to the information provided for CVE-2018-18893.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The Jinjava templating engine, prior to the fix, allowed the invocation of the `getClass()` method on arbitrary objects through template expressions.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The ability to call `getClass()` allows access to Java reflection capabilities.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could potentially use reflection to gain access to sensitive information, perform actions that are not intended or bypass security restrictions.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting malicious template code that includes an expression that invokes `getClass()` on a variable that references an object.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs the ability to inject template code into the Jinjava rendering process.

**Technical Details:**

*   The fix implemented in commit `c13927db0fb7bb3b567469f125be8000f8cbf601` prevents the ability to invoke `getClass()` on objects within the template engine.
*   The pull request #230 titled "do not allow calling getClass" introduced this change.

**Additional Notes:**
