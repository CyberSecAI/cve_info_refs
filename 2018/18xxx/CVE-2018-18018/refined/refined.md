Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE-2018-18018**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization and escaping of user-supplied input when handling gallery data within the Slideshow Gallery LITE WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `id` and `title` parameters associated with managing galleries are vulnerable.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The plugin is vulnerable to SQL injection because the `id` and `title` parameters of a gallery are not properly sanitized before being used in a database query.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **SQLi:** An attacker could inject arbitrary SQL queries by manipulating the `id` or `title` parameters. This could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. In the provided example, the attacker uses `SLEEP(5)` to cause a delay, demonstrating the ability to run arbitrary SQL commands.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is triggered through the `admin.php` page of the WordPress admin panel, specifically when managing slideshow galleries (`page=slideshow-galleries&method=save`).
    *   Attackers can exploit this by crafting malicious requests targeting the `Gallery[id]` or `Gallery[title]` parameters.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be authenticated and have the necessary permissions to access the `slideshow-galleries` admin page.

**Summary of Exploitation:**

An attacker can inject SQL code through the vulnerable parameters to execute arbitrary SQL queries. For example, the provided exploit uses the following:

*   `Gallery[id]=1' AND SLEEP(5) AND 'XZlZ'='XZlZ`
*   `Gallery[title]=ansa' OR SLEEP(5) AND 'jZQR'='jZQRn`

These payloads cause the database to delay for 5 seconds if successful, which helps to verify the vulnerability.

**Additional Information**

*   The blog post also mentions related vulnerabilities, CVE-2018-18017 (XSS in Manage Galleries) and CVE-2018-18019 (XSS in Manage Slides), which are not directly related to CVE-2018-18018 but are in the same plugin.
*   The vulnerable version of the plugin mentioned is 1.6.8.
*   The plugin had over 20,000 active installations at the time of the discovery.
