  "CVE-2018-18665": {
    "description": "The provided content details a vulnerability in the `mintToken` function of the NexxusToken smart contract, which can lead to an integer overflow. Specifically, the `balances` mapping and `totalSupply` variable are manipulated in a way that, when combined with large values, can cause unexpected behavior due to integer overflow.",
    "vulnerability": {
      "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the `mintToken` function.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Integer Overflow",
        "Lack of Input Validation"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker, specifically the contract owner, can arbitrarily mint tokens and set the balance of an address to a low value by exploiting the integer overflow when adding a large value to the balance. This can effectively 'zero out' an address's balance.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The contract's `mintToken` function."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be the contract owner and be able to call the `mintToken` function.",
	    "technical_details": [
		"The vulnerability lies in the line `balances[owner] += _amount;` within `mintToken`. If `_amount` is sufficiently large and when added to `balances[owner]`, an integer overflow may occur, resulting in an unexpected value for the balance and totalSupply. ",
        "The contract's code does not include any explicit checks to prevent the integer overflow. There are also no validation that the `_amount` parameter will cause an overflow."
