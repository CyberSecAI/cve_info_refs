  "cve": "CVE-2018-18957",
  "description": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in libiec61850 version 1.3 within the prepareGooseBuffer function located in goose/goose_publisher.c. This vulnerability can be triggered by providing an overly long interface identifier string, resulting in a stack smashing condition.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper bounds checking when copying the interface identifier string within the `Ethernet_getInterfaceMACAddress` function, leading to a buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow",
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
     "impact": "The vulnerability allows for a denial-of-service condition. By providing a crafted long interface identifier, an attacker can overwrite portions of the stack. This overwrite may lead to abnormal program termination due to stack corruption or other uncontrolled behavior, crashing the application.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability can be exploited by providing an overly long string as an interface identifier to the `goose_publisher_example` application."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
        "The attacker needs to be able to execute the vulnerable application and pass a command-line argument representing the interface identifier"
    ]
