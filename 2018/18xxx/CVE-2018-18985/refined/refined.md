- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of input during web page generation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an authenticated user to inject client-side scripts into some web pages, which could then be viewed by other users, potentially affecting confidentiality.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can inject code into web pages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An authenticated user is required to inject the malicious script.
