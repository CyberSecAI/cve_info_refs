Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9109:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a directory traversal flaw within the `zipdl` command of the elFinder PHP connector. Specifically, the `zipdl()` function in `elFinder.class.php` was not properly validating the file parameter, which allowed an attacker to manipulate the path and access files outside the intended directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization of the `file` parameter, allowing an attacker to use directory traversal sequences (like `../`) to navigate the file system outside of the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Download:** An attacker could download any file on the server under the PHP execution privilege by exploiting the directory traversal flaw.
- **Arbitrary File Deletion:**  The advisory also mentions an attacker could delete arbitrary files on the server, however, the provided code fix does not address deletion, so this may be a separate issue.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is carried out remotely via HTTP requests by exploiting the vulnerable `zipdl` command.
- The attacker would need to send a crafted request to the `zipdl` function with a manipulated `file` parameter to perform directory traversal.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the server running the vulnerable elFinder instance.
- **Authentication:** According to the CVSS vector, the attacker requires low privileges (`PR:L`) which suggests that the attacker would need to be authenticated as a user with access to elFinder to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of elFinder API:** The attacker would need knowledge of the `zipdl` command and its parameters to craft a malicious request.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided patch adds a check to ensure that the `file` parameter does not contain directory separators, preventing traversal.
- The fix implemented is a check using `strpos` on `$file` for `DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR` after converting forward slashes to `DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR`.
- The vulnerability was present in elFinder versions 2.1.12 to 2.1.35 and 2.1.36 on Windows servers.
