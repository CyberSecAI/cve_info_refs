```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input validation in the `cgiServer.exx` script, which allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary file path through the `page` parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files from the file system of the affected device, potentially gaining access to sensitive information such as configuration files, password hashes, and other system data. In the provided example, the attacker was able to retrieve the `/etc/shadow` file containing password hashes.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the `cgiServer.exx` script, providing the path to the target file in the `page` parameter. This is done through a web interface.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have network access to the device and valid administrative credentials to authenticate to the web interface of the Intelbras IP Phone. In this case, the default 'admin:admin' credentials were used."
