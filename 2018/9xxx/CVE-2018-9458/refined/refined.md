  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2018-9458",
    "description": "The provided text indicates that a fix was made to prevent a secondary display from gaining focus when the keyboard is up. Input intended for the keyboard could end up going to a different display. The fix ensures that only the default display can get focus when the keyboard is showing.",
    "root_cause": "Improper focus management when the keyboard is displayed on a device with multiple displays. Input events could be routed to the wrong display.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect input routing",
      "Lack of proper focus control across multiple displays"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially redirect user input to an unintended display while the keyboard is in use. This may lead to information disclosure, unintended actions, or denial of service if the secondary display does not handle input correctly.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious application triggering keyboard input while a secondary display is active"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "A malicious application with the ability to trigger keyboard input while a secondary display is active."
  }
