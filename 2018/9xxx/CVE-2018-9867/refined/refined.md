Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-9867:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   Improper access control in SonicOS allows authenticated, unprivileged users to download imported certificates via HTTP requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Inadequate Authorization:** The system fails to properly verify user permissions before allowing access to certificate download functionality.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Certificates intended to be protected are exposed to unauthorized users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Confidentiality Breach:**  Sensitive certificate data can be accessed by unauthorized users.
*   Compromised certificates could be used to impersonate services/devices.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **HTTP Request:** A specially crafted HTTP request, including a valid session ID, allows download of certificates using a URL containing the certificate name.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user, although they do not require full administrative privileges.
*   **Network Access:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the SonicOS device.
*  **Knowledge of Certificate Name:** The attacker needs to know the certificate's file name, given the attack is done by requesting a certificate by its filename.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in SonicOS Gen 5 version 5.9.1.10 and earlier, Gen 6 version 6.2.7.3, 6.5.1.3, 6.5.2.2, 6.5.3.1, 6.2.7.8, 6.4.0.0, 6.5.1.8, 6.0.5.3-86o and SonicOSv 6.5.0.2-8v\_RC363 (VMWARE), 6.5.0.2.8v\_RC367 (AZURE), SonicOSv 6.5.0.2.8v\_RC368 (AWS), SonicOSv 6.5.0.2.8v\_RC366 (HYPER\_V).
