Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9846:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-controlled input (`$uids`) when processing archive operations in Roundcube's "archive" plugin. Specifically, the `move_messages` function in `archive.php` does not properly sanitize the `$uids` parameter when the archive folder is a special one (author, date etc) which leads to the execution of the vulnerable code branch.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

1.  **IMAP command injection:** The `$uids` parameter is passed unsanitized to the `fetch` function in `rcube_imap_generic.php`, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary IMAP commands.
2.  **Bypass of security check:** The `check_request()` function, intended to prevent CSRF attacks, is bypassed because `rcmail::get_uids()` fetches the `_uids` parameter using `INPUT_GPC`, effectively allowing the attacker to pass it via a GET request instead of POST. This leads to the request being treated as a POST request with empty `$_POST`, bypassing the token validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject arbitrary IMAP commands, which could lead to various malicious actions, such as:
    *   Deleting emails
    *   Creating new mailboxes
    *   Fetching emails
    *   Potentially other IMAP server-specific actions, as the injected commands are passed directly to the IMAP server.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via a crafted HTTP request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable Roundcube instance.
*   For older versions (e.g., 1.2.0), the attacker can trick a user into clicking a malicious link.
*   For newer versions, the attacker may need to bypass the Same-Origin Policy (SOP) if AJAX requests are enforced.
*  The "archive" plugin must be enabled and configured on the Roundcube instance.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was found in Roundcube versions 1.2.0 to 1.3.5.
*   The issue was addressed in version 1.2.3+dfsg.1-4+deb9u2 for Debian's "stretch" distribution.
* The reported also identified a theoretical PHP type juggling issue in `rcube.php:check_request()` due to the use of loose comparison (`==` and `!=`) instead of strict comparisons (`===` and `!==`). This was not directly exploitable at the time due to the use of HTTP parameters which are always strings.
*  The fix involves sanitizing the user-controlled input to prevent IMAP injection, as well as addressing the bypass of the `check_request()` function.
