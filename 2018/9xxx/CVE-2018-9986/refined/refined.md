- **Root cause of vulnerability**:  The frontend markdown processor had an XSS vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: XSS (Cross-Site Scripting).
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability exists within the frontend markdown processor. By crafting specific markdown that contains malicious scripts, an attacker can cause the script to execute when a user views the crafted markdown.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be able to submit/inject the malicious markdown into a place where it is processed and viewed by other users, or the user themselves.
