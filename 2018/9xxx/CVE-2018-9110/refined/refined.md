Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-9110:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a directory traversal issue present in the `zipdl` command within the PHP connector of elFinder. This occurs due to insufficient validation of the file parameter, allowing an attacker to manipulate the path and access files outside of the intended directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization, which allows directory traversal by manipulating the `file` parameter. Specifically, the vulnerability exists because the code does not properly handle directory separators (both `/` and `\` depending on the OS) when constructing the file path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **File Download:** An attacker can download any file on the server that the PHP process has access to.
- **File Deletion:**  While not explicitly described, access to files also means that an attacker could potentially delete files, since they can specify the path.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious request to the `zipdl` command with a manipulated `file` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the elFinder application.
- The attacker needs to know (or guess) a valid path on the system to access arbitrary files.
- The attacker requires low privileges (PR:L), since a valid user session is required to issue commands.
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the file parameter (UI:N)

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable versions are elFinder 2.1.12 to 2.1.35, and 2.1.36 on Windows servers.
- The vulnerability is fixed in versions 2.1.36 (for windows) and 2.1.37 and higher.
- The fix involves adding a check to the `zipdl()` function to ensure the file parameter does not contain directory separators after being normalized.

**CVSS Score:**
- CVSS Score: 7.7
- CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N
