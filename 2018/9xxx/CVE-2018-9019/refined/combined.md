WARNING:
If you enabled (for test) the experimental BlockedLog module before 7.0, you must purge the table llx\_blockedlog becauseway to save data for final version has changed.
Following changes may create regressions for some external modules, but were necessary to make Dolibarr better:\* The methode "cloture" on contract were renamed into "closeAll".\* The method "is\_erasable" of invoice return a value <= 0 if not erasable (value is meaning) instead of always 0. \* The substitution key for reference of objects is now \_\_REF\_\_ whatever is the object (it replaces \_\_ORDERREF\_\_,  \_\_PROPALREF\_\_, ...)\* The substition key \_\_SIGNATURE\_\_ was renamed into \_\_USER\_SIGNATURE\_\_ to follow naming conventions. \* Substitution keys with syntax %XXX% were renamed into \_\_XXX\_\_ to match others.\* Removed old deprecated REST API (APIs found into '/root' section of the REST API explorer in Dolibarr v6).\* Some REST API to access setup features, like dictionaries (country, town, extrafields, ...) were moved into a  common API "/setup".\* The REST API /documents were renamed into /documents/download and /documents/upload. \* Page bank/index.php, bank/bankentries.php and comm/actions/listactions.php were renamed into  bank/list.php, bank/bankentries\_list.php and comm/actions/list.php to follow page naming conventions (so default filter/sort order features can also work for this pages).\* The trigger ORDER\_SUPPLIER\_STATUS\_ONPROCESS was renamed into ORDER\_SUPPLIER\_STATUS\_ORDERED.\* The trigger ORDER\_SUPPLIER\_STATUS\_RECEIVED\_ALL was renamed into ORDER\_SUPPLIER\_STATUS\_RECEIVED\_COMPLETELY.\* The parameter note into method cloture() is added at end of private note (previously in v6, it replaced).\* The parameter $user is now mandatory for method createFromOrder and createFromPropal.\* Removed js library 'fileupload' that was not used by core code.\* Jquery plugin tableDnd updated. You now need to use decodeURI on the return value of tableDnDSerialize()  and add 'td.' to the beginning of the dragHandle match string. \* IE8 and earlier and Firefox 12 and earlier (< 2012) are no more supported. \* The module ExpenseReport use numbering rules that you can setup (like other modules do). If you need to  keep the hard coded numbering rule of expenses report used in 6.0, just add constant EXPENSEREPORT\_USE\_OLD\_NUMBERING\_RULE to 1.\* If you use the external module "multicompany", you must also upgrade the module. Multicompany module for Dolibarr v7 is required because with Dolibarr v7, payment modes and payment conditions are management as data that are dedicated to each company. If you keep your old version of multicompany module, mode and condition of payments will appears empty in all companies that are not the first one. By upgrading the  multicompany module to a version that support Dolibarr v7, everything should work as expected.

WARNING:
Following changes may create regression for some external modules, but were necessary to make Dolibarr better:\* The hook getNodeList has been replaced by a normalized 'addreplace' hook getDirList.\* The trigger USER\_SETINGROUP and USER\_REMOVEFROMGROUP has been replaced with trigger USER\_MODIFY.\* The page societe/soc.php was renamed into societe/card.php to match page naming conventions.\* The page compta/facture.php was renamed into compta/facture/card.php to match page naming conventions.\* The signature of method ->delete() of class Product and PriceExpression was changed from  ->delete(id, notrigger) to ->delete(User, notrigger) to match standard dev rules.\* The signature of method ->delete() of class Adherent was changed from  ->delete(id) to ->delete(id, User, notrigger) to match standard dev rules.\* Removed CommonObject::displayMarginInfos (was deprecated in 3.8). Use same method into html.formmargin.class.php\* Removed Societe::set\_commnucation\_level (was deprecated in 4.0). Was not used.\* Removed the trigger file of PAYPAL module that stored data that was not used by Dolibarr. The trigger event still exists, but if an external module need action on it, it must provides itself its trigger file.\* Use $conf->global->MULTICOMPANY\_TRANSVERSE\_MODE instead $conf->multicompany->transverse\_mode. So, if you set var $multicompany\_transverse\_mode to 1 into your conf file, you must remove this line and a new key into  the Home - setup - other admin page.\* If you use Multicompany transverse mode, it will be necessary to check the activation of the modules in the children entities and to review completely the rights of the groups and the users.\* Use getEntity('xxx') instead getEntity('xxx', 1) and use getEntity('xxx', 0) instead getEntity('xxx')\* Some other change were done in the way we read permission of a user when module multicompany is enabled. You can  retreive the old behavior by adding constant MULTICOMPANY\_BACKWARD\_COMPATIBILITY to 1.\* The hook formObjectOptions was not implemented correctly in previous version. Sometimes, you had to return output content by doing a print into function, sometimes by returning content into "resprint". This has been fixed to followhook specifications so you must return output into "resprint".

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 329 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [January 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2739494.1).

**Please note that since the release of the October 2020 Critical Patch Update, Oracle has released a Security Alert for Oracle WebLogic Server: [CVE-2020-14750 (November 1, 2020)](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2020-14750.html). Customers are strongly advised to apply this Critical Patch Update, which includes patches for this Alert as well as additional patches.**

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components which are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.
