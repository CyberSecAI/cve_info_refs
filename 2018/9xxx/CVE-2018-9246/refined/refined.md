- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient sanitization or escaping of variable values used in shell command execution.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Shell code injection vulnerability due to inadequate sanitization of arguments passed to external programs.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the running application.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation is possible through the `create()`, `run_file()`, `backup()`, and `restore()` functions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to influence the variable values used by the vulnerable functions.
