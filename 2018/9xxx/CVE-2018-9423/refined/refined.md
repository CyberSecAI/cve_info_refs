Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9423:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of parameters related to short_term_ref_pic_sets and long_term_ref_pics_sps within the libhevc library. Specifically, when num_short_term_ref_pic_sets or num_long_term_ref_pics_sps in the Sequence Parameter Set (SPS) are out of range, an error should be returned.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The vulnerability arises because the library doesn't properly check if the number of short-term or long-term reference picture sets are within allowed boundaries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Information Disclosure (ID):** The provided text indicates that this vulnerability leads to information disclosure and is classified as moderate severity. The specific type of information leaked isn't detailed, but it could potentially expose sensitive data through a malformed HEVC stream.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   The attack vector involves processing a maliciously crafted HEVC bitstream that contains out-of-range values for num_short_term_ref_pic_sets or num_long_term_ref_pics_sps in the SPS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   An attacker would need to be able to provide the vulnerable system with a crafted HEVC bitstream. This could be achieved through various means depending on how the HEVC library is used (e.g., malicious media files, network streaming, etc.)

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for the vulnerability involves adding a check to return an error when the `num_short_term_ref_pic_sets` or `num_long_term_ref_pics_sps` parameters in the SPS are out of range.
- This vulnerability is reported as affecting Android versions 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, and 8.1.
- The commit messages provide additional context indicating that this fix was cherry-picked from another commit, indicating it was a necessary patch to address this specific vulnerability.
