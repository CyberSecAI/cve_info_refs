Based on the provided article, here's the information related to CVE-2018-9311:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The article mentions a "backdoor" in the infotainment unit which allows a USB connection to bypass the infotainment system and access the vehicle's K-CAN bus. This backdoor could be due to an admin account with no password, a default password, or hardcoded credentials. The specific implementation is not detailed.
- Additionally, the article mentions a vulnerability in the infotainment unit where some Texas Instruments code used for the Jacinto chip to send CAN messages was reused.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Backdoor in the infotainment unit.
- Insufficient input validation or access controls that allows an attacker to inject messages into the CAN bus.
- Lack of proper security for diagnostic functions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject messages into the vehicle's CAN bus and engine control unit, potentially allowing them to take over or interfere with the operation of the vehicle.
- Remote code execution in the telematics control unit firmware can be achieved by bypassing signature protection
- Attackers can send arbitrary diagnostic messages to the ECUs.
- Attackers can gain access from the CAN bus to the K-CAN bus.
- The attacker can wirelessly hijack the car's hardware via the cellular network and Bluetooth
- Trigger BMW Remote Services with arbitrary messages though a simulated GSM network.

**Attack vectors:**
- Physical USB access through the infotainment unit's USB port.
- Remote access via Bluetooth.
- Remote access via the cellular phone network.
- Physical or indirect access to the car.
- Exploitation through a simulated GSM network

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Physical access to the vehicle's USB port.
- Ability to connect to the vehicle's Bluetooth or cellular network.
- The attacker may need to use reverse engineering techniques to exploit vulnerabilities.
- Ability to simulate a GSM network to exploit the telematics control unit.
