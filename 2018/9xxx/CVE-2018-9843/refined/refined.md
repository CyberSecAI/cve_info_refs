Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-9843

**Root Cause:** The CyberArk Password Vault Web Access application uses authentication tokens that are serialized .NET objects. The application does not properly validate the integrity of these serialized objects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **Insecure Deserialization:** The application deserializes .NET objects from the authentication token without proper integrity checks. This allows an attacker to inject malicious serialized objects.
* **Lack of Authentication:** Although the API is intended to require authentication, this vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass it using manipulated tokens.
* **Use of Base64 Encoding:** Base64 encoding is used but does not provide any integrity protection of serialized data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By injecting a malicious .NET object, an attacker can achieve unauthenticated remote code execution on the web server hosting the CyberArk Password Vault Web Access application.
* **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker gains access with the privileges of the web application, which can be further leveraged to compromise the application or other resources.
* **Data Breach:** The attacker could potentially access and steal credentials stored in the vault and pivot from the webserver to attack the vault directly.
* **Backdooring:** The attacker could backdoor the web application for persistent access and further compromise accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious serialized .NET object and includes it in the "Authorization" header of an HTTP request to the web application's REST API.
* **REST API Vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists within the `/PasswordVault/WebServices/` API endpoint of the CyberArk Password Vault Web Access application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Network Accessibility:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable CyberArk Password Vault Web Access application's web server. No prior authentication is needed for exploitation.
* **ysoserial.net or equivalent:** The attacker needs tools to create malicious serialized .NET objects (e.g., ysoserial.net)

**Additional Details:**
* **Affected Versions:** CyberArk Password Vault Web Access versions prior to 9.9.5, 9.10.1, and 10.1 are vulnerable.
* **Fixed Versions:** Upgrading to versions 9.9.5, 9.10.1, or 10.2 resolves the issue.
* **Proof of Concept (PoC):** A detailed PoC was provided, demonstrating the injection of a malicious serialized .NET object to execute a ping command, which confirms the RCE vulnerability.
* **Workaround:** Disabling access to the `/PasswordVault/WebServices/` API route can mitigate the vulnerability.
