{
  "CVE-2018-9338": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is related to the handling of attacker-modified size and data fields passed to `ResStringPool::setTo()`. These modified fields are not normally generated by AAPT, indicating an attempt to inject malicious data through a crafted APK.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper input validation of size and data fields in `ResStringPool::setTo()`",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Bypassing of security measures put in place to prevent installation of modified APKs. The vulnerability, if exploited, would allow an attacker to install modified applications by bypassing the integrity checks performed during installation.",
    "Attack vectors": "Modified APKs crafted with altered size and data fields in the `ResStringPool`.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to create a modified APK with specific changes in the string pool. This could be done by manipulating the APK file before installation, typically requiring a position that allows for replacing or modifying application files before they are installed."
