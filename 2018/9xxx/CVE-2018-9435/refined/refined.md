    {
      "cve": "CVE-2018-9435",
      "root_cause": "The commit message indicates a potential issue when handling a 'too short' error response in the GATTT layer of the Bluetooth stack. It mentions that the specification is unclear on how to handle this specific case, and thus, a reserved error code is used, and the error is passed to upper layers.",

        "Improper error handling"
      ],
      "impact": "The provided information doesn't describe the specific impact of this vulnerability. The text indicates that the error is passed to upper layers which suggests a possibility of denial of service or unexpected behavior.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is within the Bluetooth stack, specifically during the handling of GATTT error responses.",
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would likely need to interact with the vulnerable device via Bluetooth, likely through GATT operations."
