The same to the current master branch in binutils git repo. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=23008#c1)  Nick Clifton    2018-03-28 09:49:06 UTC  ``` Hi Dongliang,    Sorry - I am unable to reproduce this bug, even using 2.29 and/or the   2.30 branch sources.    Are you running on a machine with a small amount of memory ?  Or maybe   you have a stack limit set ?    Also I should note that since this problem appears to be associated with   the C++ demangling functions provided by the libiberty library, you may   want to report the problem on the GCC bugzilla system.  (The libiberty   library is maintained by GCC, rather than by binutils).  Cheers   Nick ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=23008#c2)  Dongliang Mu    2018-03-28 15:02:57 UTC  ``` Hi Nick,  first let me show my concrete instructions to convince you it is reproducible.

The difference was that I used "CC=gcc" rather than "CC=clang".  I did try using clang, but it would not run with the -fsanitize=address option. Possibly something to do with the sanitization libraries that I have installed on my machine.  Anyway - it looks like you have stumbled across a clang bug.  If possible, please could you check that compiling with gcc does work for you, and if so, please can you report this problem to the clang developers ?

Change your configure command line so that LDLFLAGS is defined as:    LDFLAGS="-fsanitize=address -ldl"  That should fix the problem.  Cheers   Nick ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=23008#c8)  H.J.

Now I will try to report this bug in GCC Bugzilla.  Finally, thanks for your good work, Nick. ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=23008#c11)  Michael Matz    2018-04-04 12:59:10 UTC  ``` All seems to work as designed.  The testcase contains a large number of 'F' characters, and demangling each one of them entails:  5  0x00000000005ec0f8 in demangle_nested_args (work=0x7fffffffd540, mangled=0x7fffffffd2a0,      declp=0x7fffff800050) at ../../libiberty/cplus-dem.c:4713 4713      result = demangle_args (work, mangled, declp); #4  0x00000000005ea8f9 in demangle_args (work=0x7fffffffd540, mangled=0x7fffffffd2a0, declp=0x7fffff800050)     at ../../libiberty/cplus-dem.c:4659 4659              if (!do_arg (work, mangled, &arg)) #3  0x00000000005eb99e in do_arg (work=0x7fffffffd540, mangled=0x7fffffffd2a0, result=0x7fffff7ffbe0)     at ../../libiberty/cplus-dem.c:4332 4332      if (!do_type (work, mangled, work->previous_argument)) #2  0x00000000005cbf15 in do_type (work=0x7fffffffd540, mangled=0x7fffffffd2a0, result=0x6030000318d0)     at ../../libiberty/cplus-dem.c:3719 3719              if (!demangle_nested_args (work, mangled, &decl) #1  0x00000000005ec0f8 in demangle_nested_args (work=0x7fffffffd540, mangled=0x7fffffffd2a0,      declp=0x7fffff7ff370) at ../../libiberty/cplus-dem.c:4713 4713      result = demangle_args (work, mangled, declp);  That progresses *mangled by one character.  When compiled with clang, the above sequence of five calls needs 3296 bytes on the stack.  The testcase contains more than 2542 'F' characters in a row, and together that needs more than 8MB of stack, leading to the abort.  When compiled with GCC -fsanitize-address the above sequence only needs 912 bytes on stack (per 'F' character), so it progresses until  (gdb) p *mangled $10 = 0x78b6cc <mbuffer+9196> 'F' <repeats 200 times>... before segfaulting due to stack overflow (with clang it only gets until mbuffer+2550).  When compiled without sanitizer (with GCC) the above sequence of calls only needs 400 bytes per stack.  The testcase contains 11586 'F' characters, so that is within the normal stack limit and no problem occurs.  If the compiler is more clever (the above is with gcc-6 and -O0) then the sequence of calls will need less stack space, and hence not reproduce the problem.  I'm not sure if anything needs fixing, the demangler works as designed, you ask it to demangle a nested structure that's 11000 levels deep, and a stack overflow occurs.  As expected. ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=23008#c12)  yuanwu    2018-05-04 01:33:04 UTC  ``` Hi Dongliang,   my question is "Does this vulnerability affects binutils 2.26 ".  so I run your test program in Binutils version 2.26 ,the program result has no stack-overflow.    but using 2.29 branch sources，the program result also has no stack-overflow (I am unable to reproduce this bug with the same linux system as you). so I am not sure whether this vulnerability affects binutils 2.26.

# USN-4326-1: libiberty vulnerabilities

8 April 2020

Several security issues were fixed in libiberty.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [libiberty](/security/cves?package=libiberty) - library of utility functions used by GNU programs

## Details

It was discovered that libiberty incorrectly handled parsing certain

binaries. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a

specially crafted binary, a remote attacker could use this issue to cause

libiberty to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute

arbitrary code
