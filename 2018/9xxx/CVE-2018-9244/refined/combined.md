# Persistent XSS in milestones data-milestone-id attribute when payload is using HTML-entities

The `milestone_select.js` located in `app/assets/javascripts/milestone_select.js` suffers from a stored XSS issue in the `renderRow`-function. The issue is that the `data-milestone-id`-attribute is containing the name of the milestone, but is not sanitized properly:

The issue is currently on line [#98 (closed)](/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/issues/98 "Repo Mirror: Gitlab project creation page hangs on cloning from invalid git repository"):
<https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/milestone_select.js#L98>

```
        renderRow: milestone => `
          <li data-milestone-id="${milestone.name}">
            <a href='#' class='dropdown-menu-milestone-link'>
              ${_.escape(milestone.title)}
            </a>
          </li>
        `,
```

As you see, the title is escaped but the name is not, but they are the same really:

[![Screen_Shot_2018-01-08_at_21.30.20](data:image/gif;base64...)](/-/project/13083/uploads/b81223c50c1acf69d663e7e0958c1a74/Screen_Shot_2018-01-08_at_21.30.20.png)

Now, this is not possible to do with normal angle-brackets, however, due to the passing of data, using HTML-entities for the payload will trigger this issue when creating a Milestone with the following name:

```
'">&lt;img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)&gt;
```

This seems to be some form of issue with it server side, as the `milestones.json` actually contains escaped real angle-bracket characters:

```
"name":"'\"\u003e\u003cimg src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)\u003e"
```

### PoC

1. Create a new milestone at: `/project-name/milestones`
2. Name the milestone:
   ```
   '">&lt;img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)&gt;
   ``` ![Screen_Shot_2018-01-08_at_20.38.36](/uploads/02c2e340e48d5a954b6966cce471d8e7/Screen_Shot_2018-01-08_at_20.38.36.png)
   ```
3. Save, now go to `/project-name/issues`, press `New issue`
4. Click on the Milestone-selector: [![Screen_Shot_2018-01-08_at_20.38.46](data:image/gif;base64...)](/-/project/13083/uploads/a817a229676c9293366fe142f61eb0e3/Screen_Shot_2018-01-08_at_20.38.46.png) the javascript will trigger: [![Screen_Shot_2018-01-08_at_20.39.27](data:image/gif;base64...)](/-/project/13083/uploads/5a5f0d957147cd5541e8f6d14fde71bf/Screen_Shot_2018-01-08_at_20.39.27.png) [![Screen_Shot_2018-01-08_at_20.39.35](data:image/gif;base64...)](/-/project/13083/uploads/06cdf20484c28c6e2eb889f8a0b2dc0a/Screen_Shot_2018-01-08_at_20.39.35.png)

This happens on every place where the milestone-selector exists, it's all over the app.

## Impact

The stored XSS is triggering for anyone, also triggering on `gitlab.com`, and it can trigger on public repos. You could easily build a PoC that would modify the email address of the current user stealing their CSRF-token as soon as the script triggers.
