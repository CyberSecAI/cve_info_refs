- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `milestone_select.js` uses the milestone name to populate the `data-milestone-id` attribute of a list item without proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of sanitization of user-supplied milestone names in the `data-milestone-id` attribute within the `renderRow` function of `milestone_select.js`.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to:
  - Stealing user cookies and session tokens.
  - Modifying the user's account settings.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the victim.
  - Defacing web pages.
- **Attack vectors**:
  - An attacker creates a milestone with a specially crafted name containing HTML entities that will resolve to malicious JavaScript.
  - When a user views a page that uses the milestone selector (e.g., creating an issue), the malicious JavaScript executes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to create or edit milestones. The vulnerability is triggered when other users interact with a milestone selector that contains the malicious milestone.
