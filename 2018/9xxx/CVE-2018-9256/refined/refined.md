Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9256:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the LWAPP (Lightweight Access Point Protocol) dissector in Wireshark. A malformed LWAPP packet, specifically a crafted Layer 3 packet, can cause a stack overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack overflow due to insufficient bounds checking or improper handling of malformed LWAPP packets. The dissector attempts to process the malformed packet, which leads to a buffer overflow on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash:** The primary impact is the crashing of the Wireshark application.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By injecting a malformed packet or convincing a user to open a malicious capture file, an attacker can cause Wireshark to become unresponsive, effectively denying service to the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Injection:** An attacker can inject a malformed LWAPP packet onto a network.
- **Malicious Capture File:** An attacker can create a malicious packet capture file containing the crafted LWAPP packet and trick a user into opening it with Wireshark.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be in a position to inject packets on a network segment where Wireshark is capturing traffic.
- **Social Engineering:** Alternatively, the attacker needs to be able to convince a Wireshark user to open a malicious capture file.
- **Knowledge of LWAPP protocol:** While not explicitly stated, the attacker would need knowledge of the LWAPP protocol to create a malformed packet triggering the vulnerability.
