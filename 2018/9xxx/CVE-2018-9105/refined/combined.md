### [VS-2018-015] NordVPN for MacOS Root Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

#### CVE ID

CVE-2018-9105

#### CVSS Score

Pending

#### Vendor

NordVPN

#### Product

NordVPN for MacOS

#### Product Version

3.3.10

#### Vulnerability Details

NordVPN for MacOS suffers from a root privilege escalation vulnerability. The vulnerability stems from its privileged helper tool's implemented XPC service. This XPC service is responsible for receiving and processing new **openvpn** connection requests from the main application. Unfortunately this XPC service is not protected, which allows arbitrary applications to connect and send it potentially malicious XPC messages. An attacker can send a crafted XPC message to the privileged helper tool requesting it to make a new **openvpn** connection. Because he or she controls the contents of the XPC message, the attacker can specify the location of the **openvpn** executable, which could point to something malicious they control located on disk. Without validation of **openvpn** executable, this will give the attacker code execution in the context of the privileged helper tool, which is running as root.

#### Vendor Response

NordVPN has released an update.
