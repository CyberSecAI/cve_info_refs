Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9563:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read in the `llcp` (Logical Link Control Protocol) code, specifically during part 2 of its execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Out-of-bounds read: The code attempts to access memory locations outside of the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Information Disclosure: An attacker could potentially read sensitive information from memory by exploiting the out-of-bounds read.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the NFC (Near Field Communication) stack, specifically within the `llcp` implementation. An attacker would likely need to manipulate NFC communications or data to trigger this out-of-bounds read during the card emulation or tag read/write processes.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs the capability to interact with the NFC functionality of the targeted device. This may involve physical proximity and sending crafted NFC messages or data.

**Additional notes**
The provided content mentions "Tag read/write" and "Card Emulation" which seem to be attack vectors. The fix was implemented in `llcp_util.cc` and `llcp_link.cc`. The commit messages also mention that this patch fixes OOB (out-of-bounds) issues. The information from the security bulletin also confirms that CVE-2018-9563 is an Information Disclosure vulnerability.
