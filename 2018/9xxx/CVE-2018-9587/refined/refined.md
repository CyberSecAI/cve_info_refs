Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9587:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper handling of "file://" URIs during contact photo editing, specifically when saving a photo. Malicious apps could potentially exploit this by providing a "file://" URI that points to private files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **URI Handling Vulnerability:** The contact photo editing feature does not adequately validate the "file://" URI provided to it for saving operations. This allows an attacker to attempt to read arbitrary files on the device by crafting a malicious "file://" URI.
- **Bypass of Access Control:** The photo saving process copies the file from the provided URI into a temporary "content://" URI. This temporary URI is then given to a cropping app (with read permission) which could be exploited to read files the app does not normally have access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can gain unauthorized read access to private files on the user's device that the attacker's application would not normally have permissions for. Specifically, the attacker could read files from shared preferences or other private file locations.
- **Data Exfiltration:** The attacker, having read the private file, could exfiltrate sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious App:** A malicious application can be crafted to initiate the contact photo editing flow.
- **Crafted URI:**  The malicious app would pass a specifically crafted "file://" URI pointing to a private file it wishes to access during the photo saving process.
- **Photo Editing Flow:** The vulnerability lies in the contact photo editing and saving process, where a crafted URI can be used to gain read access to private files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Installed Malicious App:** The attacker must have a malicious app installed on the target device.
- **User Interaction:** The user must initiate the contact photo editing flow with the malicious app's crafted URI.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability is patched in `PhotoSelectionHandler.java` and `AttachPhotoActivity.java`.
*   The fix prevents reading of "file://" URIs that do not point to the "/storage" directory.
*   The provided commit message indicates a test case involving a "fake gallery app" and trying to read a shared preference file. This test case demonstrates the specific vulnerability.
*   The issue is documented with bug ID 113597344
*   The CVE description in the security bulletin describes it as an "Elevation of Privilege" (EoP) vulnerability which is accurate given the context.
*   The severity is rated as "High"

In summary, CVE-2018-9587 is an Elevation of Privilege vulnerability that allows a malicious app to read private files by crafting a malicious URI, due to improper URI handling in the photo editing process.
