Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9245:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Ericsson-LG iPECS NMS A.1Ac login portal is vulnerable to SQL injection. Specifically, the "id" and "passwd" parameters in the login form are susceptible to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the presence of SQL injection flaws in the login functionality of the application.
- **Cleartext Credential Disclosure:**  The application also discloses sensitive information such as database and NMS login credentials in cleartext due to incorrect access controls.
- **Incorrect access control:** The application fails to properly control access to sensitive information, allowing for the disclosure of credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability, an unauthenticated attacker can bypass the login and achieve remote code execution on the underlying operating system.
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** The attacker can obtain cleartext database credentials and NMS login credentials, which can lead to further compromise.
- **MiTM Attacks:** The system is also described as vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle attacks, but no specific details about this are provided.
- **Bypassing Authentication:** The SQL injection allows attackers to bypass the login page entirely, accessing the system without valid credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is sending a POST request to the login page (`/nms/php/module/main/main_login.php`) with malicious SQL injection payloads in the "id" and "passwd" parameters.
- Attackers do not need prior authentication to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability.
- The cleartext credential disclosure is achieved by sending a POST request to `/nms/php/module/main/main_start.php` with specific parameters.
- The extraction of admin credentials is done through a POST request to `/nms/php/module/init/module_init.php`, leveraging previously obtained database credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable iPECS NMS instance.
- No prior authentication is required to exploit the SQL injection and bypass the login.
- The attacker must have the ability to send HTTP POST requests with crafted data.
- The attacker must be able to interact with the HTTP interface of the web server.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vendor was notified, but no direct response was received.
- The product is a paid product and not freely available for download for testing.
- The exploit script provided automates the process of bypassing login, dumping database credentials, and extracting admin credentials.
- The exploit also highlights the use of incorrect access controls to disclose the database credentials.
