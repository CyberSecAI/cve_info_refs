- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect implementation of RFC 6125 wildcard matching.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The wildcard matching logic for certificates with wildcards was flawed. A certificate such as `b*.domain.com` would incorrectly match any hosts `*b*.domain.com` instead of just server names beginning with `b`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially use an incorrectly matched certificate to impersonate a server or bypass certificate verification, leading to a potential man-in-the-middle attack or other security breaches.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability could be exploited by presenting a specially crafted certificate with a wildcard to a client during a TLS handshake or any other process that validates certificate hostnames against provided domains.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to be able to either issue or obtain a certificate with a maliciously crafted wildcard and then be in a position to present this certificate for verification.
