Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9352:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is located in the `libhevc` library, specifically related to how it handles reorder parameters when decoding HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding) video streams. The patch addresses an issue where an invalid reorder parameter can cause a crash or denial-of-service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of reorder parameters during HEVC decoding
- Lack of proper validation of input parameters

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) - The primary impact is crashing the media process, leading to a denial of service. The provided text notes "DoS | High" for the vulnerability in older Android versions
- Potential for other unspecified impacts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves a maliciously crafted HEVC video stream containing invalid reorder parameters.
- This malformed media could be delivered to a vulnerable device through various means, such as downloaded media, a website, or MMS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create or modify HEVC video streams to include malformed reorder parameters.
- The attacker needs to have the video stream processed by a vulnerable device. This does not require a privileged position on the device.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided patch details indicate that the fix returns an error when an invalid reorder parameter is encountered, preventing the crash.
- There are two related commits associated with the CVE indicating a more thorough fix was applied.
