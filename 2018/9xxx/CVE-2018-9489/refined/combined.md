# Microsoft Authenticator for Android Allows Screen Capture

[September 5, 2018April 26, 2020](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2018/09/05/microsoft-authenticator-for-android-allows-screen-capture/) [nightwatchcyber](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/author/nightwatchcyber/)
[Advisories](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/category/advisories/)[Android](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/android/), [microsoft](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/microsoft/)

**Microsoft** offers an application for Android called “[Microsoft Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator)” which is used to setup two-factor authentication (2FA). This application operates in two modes – one allows to generate standard OTP codes like many other apps (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc). The second mode allows a user to register with Azure’s [Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks), and allows users to authenticate by tapping a prompt on their phone instead of entering an OTP code (similar to [Google Prompt](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6361026)).

However, it looks like that the application still allows screenshots to be taken. This is true for setting up the OTP with a manual seed, viewing generated OTP codes, and entering a username + password when setting up Azure MFA. The implication is that if a user’s device ends up running a rogue app, that app can capture the initial OTP seed (if entered manually), the initial username and password for MFA, as well as all generated OTP codes as they are shown by the app, and thus break two factor authentication.

To replicate, try the following:

1. Open the application.
2. Setup a new OTP code by adding “other account” + a random seed, and view codes. Alternative, try to sign-up for MFA with a personal account.
3. Press Power + Volume Down at any sensitive screen and observe a screenshot being taken.

The underlying reason is because the app is not using “FLAG\_SECURE” for such screens (more information on FLAG\_SECURE can be found [in our earlier blog post](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2016/04/13/research-securing-android-applications-from-screen-capture/)). By contrast, many Android apps with higher security requirements use it.

### **Vendor Response**

We filed a bug report with the vendor (Microsoft) and here is their response:

> *Our team assessed the issue, and this does not meet the bar for servicing. We have informed the product team about this issue. MSRC is closing the case.*
>
> *As for CVE, since there is no fix going for this, we will not be assigning any CVE for this issue.*

### UPDATE (04/26/2020):

The vendor has fixed the issue in v6.2002.2038, released on March 25th, 2020. Screen capture is disabled by default and requires an opt-in by the user via settings as per the screenshot below. Users are encouraged to update to the latest version.

# [Content Injection in Amazon Kindle’s FireOS [CVE-2019-7399]](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2019/02/07/content-injection-in-amazon-kindles-fireos-cve-2019-7399/)

[February 7, 2019February 7, 2019](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2019/02/07/content-injection-in-amazon-kindles-fireos-cve-2019-7399/) [nightwatchcyber](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/author/nightwatchcyber/)

## Summary

The **FireOS** operating system provided by **Amazon** for **Fire** tablet devices can be injected with malicious content by an MITM attacker. An attacker can also capture the serial number of the device. The root cause is lack of HTTPS for legal content (terms of use and privacy policy) within the settings section.

The issue was discovered in FireOS **v5.3.6.3** and fixed by the vendor in **v5.3.6.4** that was released in **November 2018.** Devices will automatically update to the latest version. **CVE-2019-7399** has been assigned by MITRE to track this issue.

## Vulnerability Details

FireOS is an operating system provided by Amazon for the Fire tablet devices.  It is a customized fork of Android. While monitoring network traffic on a test device, we observed that several calls from the settings section (terms of use and privacy policy) are done without HTTPS and can be injected with malicious content by an MITM attacker. It is also possible for the attacker to observe this traffic and capture the serial number (DSN) of the device.

Screenshots of the captured traffic:

## **Steps To Replicate (on Ubuntu 18.04)**

1. Install the application on the Android device but do not start it.

2. Install **dnsmasq** and **NGINX** on the Linux host:

```
sudo apt-get install dnsmasq nginx

```

3. Modify the **/etc/hosts** file to add the following entry to map the domain name to the Linux host:

```
192.168.1.x www.kindle.com
192.168.1.x kindle.com
```

4. Configure **/etc/dnsmasq.conf** file to listen on the IP and restart DNSMASQ

```
listen-address=192.168.1.x
sudo /etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart
```

5. Add a file with malicious content (you may need to use sudo):

```
cd /var/www/html
mkdir support
echo powned >support/privacy
echo powned >support/terms

```

6. Modify the settings on the Kindle device to static, set DNS to point to “192.168.1.x”. AT THIS POINT – the Kindle device will resolve DNS against the Linux computer and serve the large servers file

7. Tap “Settings”, “Legal and Compliance”, and tap either “Terms of Use” or “Privacy”. Observe injected content.

## Vendor Response and Mitigation

The issue was discovered in **FireOS v5.3.6.3** and fixed by the vendor in **v5.3.6.4** that was released in **November 2018.** Devices will automatically update to the latest version. MITRE assigned **CVE-2019-7399** to track this issue.

# Summary

System broadcasts by **Android OS** expose information about the user’s device to all applications running on the device. This includes **the WiFi network name, BSSID, local IP addresses, DNS server information and the MAC address**. Some of this information (MAC address) is no longer available via APIs on Android 6 and higher, and extra permissions are normally required to access the rest of this information. However, by listening to these broadcasts, any application on the device can capture this information thus bypassing any permission checks and existing mitigations.

Because MAC addresses do not change and are tied to hardware, **this can be used to uniquely identify and track any Android device** even when MAC address randomization is used. The network name and BSSID **can be used to geolocate users** via a lookup against a database of BSSID such as [WiGLE](https://wigle.net/) or [SkyHook](https://www.skyhookwireless.com/). Other networking information can be used by rogue apps to further explore and attack the local WiFi network.

**All versions of Android running on all devices are believed to be affected including forks** (such as Amazon’s FireOS for the Kindle). The vendor (**Google**) fixed these issues in **Android P / 9** but does not plan to fix older versions. Users are encouraged to upgrade to Android P / 9 or later. **CVE-2018-9489** has been assigned by the vendor to track this issue. Further research is also recommended to determine whether this is being exploited in the wild.

Amazon plans to address this issue as their transition devices to a new version of FireOS.

# Background

**Android** is an open source operating system developed by **Google** for mobile phones and tablets. It is estimated that over two billion devices exist worldwide running Android. Applications on Android are usually segregated by the OS from each other and the OS itself. However, interaction between processes and/or the OS is still possible via several mechanisms.

In particular, Android provides the use of “**Intents**” as one of the ways for inter-process communication. A broadcast using an “Intent” allows an application or the OS to send a message system-wide which can be listened to by other applications. While functionality exists to restrict who is allowed to read such messages, application developers often neglect to implement these restrictions properly or mask sensitive data. This leads to a common vulnerability within Android applications where a malicious application running on the same device can spy on and capture messages being broadcast by other applications.

Another security mechanism present in the Android is **permissions**. These are safeguards designed to protect the privacy of users. Applications must explicitly request access to certain information or features via a special “**uses-permission**” tag in the application manifest (“**AndroidManifest.xml**”). Depending on the type of permission (“normal”, “dangerous”, etc”) the OS may display the permission information to the user during installation, or may prompt again during run-time. Some permissions can only be used by system applications and cannot be used by regular developers.

Screenshots of application permissions in Google Play and at run-time:

# Vulnerability Details

**Android OS** broadcasts information about the WiFi connection and the WiFi network interface on a regular basis using two intents: WifiManager’s [NETWORK\_STATE\_CHANGED\_ACTION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/WifiManager#NETWORK_STATE_CHANGED_ACTION) and WifiP2pManager’s [WIFI\_P2P\_THIS\_DEVICE\_CHANGED\_ACTION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/p2p/WifiP2pManager#WIFI_P2P_THIS_DEVICE_CHANGED_ACTION). This information includes the **MAC address** of the device, the **BSSID** and **network name** of the WiFi access point, and various networking information such as the **local IP range**, **gateway IP** and **DNS server addresses**. This information is available to all applications running on the user’s device.

While applications can also access this information via the [WifiManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/WifiManager), this normally requires the “[ACCESS\_WIFI\_STATE](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACCESS_WIFI_STATE)” permission in the application manifest. Geolocation via WiFi normally requires the “[ACCESS\_FINE\_LOCATION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION)” or “[ACCESS\_COARSE\_LOCATION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION)” permissions. Also, on **Android versions 6.0 and later**, the real MAC address of the device is [no longer available](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/marshmallow/android-6.0-changes#behavior-hardware-id) via APIs and will always return the address “02:00:00:00:00:00”. However, an application listening for system broadcasts does not need these permissions thus allowing this information to be captured without the knowledge of the user and the real MAC address being captured even on Android 6 or higher.

Screenshot of an app trying to obtain MAC address in Android 7.0:

![pic7](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pic7.png?w=169&h=300)

We performed testing using a test farm of mobile device ranging across multiple types of hardware and Android versions. All devices and versions of Android tested confirmed this behavior, although some some devices do not display the real MAC address in the “[NETWORK\_STATE\_CHANGED\_ACTION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/WifiManager#NETWORK_STATE_CHANGED_ACTION)” intent but they still do within the “[WIFI\_P2P\_THIS\_DEVICE\_CHANGED\_ACTION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/p2p/WifiP2pManager#WIFI_P2P_THIS_DEVICE_CHANGED_ACTION)” intent. We also tested at least one fork (Amazon’s FireOS for the Kindle) and those devices displayed the same behavior.

**Because MAC addresses do not change and are tied to hardware, this can be used to uniquely identify and track any Android device even when MAC address randomization is used. The network name and/or BSSID can be used to geolocate users via a lookup against a database like [WiGLE](https://wigle.net/) or [SkyHook](https://www.skyhookwireless.com/). Other networking information can be used by rogue apps to further explore and attack the local WiFi network.**

# Steps to Replicate by Regular Users

For Android device users, you can replicate these issues as follows:

1. Install [the “Internal Broadcasts Monitor” application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=lt.andro.broadcastlogger) developed by Vilius Kraujutis from Google Play.
2. Open the application and tap “Start” to monitor broadcasts.
3. Observe system broadcasts, specifically “android.net.wifi.STATE\_CHANGE” and “android.net.wifi.p2p.THIS\_DEVICE\_CHANGED”.

Screenshot examples:

![pic1](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pic1.png?w=576&h=1024)  ![pic2](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pic2.png?w=576&h=1024)

# Steps to Replicate by Developers via Code

To replicate this in code, create a Broadcast receiver and register it to receive these actions (“android.net.wifi.WifiManager.NETWORK\_STATE\_CHANGED\_ACTION” and “android.net.wifi.WifiP2pManager.WIFI\_P2P\_THIS\_DEVICE\_CHANGED\_ACTION”). Sample code appears below:

```
public class MainActivity extends Activity {
@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle state) {
    IntentFilter filter = new IntentFilter();
    filter.addAction(
	android.net.wifi.WifiManager.NETWORK_STATE_CHANGED_ACTION);
    filter.addAction(
	android.net.wifi.WifiP2pManager.WIFI_P2P_THIS_DEVICE_CHANGED_ACTION);
    registerReceiver(receiver, filter);
}

BroadcastReceiver receiver = new BroadcastReceiver() {
@Override
public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
    Log.d(intent.toString());
    ….
}
};
```
# Vendor Response and Mitigation

The vendor (Google) classified this issue as Moderate, and provided a fix in **Android P / 9**. Because this would be a breaking API change, the vendor does not plan to fix prior versions of Android. Users are encouraged to upgrade to **Android P / 9** or later.

Amazon has responded regarding their Android fork (FireOS) as follows:

> *We are planning to address the issue as devices transition to the new version of Fire OS*

# Overview

Amazon supplies the Silk Browser for their line of Kindle tablets. The browser includes a selection of three search engines, of which Google was setup without SSL. Furthermore, the browser prevented automatic redirection to the SSL version of Google’s main site when visiting it directly.

# Details

Amazon provides the Silk browser, which is based on Google’s Chrome, for their line of Kindle Fire tablets. The Silk browser includes ability to select from three search engines (as shown in the screenshot below) – Google, Bing and Yahoo. Of these, when Google is selected, all searches  via the browser’s omnibox are done without HTTPS resulting in ability of malicious third parties to monitor user’s search engine traffic. Furthermore, going to “**[http://www.google.com](https://www.google.com)**” which normally would redirect to the SSL version, stayed in HTTP mode and prevented redirection. All other Google international domains (like google.ru, google.fr, etc) automatically redirected to the SSL versions.

The version we tested was **v49.3.1**, the vendor fixed the issue in **v51.2.1**. It is recommended that all users upgraded to the newest version of the Silk browser.

# Summary

System broadcasts by **Android OS** expose information about the user’s device to all applications running on the device. This includes **the WiFi network name, BSSID, local IP addresses, DNS server information and the MAC address**. Some of this information (MAC address) is no longer available via APIs on Android 6 and higher, and extra permissions are normally required to access the rest of this information. However, by listening to these broadcasts, any application on the device can capture this information thus bypassing any permission checks and existing mitigations.

Because MAC addresses do not change and are tied to hardware, **this can be used to uniquely identify and track any Android device** even when MAC address randomization is used. The network name and BSSID **can be used to geolocate users** via a lookup against a database of BSSID such as [WiGLE](https://wigle.net/) or [SkyHook](https://www.skyhookwireless.com/). Other networking information can be used by rogue apps to further explore and attack the local WiFi network.

**All versions of Android running on all devices are believed to be affected including forks** (such as Amazon’s FireOS for the Kindle). The vendor (**Google**) fixed these issues in **Android P / 9** but does not plan to fix older versions. Users are encouraged to upgrade to Android P / 9 or later. **CVE-2018-9489** has been assigned by the vendor to track this issue. Further research is also recommended to determine whether this is being exploited in the wild.

Amazon plans to address this issue as their transition devices to a new version of FireOS.

# Background

**Android** is an open source operating system developed by **Google** for mobile phones and tablets. It is estimated that over two billion devices exist worldwide running Android. Applications on Android are usually segregated by the OS from each other and the OS itself. However, interaction between processes and/or the OS is still possible via several mechanisms.

In particular, Android provides the use of “**Intents**” as one of the ways for inter-process communication. A broadcast using an “Intent” allows an application or the OS to send a message system-wide which can be listened to by other applications. While functionality exists to restrict who is allowed to read such messages, application developers often neglect to implement these restrictions properly or mask sensitive data. This leads to a common vulnerability within Android applications where a malicious application running on the same device can spy on and capture messages being broadcast by other applications.

Another security mechanism present in the Android is **permissions**. These are safeguards designed to protect the privacy of users. Applications must explicitly request access to certain information or features via a special “**uses-permission**” tag in the application manifest (“**AndroidManifest.xml**”). Depending on the type of permission (“normal”, “dangerous”, etc”) the OS may display the permission information to the user during installation, or may prompt again during run-time. Some permissions can only be used by system applications and cannot be used by regular developers.

Screenshots of application permissions in Google Play and at run-time:

# Vulnerability Details

**Android OS** broadcasts information about the WiFi connection and the WiFi network interface on a regular basis using two intents: WifiManager’s [NETWORK\_STATE\_CHANGED\_ACTION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/WifiManager#NETWORK_STATE_CHANGED_ACTION) and WifiP2pManager’s [WIFI\_P2P\_THIS\_DEVICE\_CHANGED\_ACTION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/p2p/WifiP2pManager#WIFI_P2P_THIS_DEVICE_CHANGED_ACTION). This information includes the **MAC address** of the device, the **BSSID** and **network name** of the WiFi access point, and various networking information such as the **local IP range**, **gateway IP** and **DNS server addresses**. This information is available to all applications running on the user’s device.

While applications can also access this information via the [WifiManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/WifiManager), this normally requires the “[ACCESS\_WIFI\_STATE](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACCESS_WIFI_STATE)” permission in the application manifest. Geolocation via WiFi normally requires the “[ACCESS\_FINE\_LOCATION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION)” or “[ACCESS\_COARSE\_LOCATION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION)” permissions. Also, on **Android versions 6.0 and later**, the real MAC address of the device is [no longer available](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/marshmallow/android-6.0-changes#behavior-hardware-id) via APIs and will always return the address “02:00:00:00:00:00”. However, an application listening for system broadcasts does not need these permissions thus allowing this information to be captured without the knowledge of the user and the real MAC address being captured even on Android 6 or higher.

Screenshot of an app trying to obtain MAC address in Android 7.0:

![pic7](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pic7.png?w=169&h=300)

We performed testing using a test farm of mobile device ranging across multiple types of hardware and Android versions. All devices and versions of Android tested confirmed this behavior, although some some devices do not display the real MAC address in the “[NETWORK\_STATE\_CHANGED\_ACTION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/WifiManager#NETWORK_STATE_CHANGED_ACTION)” intent but they still do within the “[WIFI\_P2P\_THIS\_DEVICE\_CHANGED\_ACTION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/p2p/WifiP2pManager#WIFI_P2P_THIS_DEVICE_CHANGED_ACTION)” intent. We also tested at least one fork (Amazon’s FireOS for the Kindle) and those devices displayed the same behavior.

**Because MAC addresses do not change and are tied to hardware, this can be used to uniquely identify and track any Android device even when MAC address randomization is used. The network name and/or BSSID can be used to geolocate users via a lookup against a database like [WiGLE](https://wigle.net/) or [SkyHook](https://www.skyhookwireless.com/). Other networking information can be used by rogue apps to further explore and attack the local WiFi network.**

# Steps to Replicate by Regular Users

For Android device users, you can replicate these issues as follows:

1. Install [the “Internal Broadcasts Monitor” application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=lt.andro.broadcastlogger) developed by Vilius Kraujutis from Google Play.
2. Open the application and tap “Start” to monitor broadcasts.
3. Observe system broadcasts, specifically “android.net.wifi.STATE\_CHANGE” and “android.net.wifi.p2p.THIS\_DEVICE\_CHANGED”.

Screenshot examples:

![pic1](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pic1.png?w=576&h=1024)  ![pic2](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pic2.png?w=576&h=1024)

# Steps to Replicate by Developers via Code

To replicate this in code, create a Broadcast receiver and register it to receive these actions (“android.net.wifi.WifiManager.NETWORK\_STATE\_CHANGED\_ACTION” and “android.net.wifi.WifiP2pManager.WIFI\_P2P\_THIS\_DEVICE\_CHANGED\_ACTION”). Sample code appears below:

```
public class MainActivity extends Activity {
@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle state) {
    IntentFilter filter = new IntentFilter();
    filter.addAction(
	android.net.wifi.WifiManager.NETWORK_STATE_CHANGED_ACTION);
    filter.addAction(
	android.net.wifi.WifiP2pManager.WIFI_P2P_THIS_DEVICE_CHANGED_ACTION);
    registerReceiver(receiver, filter);
}

BroadcastReceiver receiver = new BroadcastReceiver() {
@Override
public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
    Log.d(intent.toString());
    ….
}
};
```
# Vendor Response and Mitigation

The vendor (Google) classified this issue as Moderate, and provided a fix in **Android P / 9**. Because this would be a breaking API change, the vendor does not plan to fix prior versions of Android. Users are encouraged to upgrade to **Android P / 9** or later.

Amazon has responded regarding their Android fork (FireOS) as follows:

> *We are planning to address the issue as devices transition to the new version of Fire OS*

# Summary

System broadcasts by **Android OS** expose information about the user’s device to all applications running on the device. This includes **the WiFi network name, BSSID, local IP addresses, DNS server information and the MAC address**. Some of this information (MAC address) is no longer available via APIs on Android 6 and higher, and extra permissions are normally required to access the rest of this information. However, by listening to these broadcasts, any application on the device can capture this information thus bypassing any permission checks and existing mitigations.

Because MAC addresses do not change and are tied to hardware, **this can be used to uniquely identify and track any Android device** even when MAC address randomization is used. The network name and BSSID **can be used to geolocate users** via a lookup against a database of BSSID such as [WiGLE](https://wigle.net/) or [SkyHook](https://www.skyhookwireless.com/). Other networking information can be used by rogue apps to further explore and attack the local WiFi network.

**All versions of Android running on all devices are believed to be affected including forks** (such as Amazon’s FireOS for the Kindle). The vendor (**Google**) fixed these issues in **Android P / 9** but does not plan to fix older versions. Users are encouraged to upgrade to Android P / 9 or later. **CVE-2018-9489** has been assigned by the vendor to track this issue. Further research is also recommended to determine whether this is being exploited in the wild.

Amazon plans to address this issue as their transition devices to a new version of FireOS.

# Background

**Android** is an open source operating system developed by **Google** for mobile phones and tablets. It is estimated that over two billion devices exist worldwide running Android. Applications on Android are usually segregated by the OS from each other and the OS itself. However, interaction between processes and/or the OS is still possible via several mechanisms.

In particular, Android provides the use of “**Intents**” as one of the ways for inter-process communication. A broadcast using an “Intent” allows an application or the OS to send a message system-wide which can be listened to by other applications. While functionality exists to restrict who is allowed to read such messages, application developers often neglect to implement these restrictions properly or mask sensitive data. This leads to a common vulnerability within Android applications where a malicious application running on the same device can spy on and capture messages being broadcast by other applications.

Another security mechanism present in the Android is **permissions**. These are safeguards designed to protect the privacy of users. Applications must explicitly request access to certain information or features via a special “**uses-permission**” tag in the application manifest (“**AndroidManifest.xml**”). Depending on the type of permission (“normal”, “dangerous”, etc”) the OS may display the permission information to the user during installation, or may prompt again during run-time. Some permissions can only be used by system applications and cannot be used by regular developers.

Screenshots of application permissions in Google Play and at run-time:

# Vulnerability Details

**Android OS** broadcasts information about the WiFi connection and the WiFi network interface on a regular basis using two intents: WifiManager’s [NETWORK\_STATE\_CHANGED\_ACTION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/WifiManager#NETWORK_STATE_CHANGED_ACTION) and WifiP2pManager’s [WIFI\_P2P\_THIS\_DEVICE\_CHANGED\_ACTION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/p2p/WifiP2pManager#WIFI_P2P_THIS_DEVICE_CHANGED_ACTION). This information includes the **MAC address** of the device, the **BSSID** and **network name** of the WiFi access point, and various networking information such as the **local IP range**, **gateway IP** and **DNS server addresses**. This information is available to all applications running on the user’s device.

While applications can also access this information via the [WifiManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/WifiManager), this normally requires the “[ACCESS\_WIFI\_STATE](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACCESS_WIFI_STATE)” permission in the application manifest. Geolocation via WiFi normally requires the “[ACCESS\_FINE\_LOCATION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION)” or “[ACCESS\_COARSE\_LOCATION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION)” permissions. Also, on **Android versions 6.0 and later**, the real MAC address of the device is [no longer available](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/marshmallow/android-6.0-changes#behavior-hardware-id) via APIs and will always return the address “02:00:00:00:00:00”. However, an application listening for system broadcasts does not need these permissions thus allowing this information to be captured without the knowledge of the user and the real MAC address being captured even on Android 6 or higher.

Screenshot of an app trying to obtain MAC address in Android 7.0:

![pic7](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pic7.png?w=169&h=300)

We performed testing using a test farm of mobile device ranging across multiple types of hardware and Android versions. All devices and versions of Android tested confirmed this behavior, although some some devices do not display the real MAC address in the “[NETWORK\_STATE\_CHANGED\_ACTION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/WifiManager#NETWORK_STATE_CHANGED_ACTION)” intent but they still do within the “[WIFI\_P2P\_THIS\_DEVICE\_CHANGED\_ACTION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/p2p/WifiP2pManager#WIFI_P2P_THIS_DEVICE_CHANGED_ACTION)” intent. We also tested at least one fork (Amazon’s FireOS for the Kindle) and those devices displayed the same behavior.

**Because MAC addresses do not change and are tied to hardware, this can be used to uniquely identify and track any Android device even when MAC address randomization is used. The network name and/or BSSID can be used to geolocate users via a lookup against a database like [WiGLE](https://wigle.net/) or [SkyHook](https://www.skyhookwireless.com/). Other networking information can be used by rogue apps to further explore and attack the local WiFi network.**

# Steps to Replicate by Regular Users

For Android device users, you can replicate these issues as follows:

1. Install [the “Internal Broadcasts Monitor” application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=lt.andro.broadcastlogger) developed by Vilius Kraujutis from Google Play.
2. Open the application and tap “Start” to monitor broadcasts.
3. Observe system broadcasts, specifically “android.net.wifi.STATE\_CHANGE” and “android.net.wifi.p2p.THIS\_DEVICE\_CHANGED”.

Screenshot examples:

![pic1](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pic1.png?w=576&h=1024)  ![pic2](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pic2.png?w=576&h=1024)

# Steps to Replicate by Developers via Code

To replicate this in code, create a Broadcast receiver and register it to receive these actions (“android.net.wifi.WifiManager.NETWORK\_STATE\_CHANGED\_ACTION” and “android.net.wifi.WifiP2pManager.WIFI\_P2P\_THIS\_DEVICE\_CHANGED\_ACTION”). Sample code appears below:

```
public class MainActivity extends Activity {
@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle state) {
    IntentFilter filter = new IntentFilter();
    filter.addAction(
	android.net.wifi.WifiManager.NETWORK_STATE_CHANGED_ACTION);
    filter.addAction(
	android.net.wifi.WifiP2pManager.WIFI_P2P_THIS_DEVICE_CHANGED_ACTION);
    registerReceiver(receiver, filter);
}

BroadcastReceiver receiver = new BroadcastReceiver() {
@Override
public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
    Log.d(intent.toString());
    ….
}
};
```
# Vendor Response and Mitigation

The vendor (Google) classified this issue as Moderate, and provided a fix in **Android P / 9**. Because this would be a breaking API change, the vendor does not plan to fix prior versions of Android. Users are encouraged to upgrade to **Android P / 9** or later.

Amazon has responded regarding their Android fork (FireOS) as follows:

> *We are planning to address the issue as devices transition to the new version of Fire OS*

# Summary

System broadcasts by **Android OS** expose information about the user’s device to all applications running on the device. This includes **the WiFi network name, BSSID, local IP addresses, DNS server information and the MAC address**. Some of this information (MAC address) is no longer available via APIs on Android 6 and higher, and extra permissions are normally required to access the rest of this information. However, by listening to these broadcasts, any application on the device can capture this information thus bypassing any permission checks and existing mitigations.

Because MAC addresses do not change and are tied to hardware, **this can be used to uniquely identify and track any Android device** even when MAC address randomization is used. The network name and BSSID **can be used to geolocate users** via a lookup against a database of BSSID such as [WiGLE](https://wigle.net/) or [SkyHook](https://www.skyhookwireless.com/). Other networking information can be used by rogue apps to further explore and attack the local WiFi network.

**All versions of Android running on all devices are believed to be affected including forks** (such as Amazon’s FireOS for the Kindle). The vendor (**Google**) fixed these issues in **Android P / 9** but does not plan to fix older versions. Users are encouraged to upgrade to Android P / 9 or later. **CVE-2018-9489** has been assigned by the vendor to track this issue. Further research is also recommended to determine whether this is being exploited in the wild.

Amazon plans to address this issue as their transition devices to a new version of FireOS.

# Background

**Android** is an open source operating system developed by **Google** for mobile phones and tablets. It is estimated that over two billion devices exist worldwide running Android. Applications on Android are usually segregated by the OS from each other and the OS itself. However, interaction between processes and/or the OS is still possible via several mechanisms.

In particular, Android provides the use of “**Intents**” as one of the ways for inter-process communication. A broadcast using an “Intent” allows an application or the OS to send a message system-wide which can be listened to by other applications. While functionality exists to restrict who is allowed to read such messages, application developers often neglect to implement these restrictions properly or mask sensitive data. This leads to a common vulnerability within Android applications where a malicious application running on the same device can spy on and capture messages being broadcast by other applications.

Another security mechanism present in the Android is **permissions**. These are safeguards designed to protect the privacy of users. Applications must explicitly request access to certain information or features via a special “**uses-permission**” tag in the application manifest (“**AndroidManifest.xml**”). Depending on the type of permission (“normal”, “dangerous”, etc”) the OS may display the permission information to the user during installation, or may prompt again during run-time. Some permissions can only be used by system applications and cannot be used by regular developers.

Screenshots of application permissions in Google Play and at run-time:

# Vulnerability Details

**Android OS** broadcasts information about the WiFi connection and the WiFi network interface on a regular basis using two intents: WifiManager’s [NETWORK\_STATE\_CHANGED\_ACTION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/WifiManager#NETWORK_STATE_CHANGED_ACTION) and WifiP2pManager’s [WIFI\_P2P\_THIS\_DEVICE\_CHANGED\_ACTION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/p2p/WifiP2pManager#WIFI_P2P_THIS_DEVICE_CHANGED_ACTION). This information includes the **MAC address** of the device, the **BSSID** and **network name** of the WiFi access point, and various networking information such as the **local IP range**, **gateway IP** and **DNS server addresses**. This information is available to all applications running on the user’s device.

While applications can also access this information via the [WifiManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/WifiManager), this normally requires the “[ACCESS\_WIFI\_STATE](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACCESS_WIFI_STATE)” permission in the application manifest. Geolocation via WiFi normally requires the “[ACCESS\_FINE\_LOCATION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION)” or “[ACCESS\_COARSE\_LOCATION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION)” permissions. Also, on **Android versions 6.0 and later**, the real MAC address of the device is [no longer available](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/marshmallow/android-6.0-changes#behavior-hardware-id) via APIs and will always return the address “02:00:00:00:00:00”. However, an application listening for system broadcasts does not need these permissions thus allowing this information to be captured without the knowledge of the user and the real MAC address being captured even on Android 6 or higher.

Screenshot of an app trying to obtain MAC address in Android 7.0:

![pic7](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pic7.png?w=169&h=300)

We performed testing using a test farm of mobile device ranging across multiple types of hardware and Android versions. All devices and versions of Android tested confirmed this behavior, although some some devices do not display the real MAC address in the “[NETWORK\_STATE\_CHANGED\_ACTION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/WifiManager#NETWORK_STATE_CHANGED_ACTION)” intent but they still do within the “[WIFI\_P2P\_THIS\_DEVICE\_CHANGED\_ACTION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/p2p/WifiP2pManager#WIFI_P2P_THIS_DEVICE_CHANGED_ACTION)” intent. We also tested at least one fork (Amazon’s FireOS for the Kindle) and those devices displayed the same behavior.

**Because MAC addresses do not change and are tied to hardware, this can be used to uniquely identify and track any Android device even when MAC address randomization is used. The network name and/or BSSID can be used to geolocate users via a lookup against a database like [WiGLE](https://wigle.net/) or [SkyHook](https://www.skyhookwireless.com/). Other networking information can be used by rogue apps to further explore and attack the local WiFi network.**

# Steps to Replicate by Regular Users

For Android device users, you can replicate these issues as follows:

1. Install [the “Internal Broadcasts Monitor” application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=lt.andro.broadcastlogger) developed by Vilius Kraujutis from Google Play.
2. Open the application and tap “Start” to monitor broadcasts.
3. Observe system broadcasts, specifically “android.net.wifi.STATE\_CHANGE” and “android.net.wifi.p2p.THIS\_DEVICE\_CHANGED”.

Screenshot examples:

![pic1](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pic1.png?w=576&h=1024)  ![pic2](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pic2.png?w=576&h=1024)

# Steps to Replicate by Developers via Code

To replicate this in code, create a Broadcast receiver and register it to receive these actions (“android.net.wifi.WifiManager.NETWORK\_STATE\_CHANGED\_ACTION” and “android.net.wifi.WifiP2pManager.WIFI\_P2P\_THIS\_DEVICE\_CHANGED\_ACTION”). Sample code appears below:

```
public class MainActivity extends Activity {
@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle state) {
    IntentFilter filter = new IntentFilter();
    filter.addAction(
	android.net.wifi.WifiManager.NETWORK_STATE_CHANGED_ACTION);
    filter.addAction(
	android.net.wifi.WifiP2pManager.WIFI_P2P_THIS_DEVICE_CHANGED_ACTION);
    registerReceiver(receiver, filter);
}

BroadcastReceiver receiver = new BroadcastReceiver() {
@Override
public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
    Log.d(intent.toString());
    ….
}
};
```
# Vendor Response and Mitigation

The vendor (Google) classified this issue as Moderate, and provided a fix in **Android P / 9**. Because this would be a breaking API change, the vendor does not plan to fix prior versions of Android. Users are encouraged to upgrade to **Android P / 9** or later.

Amazon has responded regarding their Android fork (FireOS) as follows:

> *We are planning to address the issue as devices transition to the new version of Fire OS*

# Sensitive Data Exposure via Battery Information Broadcasts in Android OS [CVE-2018-15835]

*[NOTE: This bug is part of a series of three related Android bugs with the same root cause: [CVE-2018-9489](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2018/08/29/sensitive-data-exposure-via-wifi-broadcasts-in-android-os-cve-2018-9489/), [CVE-2018-9581](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2018/11/11/cve-2018-9581/) and [CVE-2018-15835](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2018/11/11/cve-2018-15835/).

# Summary

**System broadcasts by the Android operating system expose detailed information about the battery.** Prior research has demonstrated that the same charging information – when exposed via browser battery status API – can be used to uniquely identify and track users. As the result, the battery API was removed from most browsers.

On Android however, this information is made available with high precision. Furthermore, no special permission is required by any application to access this information. **As the result, this can be used to uniquely identify and track users across multiple apps.** This was verified via limited testing to be possible within a short period of time.

**Android versions 5.0 and later** are affected. The vendor (Google) does not classify this bug as a security issue and has not released any fix plans. **CVE-2018-15835** has been assigned by MITRE to track this issue. Further research is also recommended to see whether this is being exploited in the wild.

# Background

**Android** is an open source operating system developed by **Google** for mobile phones and tablets. It is estimated that over two billion devices exist worldwide running Android. Applications on Android are usually segregated by the OS from each other and the OS itself. However, interaction between processes and/or the OS is still possible via several mechanisms.

In particular, Android provides the use of “**Intents**” as one of the ways for inter-process communication. A broadcast using an “Intent” allows an application or the OS to send a message system-wide which can be listened to by other applications. While functionality exists to restrict who is allowed to read such messages, application developers often neglect to implement these restrictions properly or mask sensitive data. This leads to a common vulnerability within Android applications where a malicious application running on the same device can spy on and capture messages being broadcast by other applications.

Another security mechanism present in the Android is **permissions**. These are safeguards designed to protect the privacy of users. Applications must explicitly request access to certain information or features via a special “**uses-permission**” tag in the application manifest (“**AndroidManifest.xml**”). Depending on the type of permission (“normal”, “dangerous”, etc”) the OS may display the permission information to the user during installation, or may prompt again during run-time. Some permissions can only be used by system applications and cannot be used by regular developers.

Screenshots of application permissions in Google Play and at run-time:

![pic3](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pic3.png?w=169&h=300) ![pic4](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pic4.png?w=169&h=300) ![pic6](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pic6.png?w=169&h=300)

# Vulnerability Details

The Android OS broadcasts information about the battery system-wide on a regular basis including charging level, voltage and temperature. No special permission is needed to access this information. This is exposed via the “**android.intent.action.BATTERY\_CHANGED**” intent and is only available on **Android 5.0 or later**. The same information is also available via Android’s **BatteryManager** without a special permission.

A similar capability existed in browsers via W3C’s Battery Status API. However, extensive research by Łukasz Olejnik et al. showed that this API can be used to fingerprint devices, thus leading to tracking of users. Additional research revealed this being used in the wild by multiple websites, and the API was removed from most web browsers as the result.

In our limited testing we were able to distinguish devices located behind the same NAT device within a short period of time, thus leading to session re-spawning, but we were not yet able to replicate all the prior research regarding the HTML5 battery status API. This testing was based on the uniqueness of the current battery charging counter as being different across defines.

As the result, the same privacy issues that applied in the original Battery Status API should apply for Android applications resulting in applications being able to fingerprint and track users, and re-spawn session across multiple apps on the same device. Further research is needed to see if this is being actively exploited in the wild.

# Steps to Replicate by Regular Users

For Android device users, you can replicate these issues as follows:

1. Install [the “Internal Broadcasts Monitor” application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=lt.andro.broadcastlogger) developed by Vilius Kraujutis from Google Play.
2. Open the application and tap “Start” to monitor broadcasts.
3. Observe system broadcasts, specifically “android.net.wifi.STATE\_CHANGE” and “android.net.wifi.p2p.THIS\_DEVICE\_CHANGED”.

Screenshot example:

![text](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/text.png?w=175&h=300)

# Steps to Replicate by Developers via Code

To replicate this in code, create a Broadcast receiver and register it to receive the action “android.intent.action.BATTERY\_CHANGE”). Sample code appears below:

```
public class MainActivity extends Activity {
@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle state) {
    IntentFilter filter = new IntentFilter();
    filter.addAction(
	android.intent.action.BATTERY_CHANGE);
    registerReceiver(receiver, filter);
}

BroadcastReceiver receiver = new BroadcastReceiver() {
@Override
public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
    Log.d(intent.toString());
    ….
}
};
```
# Vendor Response and Mitigation

The vendor (Google) classified this issue as “NSBC” = “Not Security Bulletin Class” – meaning ““It was rated as not being a security vulnerability that would meet the severity bar for inclusion in an Android security bulletin.” **CVE-2018-15835** was assigned by the vendor for tracking. No fix is yet available.

# Fixes for CVE-2018-9581 and CVE-2018-9489 in Android 10

[August 28, 2019August 28, 2019](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2019/08/28/fixes-for-cve-2018-9581-and-cve-2018-9489-in-android-10/) [nightwatchcyber](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/author/nightwatchcyber/)
[Advisories](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/category/advisories/)[Android](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/android/)

Two privacy issues with broadcasts in Android OS are expected to be fixed in Android Q / 10 which will be released in early September of 2019. You can see the details in Google’s security bulletin [available here](https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/android-q). Some of these fixes were not available for earlier version of Android.

We originally discovered these in the Spring of 2018 and they were disclosed via a talk at BSides DE late last year. Details are available as follows:

# Summary

System broadcasts by **Android OS** expose information about the user’s device to all applications running on the device. This includes **the WiFi network name, BSSID, local IP addresses, DNS server information and the MAC address**. Some of this information (MAC address) is no longer available via APIs on Android 6 and higher, and extra permissions are normally required to access the rest of this information. However, by listening to these broadcasts, any application on the device can capture this information thus bypassing any permission checks and existing mitigations.

Because MAC addresses do not change and are tied to hardware, **this can be used to uniquely identify and track any Android device** even when MAC address randomization is used. The network name and BSSID **can be used to geolocate users** via a lookup against a database of BSSID such as [WiGLE](https://wigle.net/) or [SkyHook](https://www.skyhookwireless.com/). Other networking information can be used by rogue apps to further explore and attack the local WiFi network.

**All versions of Android running on all devices are believed to be affected including forks** (such as Amazon’s FireOS for the Kindle). The vendor (**Google**) fixed these issues in **Android P / 9** but does not plan to fix older versions. Users are encouraged to upgrade to Android P / 9 or later. **CVE-2018-9489** has been assigned by the vendor to track this issue. Further research is also recommended to determine whether this is being exploited in the wild.

Amazon plans to address this issue as their transition devices to a new version of FireOS.

# Background

**Android** is an open source operating system developed by **Google** for mobile phones and tablets. It is estimated that over two billion devices exist worldwide running Android. Applications on Android are usually segregated by the OS from each other and the OS itself. However, interaction between processes and/or the OS is still possible via several mechanisms.

In particular, Android provides the use of “**Intents**” as one of the ways for inter-process communication. A broadcast using an “Intent” allows an application or the OS to send a message system-wide which can be listened to by other applications. While functionality exists to restrict who is allowed to read such messages, application developers often neglect to implement these restrictions properly or mask sensitive data. This leads to a common vulnerability within Android applications where a malicious application running on the same device can spy on and capture messages being broadcast by other applications.

Another security mechanism present in the Android is **permissions**. These are safeguards designed to protect the privacy of users. Applications must explicitly request access to certain information or features via a special “**uses-permission**” tag in the application manifest (“**AndroidManifest.xml**”). Depending on the type of permission (“normal”, “dangerous”, etc”) the OS may display the permission information to the user during installation, or may prompt again during run-time. Some permissions can only be used by system applications and cannot be used by regular developers.

Screenshots of application permissions in Google Play and at run-time:

# Vulnerability Details

**Android OS** broadcasts information about the WiFi connection and the WiFi network interface on a regular basis using two intents: WifiManager’s [NETWORK\_STATE\_CHANGED\_ACTION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/WifiManager#NETWORK_STATE_CHANGED_ACTION) and WifiP2pManager’s [WIFI\_P2P\_THIS\_DEVICE\_CHANGED\_ACTION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/p2p/WifiP2pManager#WIFI_P2P_THIS_DEVICE_CHANGED_ACTION). This information includes the **MAC address** of the device, the **BSSID** and **network name** of the WiFi access point, and various networking information such as the **local IP range**, **gateway IP** and **DNS server addresses**. This information is available to all applications running on the user’s device.

While applications can also access this information via the [WifiManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/WifiManager), this normally requires the “[ACCESS\_WIFI\_STATE](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACCESS_WIFI_STATE)” permission in the application manifest. Geolocation via WiFi normally requires the “[ACCESS\_FINE\_LOCATION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION)” or “[ACCESS\_COARSE\_LOCATION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION)” permissions. Also, on **Android versions 6.0 and later**, the real MAC address of the device is [no longer available](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/marshmallow/android-6.0-changes#behavior-hardware-id) via APIs and will always return the address “02:00:00:00:00:00”. However, an application listening for system broadcasts does not need these permissions thus allowing this information to be captured without the knowledge of the user and the real MAC address being captured even on Android 6 or higher.

Screenshot of an app trying to obtain MAC address in Android 7.0:

![pic7](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pic7.png?w=169&h=300)

We performed testing using a test farm of mobile device ranging across multiple types of hardware and Android versions. All devices and versions of Android tested confirmed this behavior, although some some devices do not display the real MAC address in the “[NETWORK\_STATE\_CHANGED\_ACTION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/WifiManager#NETWORK_STATE_CHANGED_ACTION)” intent but they still do within the “[WIFI\_P2P\_THIS\_DEVICE\_CHANGED\_ACTION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/p2p/WifiP2pManager#WIFI_P2P_THIS_DEVICE_CHANGED_ACTION)” intent. We also tested at least one fork (Amazon’s FireOS for the Kindle) and those devices displayed the same behavior.

**Because MAC addresses do not change and are tied to hardware, this can be used to uniquely identify and track any Android device even when MAC address randomization is used. The network name and/or BSSID can be used to geolocate users via a lookup against a database like [WiGLE](https://wigle.net/) or [SkyHook](https://www.skyhookwireless.com/). Other networking information can be used by rogue apps to further explore and attack the local WiFi network.**

# Steps to Replicate by Regular Users

For Android device users, you can replicate these issues as follows:

1. Install [the “Internal Broadcasts Monitor” application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=lt.andro.broadcastlogger) developed by Vilius Kraujutis from Google Play.
2. Open the application and tap “Start” to monitor broadcasts.
3. Observe system broadcasts, specifically “android.net.wifi.STATE\_CHANGE” and “android.net.wifi.p2p.THIS\_DEVICE\_CHANGED”.

Screenshot examples:

![pic1](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pic1.png?w=576&h=1024)  ![pic2](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pic2.png?w=576&h=1024)

# Steps to Replicate by Developers via Code

To replicate this in code, create a Broadcast receiver and register it to receive these actions (“android.net.wifi.WifiManager.NETWORK\_STATE\_CHANGED\_ACTION” and “android.net.wifi.WifiP2pManager.WIFI\_P2P\_THIS\_DEVICE\_CHANGED\_ACTION”). Sample code appears below:

```
public class MainActivity extends Activity {
@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle state) {
    IntentFilter filter = new IntentFilter();
    filter.addAction(
	android.net.wifi.WifiManager.NETWORK_STATE_CHANGED_ACTION);
    filter.addAction(
	android.net.wifi.WifiP2pManager.WIFI_P2P_THIS_DEVICE_CHANGED_ACTION);

# Vendor Response and Mitigation

The vendor (Google) classified this issue as Moderate, and provided a fix in **Android P / 9**. Because this would be a breaking API change, the vendor does not plan to fix prior versions of Android. Users are encouraged to upgrade to **Android P / 9** or later.

Amazon has responded regarding their Android fork (FireOS) as follows:

> *We are planning to address the issue as devices transition to the new version of Fire OS*

# Summary

System broadcasts by **Android OS** expose information about the user’s device to all applications running on the device. This includes **the WiFi network name, BSSID, local IP addresses, DNS server information and the MAC address**. Some of this information (MAC address) is no longer available via APIs on Android 6 and higher, and extra permissions are normally required to access the rest of this information. However, by listening to these broadcasts, any application on the device can capture this information thus bypassing any permission checks and existing mitigations.

Because MAC addresses do not change and are tied to hardware, **this can be used to uniquely identify and track any Android device** even when MAC address randomization is used. The network name and BSSID **can be used to geolocate users** via a lookup against a database of BSSID such as [WiGLE](https://wigle.net/) or [SkyHook](https://www.skyhookwireless.com/). Other networking information can be used by rogue apps to further explore and attack the local WiFi network.

**All versions of Android running on all devices are believed to be affected including forks** (such as Amazon’s FireOS for the Kindle). The vendor (**Google**) fixed these issues in **Android P / 9** but does not plan to fix older versions. Users are encouraged to upgrade to Android P / 9 or later. **CVE-2018-9489** has been assigned by the vendor to track this issue. Further research is also recommended to determine whether this is being exploited in the wild.

Amazon plans to address this issue as their transition devices to a new version of FireOS.

# Background

**Android** is an open source operating system developed by **Google** for mobile phones and tablets. It is estimated that over two billion devices exist worldwide running Android. Applications on Android are usually segregated by the OS from each other and the OS itself. However, interaction between processes and/or the OS is still possible via several mechanisms.

In particular, Android provides the use of “**Intents**” as one of the ways for inter-process communication. A broadcast using an “Intent” allows an application or the OS to send a message system-wide which can be listened to by other applications. While functionality exists to restrict who is allowed to read such messages, application developers often neglect to implement these restrictions properly or mask sensitive data. This leads to a common vulnerability within Android applications where a malicious application running on the same device can spy on and capture messages being broadcast by other applications.

Another security mechanism present in the Android is **permissions**. These are safeguards designed to protect the privacy of users. Applications must explicitly request access to certain information or features via a special “**uses-permission**” tag in the application manifest (“**AndroidManifest.xml**”). Depending on the type of permission (“normal”, “dangerous”, etc”) the OS may display the permission information to the user during installation, or may prompt again during run-time. Some permissions can only be used by system applications and cannot be used by regular developers.

Screenshots of application permissions in Google Play and at run-time:

# Vulnerability Details

**Android OS** broadcasts information about the WiFi connection and the WiFi network interface on a regular basis using two intents: WifiManager’s [NETWORK\_STATE\_CHANGED\_ACTION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/WifiManager#NETWORK_STATE_CHANGED_ACTION) and WifiP2pManager’s [WIFI\_P2P\_THIS\_DEVICE\_CHANGED\_ACTION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/p2p/WifiP2pManager#WIFI_P2P_THIS_DEVICE_CHANGED_ACTION). This information includes the **MAC address** of the device, the **BSSID** and **network name** of the WiFi access point, and various networking information such as the **local IP range**, **gateway IP** and **DNS server addresses**. This information is available to all applications running on the user’s device.

While applications can also access this information via the [WifiManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/WifiManager), this normally requires the “[ACCESS\_WIFI\_STATE](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACCESS_WIFI_STATE)” permission in the application manifest. Geolocation via WiFi normally requires the “[ACCESS\_FINE\_LOCATION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION)” or “[ACCESS\_COARSE\_LOCATION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION)” permissions. Also, on **Android versions 6.0 and later**, the real MAC address of the device is [no longer available](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/marshmallow/android-6.0-changes#behavior-hardware-id) via APIs and will always return the address “02:00:00:00:00:00”. However, an application listening for system broadcasts does not need these permissions thus allowing this information to be captured without the knowledge of the user and the real MAC address being captured even on Android 6 or higher.

Screenshot of an app trying to obtain MAC address in Android 7.0:

![pic7](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pic7.png?w=169&h=300)

We performed testing using a test farm of mobile device ranging across multiple types of hardware and Android versions. All devices and versions of Android tested confirmed this behavior, although some some devices do not display the real MAC address in the “[NETWORK\_STATE\_CHANGED\_ACTION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/WifiManager#NETWORK_STATE_CHANGED_ACTION)” intent but they still do within the “[WIFI\_P2P\_THIS\_DEVICE\_CHANGED\_ACTION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/p2p/WifiP2pManager#WIFI_P2P_THIS_DEVICE_CHANGED_ACTION)” intent. We also tested at least one fork (Amazon’s FireOS for the Kindle) and those devices displayed the same behavior.

**Because MAC addresses do not change and are tied to hardware, this can be used to uniquely identify and track any Android device even when MAC address randomization is used. The network name and/or BSSID can be used to geolocate users via a lookup against a database like [WiGLE](https://wigle.net/) or [SkyHook](https://www.skyhookwireless.com/). Other networking information can be used by rogue apps to further explore and attack the local WiFi network.**

# Steps to Replicate by Regular Users

For Android device users, you can replicate these issues as follows:

1. Install [the “Internal Broadcasts Monitor” application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=lt.andro.broadcastlogger) developed by Vilius Kraujutis from Google Play.
2. Open the application and tap “Start” to monitor broadcasts.
3. Observe system broadcasts, specifically “android.net.wifi.STATE\_CHANGE” and “android.net.wifi.p2p.THIS\_DEVICE\_CHANGED”.

# Steps to Replicate by Developers via Code

To replicate this in code, create a Broadcast receiver and register it to receive these actions (“android.net.wifi.WifiManager.NETWORK\_STATE\_CHANGED\_ACTION” and “android.net.wifi.WifiP2pManager.WIFI\_P2P\_THIS\_DEVICE\_CHANGED\_ACTION”). Sample code appears below:

```
public class MainActivity extends Activity {
@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle state) {
    IntentFilter filter = new IntentFilter();
    filter.addAction(
	android.net.wifi.WifiManager.NETWORK_STATE_CHANGED_ACTION);
    filter.addAction(
	android.net.wifi.WifiP2pManager.WIFI_P2P_THIS_DEVICE_CHANGED_ACTION);
    registerReceiver(receiver, filter);
}

BroadcastReceiver receiver = new BroadcastReceiver() {
@Override
public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
    Log.d(intent.toString());
    ….
}
};
```
# Vendor Response and Mitigation

The vendor (Google) classified this issue as Moderate, and provided a fix in **Android P / 9**. Because this would be a breaking API change, the vendor does not plan to fix prior versions of Android. Users are encouraged to upgrade to **Android P / 9** or later.

Amazon has responded regarding their Android fork (FireOS) as follows:

> *We are planning to address the issue as devices transition to the new version of Fire OS*
