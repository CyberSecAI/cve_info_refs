  "CVE-2018-9489": {
    "Root cause": "Android OS broadcasts sensitive WiFi information via intents without proper access controls or masking.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "System broadcasts expose sensitive data.",
       "Insufficient permission checks allow access to broadcast data.",
      "MAC address randomization bypass."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Device tracking and geolocation of users, and potential network attacks via exposed network information.",
    "Attack vectors": "Malicious apps installed on the user's device.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Requires a malicious app to be installed on the user's device. No special permissions are needed by the malicious app to listen to the broadcasts"
