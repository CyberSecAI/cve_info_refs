Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9267:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause of CVE-2018-9267 is a memory leak within the LAPD dissector of Wireshark.
- This is part of a larger set of memory leak issues found in various dissectors within Wireshark.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Memory Leak:** The primary vulnerability is that the LAPD dissector, and other dissectors as well, improperly handle memory allocation, leading to memory leaks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The memory leaks can lead to Wireshark crashing, which can be triggered by crafted packets.
-   The provided information suggests that malformed packets can be used to trigger the vulnerability, potentially causing a crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Network Injection:** An attacker could inject a malformed packet onto the network to trigger the memory leak in Wireshark as it analyzes network traffic.
-   **Malicious Capture Files:** An attacker can also provide a malformed packet capture file to a user. When the user opens the file, Wireshark can crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs the ability to inject network traffic or provide a malicious capture file. This means the attacker must have a position to do one of these actions.
-   The attacker also needs to know the target is using a vulnerable version of Wireshark and to have some knowledge about the targeted dissector.
