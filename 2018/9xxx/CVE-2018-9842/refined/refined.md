Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-9842:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The CyberArk Password Vault, when responding to a "Logon" command sent by a client over its proprietary network protocol (typically TCP port 1858), discloses a portion of its memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The vault inadvertently sends approximately 50 bytes of its memory in response to a logon request. This exposes internal data to the client.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Leak:** Repeated exploitation can leak potentially sensitive information from the vault's memory.
- **Undermines Security:** This vulnerability undermines the core purpose of a password vault, which is to securely store credentials and control access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Communication:** The vulnerability is triggered through the proprietary network protocol used by the CyberArk Password Vault.
- **Replay Attack:** A captured "Logon" message can be replayed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the PrivateArk Password Vault.
- **Protocol Knowledge:** The attacker must be able to send a valid logon message over the proprietary protocol.

**Additional details:**
- The disclosed memory includes 49 bytes starting at offset 0xe0 of the response.
- The "Logon" message itself does not appear to require unique information, so a previously captured message can be reused.
- The vulnerability affects CyberArk Password Vault versions prior to 9.7 and 10.
- The vendor released fixed versions, 9.7 and 10.
