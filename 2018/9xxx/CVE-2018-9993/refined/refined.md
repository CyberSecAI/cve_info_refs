Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-9993

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when creating new content in the Yunucms content management system. Specifically, the title parameter of news content is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application does not properly sanitize user input when adding a new content, specifically the "content title" field. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the title field. This malicious code gets stored and is later executed in the user's browser when the affected content is viewed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to:
    - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user cookies and session tokens.
    - **Defacement:** Modifying the appearance of the web page.
    - **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
    - **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive information from the user's browser.
    - **Phishing:** Displaying fake login forms to steal user credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when a user with admin privileges adds a new content via `http://localhost/index.php/admin/content/addcontent/cid/38`.
- The attacker inserts the malicious JavaScript code within the "content title" field, and then saves the content.
- The XSS payload is triggered when a user visits the page displaying the content, in this case `http://localhost/index.php/index/show/index?id=38`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Admin access:** An attacker must have administrative access to the Yunucms instance to add new content.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable fields:** The attacker needs to know that the content title field is vulnerable to XSS.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided examples use the payload `<svg/onload=alert(0)>` which triggers an alert box when rendered by the browser, demonstrating the execution of arbitrary javascript.
- The vulnerable software is Yunucms version 1.0.7.
