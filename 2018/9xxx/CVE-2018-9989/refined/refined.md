Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9989:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by a missing bounds check before reading the length of the pre-shared key (PSK) identity hint within the `ssl_parse_server_psk_hint()` function of the Mbed TLS library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Arithmetic overflow:** The code reads a 2-byte length field from the message, and this length is later used to read the PSK hint itself. If the provided length is maliciously crafted (very large), adding it to the current pointer `(*p)` could cause an integer overflow, leading to a read out of the message buffer `end`.
*   **Missing bounds check:** Before reading the 2-byte length field, the code lacked a check to ensure that at least 2 bytes were available to read. Without this check, an attacker could trigger an out-of-bounds read when parsing a malformed PSK hint.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** An attacker could cause a denial of service by sending a specially crafted server key exchange message with an invalid PSK identity hint. The overflow or out-of-bounds read would lead to an error, causing the server to terminate the connection.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network-based attack:** A malicious TLS server could send a crafted "Server Key Exchange" message containing the manipulated PSK hint length to the client during the TLS handshake, triggering the vulnerability in the client's Mbed TLS library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be in a position to send a malformed "Server Key Exchange" message to a vulnerable client. This could be an attacker posing as a rogue server, a man-in-the-middle attacker, or an attacker controlling the server. The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the PSK hint length within the server's "Server Key Exchange" message.
*   The attacker would need to successfully negotiate a TLS connection with the vulnerable server/client.

**Additional details:**

*   The fix involved adding a bounds check to ensure that there are at least 2 bytes available before reading the length and using `> end - len` instead of `+ len > end`.
*   The vulnerability is located in the `ssl_cli.c` file of the Mbed TLS library, specifically in the `ssl_parse_server_psk_hint()` function.
*   This issue was fixed by commit `740b218386083dc708ce98ccc94a63a95cd5629e` which added the missing bounds check and commit `5224a7544c95552553e2e6be0b4a789956a6464e` to correct the overflow.

This analysis provides more detail than the CVE description by pinpointing the specific function and the nature of the missing check and overflow.
