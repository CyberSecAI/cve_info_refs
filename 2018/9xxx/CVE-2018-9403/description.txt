In the MTK_FLP_MSG_HAL_DIAG_REPORT_DATA_NTF handler of flp2hal_-
    interface.c, there is a possible stack buffer overflow due to a missing
    bounds check. This could lead to local escalation of privilege in a
    privileged process with System execution privileges needed. User interaction
    is not needed for exploitation.
