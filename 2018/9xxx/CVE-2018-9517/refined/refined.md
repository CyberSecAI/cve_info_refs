{
  "CVE-2018-9517": {
    "Description": "A race condition between pppol2tp_session_create() and l2tp_eth_create() in net/l2tp/l2tp_netlink.c was found in the Linux kernel. Calling l2tp_tunnel_find() may result in a new tunnel being created with tunnel id of a previously removed tunnel which wouldn't be protected by the reference counter.",
    "Root cause": "Race condition in the Linux kernel's L2TP implementation during tunnel creation.",
    "Weaknesses": "Use-after-free due to race condition",
    "Impact": "Possible arbitrary code execution or denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local attacker with the ability to trigger the L2TP tunnel creation race condition.",
    "Required capabilities": "Privileged local access to a system with the vulnerable L2TP implementation. In the context of containers, an attacker within a container could trigger the race condition.",
	"Additional Details": "The vulnerability occurs because `l2tp_tunnel_find()` might return a new tunnel created with the same ID as a recently removed one. This new tunnel would not have the reference counter protection of the previously active tunnel. The upstream fix modifies `session_create` to pass the tunnel pointer directly, avoiding the need for `l2tp_tunnel_find()`"
