**Verification:**
The provided commit message from `android.googlesource.com_7d10d2b9_20250126_130159.html` includes the bug ID 116791157, which matches the bug ID associated with CVE-2018-9594 in the Android Security Bulletin. Thus, the content is relevant to this CVE.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing integrity check in the AGF PDU (Application General Format Protocol Data Unit) within the NFC (Near Field Communication) module. This lack of validation can lead to an out-of-bounds read error.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The core weakness is the potential for an out-of-bounds read when processing AGF PDUs due to the missing integrity check.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information disclosure:** The out-of-bounds read could potentially leak sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially crafted AGF PDU:** A remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted AGF PDU to an affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Proximity:** The attacker would need to be within NFC range of the vulnerable device to send the malicious AGF PDU.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix implemented to address this issue is an improved AGF PDU integrity check which was intended to prevent out-of-bounds errors.
- The vulnerability was present in Android versions 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, 8.1, and 9.
