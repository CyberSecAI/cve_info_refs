{
  "CVE-2018-9282": {
    "Root cause": "The podcast subscription form in Subsonic application is vulnerable to stored XSS due to insufficient input sanitization.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input sanitization",
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript payloads into the podcast subscription form, which will then be executed when a user visits the page, potentially leading to session manipulation or privilege escalation by targeting an administrator.",
     "Attack vectors": [
        "The attacker can inject a malicious JavaScript payload into the 'add' parameter of the podcast subscription form via a POST request.",
         "The malicious script is stored on the server and is executed whenever a user accesses the vulnerable page."
      ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user, but no administrator access is required."
  }
