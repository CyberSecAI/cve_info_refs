```
{
  "CVE-2018-9516": {
    "Root cause": "The debug interface for the Linux kernel's HID subsystem did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations when copying data to user buffers in the `hid_debug_events_read()` function.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
       "Insufficient bounds checking"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker with access to debugfs could use this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly gain additional privileges by corrupting kernel memory.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access to the debugfs filesystem and the HID subsystem's debug interface.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires access to the debugfs filesystem, which is typically restricted to the root user."
  }
