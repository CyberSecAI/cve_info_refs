Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9838:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an integer overflow in the `caml_ba_deserialize` function within the `bigarray.c` module of the OCaml standard library. This function is responsible for deserializing (unmarshalling) objects, often used for network operations and inter-process communication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The `malloc` function is called with a size calculated by multiplying `elt_size` and `num_elts`. An integer overflow in this calculation can lead to a small value being passed to malloc, leading to a heap overflow when data is written to the undersized buffer.
*   **Heap Overflow:** The integer overflow in the `malloc` calculation leads to an undersized buffer allocation. When the deserialization process attempts to write data into this small buffer, a heap overflow occurs.
*   **Arbitrary Memory Write:** This heap overflow vulnerability allows an attacker to overwrite arbitrary memory locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By carefully crafting a malicious input that triggers the integer overflow, an attacker can overwrite memory to gain control of program execution. This can be achieved through techniques like overwriting return addresses or GOT entries.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can lead to program crashes due to memory corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Input:** The vulnerability is triggered during the deserialization of an external, potentially malicious, object. Thus it can be exploited remotely.
*   **Network Operations/Interprocess Communication:**  The bigarray module is used for network operations and interprocess communication so any application that uses this module and deserializes untrusted data is vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Supply Malicious Data:** An attacker needs the ability to provide a specially crafted input to the vulnerable application.
*   **Understanding of OCaml Internals:** A deeper understanding of OCaml internal memory management, particularly of BigArrays is needed in order to successfully craft the malicious input to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided writeup suggests that the exploit is applicable to various OCaml versions and can be triggered in both compiled and interpreted modes.
*   The exploit uses a one-gadget technique, specific to the glibc version used, for gaining code execution. This means that the specific exploit details may need to be adapted to different libc versions.
* The vulnerability was discovered by `maximilian.tschirschnitz@gmx.de` and the exploit developed with `philipp.hagenlocher@tum.de`.
