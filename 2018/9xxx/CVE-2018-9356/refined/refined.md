Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9356:

**CVE-2018-9356**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** A double-free vulnerability in the `pan_data_buf_ind_cb` function within the Bluetooth module (`system/bt`). The vulnerability occurs because the buffer is freed twice.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Double free vulnerability
*  **Impact of exploitation:**  Remote code execution (RCE) within the context of a privileged process.
*   **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can exploit this by sending a crafted Bluetooth packet that triggers the double-free in the `pan_data_buf_ind_cb` function.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted Bluetooth packets to a vulnerable device.

**Additional Notes**
* The provided commit message explicitly mentions "DO NOT MERGE Fix unexpected behavior in bta_dm_ssp_result" and "Check the number of UUIDs from remote device" which might be related to the vulnerability context, but not the direct root cause.
* The fix involves moving the `free()` call for the buffer inside `pan_data_buf_ind_cb()`, ensuring it is only freed once.
* The bug was found during manual testing of tethering.
* The patch was cherry-picked from a previous commit.
