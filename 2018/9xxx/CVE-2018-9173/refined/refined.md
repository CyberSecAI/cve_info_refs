Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the `movieName` parameter within the `uploadify.swf` file. This file is a flash component used for file uploads in GetSimple CMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core issue is a reflected XSS vulnerability. Attackers can inject arbitrary web script or HTML through the vulnerable `movieName` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can execute malicious JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious actions, including:
    - Stealing cookies and session tokens.
    - Redirecting users to phishing sites.
    - Defacing websites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript code within the `movieName` parameter of the `uploadify.swf` file. The user must be tricked into visiting this manipulated URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload.
- The attacker needs to persuade or trick the victim into clicking on the malicious URL.
- The attacker can be remote and does not require direct access to the server.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided exploit code examples showcase the XSS, with one example injecting a simple alert box, and another demonstrating how to steal cookies.
- The vulnerability affects version 3.3.13 of GetSimple CMS.
- The recommended solution is to update to the latest version, which addresses this vulnerability.
