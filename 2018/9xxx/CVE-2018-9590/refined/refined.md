Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9590:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient bounds checking within the `wpa_supplicant` component when handling WNM-Sleep Mode requests. Specifically, when `ieee802_11_rx_wnmsleep_req()` is called for a short frame that has no more payload after the Public Action field, the code reads the Dialog Token field unconditionally, which is one octet long. This can lead to reading one octet beyond the end of the received frame data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The code attempts to read data past the end of the received frame when handling WNM-Sleep Mode requests with insufficient payload.
- **Missing bounds check:** The code doesn't check if enough payload exists before reading the Dialog Token field in the described situation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Reading beyond the frame could potentially expose data from a stack/hash buffer or from an uninitialized part of the buffer.
- Although the function returns immediately after reading this value and doesn't use this value further, it still can lead to reading of potentially sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious actor can send a specially crafted WNM-Sleep Mode request with a short frame lacking the necessary payload, triggering the out-of-bounds read.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to send IEEE 802.11 frames to the vulnerable device, typically within Wi-Fi range.
- The attacker should have the capability to craft WNM-Sleep Mode requests.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was initially introduced with the addition of WNM-Sleep Mode implementation, but remained present through multiple changes.
- The vulnerable code path is only reachable when `CONFIG_IEEE80211V=y` and `CONFIG_WNM=y` build parameters are set.
- The code was fixed by adding an explicit check to ensure enough payload exists before attempting to read the Dialog Token field.
