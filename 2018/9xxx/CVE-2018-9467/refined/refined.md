Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9467:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper parsing of the hostname part of a URL within `java.net.URLStreamHandler`. Specifically, the code doesn't correctly treat certain characters ('/', '\', '#', and '?') as terminators during hostname parsing.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation: The code fails to correctly identify and handle special characters that should terminate the hostname part of a URL.
- Incorrect parsing logic: The parsing algorithm does not conform to the specification at [https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#host-state](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#host-state) which defines how hostnames should be parsed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
This vulnerability allows for an Elevation of Privilege (EoP). Although the specific consequences of this EoP are not detailed in this document, it could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate or influence the interpretation of URLs. This could lead to unintended connections or access to resources or other security-related issues.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious URLs: An attacker could craft a URL where the host part includes characters like '/', '\', '#', or '?' that would normally be interpreted as terminators.
- URL injection/manipulation: The vulnerability could potentially be exploited through injection or manipulation of URLs within an application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to supply a crafted URL to a vulnerable application using the flawed `java.net.URLStreamHandler` implementation.
- No special user privileges or system access are needed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The fix involves ensuring that the URL parsing logic adheres to the WHATWG URL specification, which explicitly defines the characters that must be treated as terminators during hostname parsing.
- The fix was tested by running `CtsLibcoreTestCases`.
- The vulnerability is present in Android versions 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, 8.1 and 9.
