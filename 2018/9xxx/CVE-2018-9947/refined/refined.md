{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length, heap-based buffer during the parsing of BMP images.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Heap-based buffer overflow"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code under the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user to visit a malicious webpage or open a malicious file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted BMP file to the targeted user. User interaction is required."
