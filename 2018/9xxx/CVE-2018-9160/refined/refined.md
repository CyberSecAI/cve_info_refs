Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9160:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The SickRage application was returning clear-text credentials within HTTP responses. Specifically, it was displaying sensitive information such as passwords for various services (GitHub, AniDB, Kodi, Plex, etc.) directly in the HTML source of configuration pages.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cleartext Storage of Credentials:** Passwords and API keys were being stored and displayed in plain text in the HTML source code.
- **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive user credentials were exposed within HTTP responses, leading to potential unauthorized access to external services if an attacker intercepts the response.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could intercept the HTTP response and gain access to the user's credentials for various services, leading to:
- **Unauthorized Access:** Gaining access to user accounts on third-party services such as GitHub, AniDB, Kodi, Plex etc.
- **Data Breach:** Compromising user data and potentially leaking sensitive information.
- **Account Takeover:** Complete control of user accounts for various connected services.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network Interception:** An attacker positioned on the same network as the victim could intercept HTTP responses to the SickRage web interface and extract the clear-text credentials.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** An attacker could perform a MitM attack to capture the HTTP traffic between the user's browser and the SickRage server.
- **Compromised Network:** If the network was compromised, an attacker could passively sniff network traffic and gain access to the credentials.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept the HTTP traffic between the user and the SickRage server. This can be done by being on the same local network, through MitM attacks, or a compromised network.
- No authentication is needed for the SickRage web interface. The vulnerability is exploitable if the user did not set a username and password for their SickRage installation, which is the default configuration.
- Basic understanding of network traffic and HTML source code is required to locate the exposed credentials within the HTTP responses.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability was present in versions of SickRage prior to v2018.03.09-1.
- The fix involved hiding the password fields in the HTML source.
- The provided exploit code demonstrates how to retrieve the git_username and git_password from the HTML source of the `/config/general` page
- The exploit requires knowledge of the target IP address and port number where the application is running.
