Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-9526:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from how the GnssLocationProvider and related framework code handles incoming SMS SUPL_INIT messages with the ES bit set to 1.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Restriction of Message Handling:** The code accepts incoming SMS SUPL_INIT messages with the ES bit set to 1, which is intended for emergency call scenarios, even when an emergency call is not active. This allows redirection of the ESLP endpoint outside of an emergency call.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially redirect the ESLP endpoint to a malicious server, potentially intercepting or manipulating location data. The description suggests this redirection should only occur during an emergency call. Bypassing this restriction leads to an information disclosure vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **SMS Messages:** The attack vector involves sending specially crafted SMS messages (SUPL_INIT messages with the ES bit set to 1) to the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **SMS Sending Capability:** The attacker needs the ability to send SMS messages to the target device.
- **Knowledge of SUPL Protocol:** The attacker would need to have knowledge of the SUPL protocol and how to construct the malicious SMS messages.
