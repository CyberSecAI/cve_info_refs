# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

# Mbed TLS

Mbed TLS

**Project implements cryptographic primitives, X.509 certificate manipulation and the SSL/TLS and DTLS protocols. The project provides reference implementation of [PSA Cryptography API Specification](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ihi0086/b) by supporting the cryptographic operations via. PSA Crypto APIs. The project also supports the [PSA Cryptoprocessor driver interface Specification](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/blob/development/docs/proposed/psa-driver-interface.md) which defines an interface for cryptoprocessor drivers. The small code footprint makes the project suitable for embedded systems. It has many users, including TF-A, TF-M and OP-TEE.**

Package        : polarssl
Version        : 1.3.9-2.1+deb8u4
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-0169 CVE-2018-0497 CVE-2018-0498 CVE-2018-9988
                 CVE-2018-9989
Debian Bug     :

Two vulnerabilities were discovered in polarssl, a lightweight crypto and
SSL/TLS library (nowadays continued under the name mbedtls) which could
result in plain text recovery via side-channel attacks.

Two other minor vulnerabilities were discovered in polarssl which could
result in arithmetic overflow errors.

CVE-2018-0497

    As a protection against the Lucky Thirteen attack, the TLS code for
    CBC decryption in encrypt-then-MAC mode performs extra MAC
    calculations to compensate for variations in message size due to
    padding. The amount of extra MAC calculation to perform was based on
    the assumption that the bulk of the time is spent in processing
    64-byte blocks, which is correct for most supported hashes but not for
    SHA-384. Correct the amount of extra work for SHA-384 (and SHA-512
    which is currently not used in TLS, and MD2 although no one should
    care about that).

    This is a regression fix for what CVE-2013-0169 had been fixed this.

CVE-2018-0498

    The basis for the Lucky 13 family of attacks is for an attacker to be
    able to distinguish between (long) valid TLS-CBC padding and invalid
    TLS-CBC padding. Since our code sets padlen = 0 for invalid padding,
    the length of the input to the HMAC function gives information about
    that.

    Information about this length (modulo the MD/SHA block size) can be
    deduced from how much MD/SHA padding (this is distinct from TLS-CBC
    padding) is used. If MD/SHA padding is read from a (static) buffer, a
    local attacker could get information about how much is used via a
    cache attack targeting that buffer.

    Let's get rid of this buffer. Now the only buffer used is the
    internal MD/SHA one, which is always read fully by the process()
    function.

CVE-2018-9988

    Prevent arithmetic overflow on bounds check and add bound check
    before signature length read in ssl_parse_server_key_exchange().

CVE-2018-9989

    Prevent arithmetic overflow on bounds check and add bound check
    before length read in ssl_parse_server_psk_hint()

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1.3.9-2.1+deb8u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your polarssl packages.

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in mbed TLS, a lightweight crypto
and SSL/TLS library, which could result in denial of service, information
disclosure or side-channel attacks.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
2.4.2-1+deb9u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your mbedtls packages.
