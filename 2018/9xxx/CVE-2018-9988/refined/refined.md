Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9988:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a missing bounds check before reading the signature length in the `ssl_parse_server_key_exchange()` function within the mbedtls library. This missing check could lead to an out-of-bounds read, potentially causing a crash or other unexpected behavior. Additionally, there was a potential for arithmetic overflow on the bounds check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Bounds Check:** The code did not verify if there were enough bytes remaining in the buffer to read the 2-byte signature length before attempting to read it.
*   **Potential Arithmetic Overflow**: A previous check, `if( end != p + sig_len )`, was vulnerable to an arithmetic overflow. This was changed to `if( p != end - sig_len )` to fix it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could potentially cause a denial of service by sending a crafted "server key exchange" message with an invalid signature length, triggering the out-of-bounds read or the arithmetic overflow, leading to a crash or other unexpected behavior in the mbedtls library.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** An attacker positioned as a MitM could intercept a legitimate TLS handshake and inject a malicious "server key exchange" message.
*   **Compromised Server:** An attacker who has compromised a server could send such a malicious message during the handshake.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Interception or Control:** An attacker needs to be able to intercept or control the network connection during a TLS handshake. This could be achieved through a MitM attack or by compromising a server.
*   **TLS Handshake Participation:** The attacker must be able to participate in or influence the TLS handshake process to send the malicious "server key exchange" message.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involved adding a bounds check before reading the signature length (`if( p > end - 2 )`) and changing the check vulnerable to arithmetic overflow.
*   The vulnerability exists in the `ssl_cli.c` file of the mbedtls library.
*   The vulnerability was present in `polarssl`, the predecessor to mbedtls and also fixed there.
