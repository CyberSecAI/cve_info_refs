Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9497:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the processing of MPEG2 video files where insufficient validation occurs for minimum width and height parameters within the header. Specifically, there's a missing check for `min_wd` and `min_ht`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Missing input validation for minimum width (`min_wd`) and minimum height (`min_ht`) values.
- Potential stack corruption in the `esbr` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process.
- Stack corruption if the vulnerable function is reached with carefully crafted values.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By providing a specially crafted MPEG2 file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing a malicious file, for example, through a media player application.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix includes adding a check for `min_wd` and `min_ht` and updating the `stride` if the header decode is completed successfully.
- A stack corruption fix was also included and tested, indicating potential out-of-bounds issues when processing the video data.
