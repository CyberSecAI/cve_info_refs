{
  "CVE-2018-9582": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Package Installer was reading session info whenever the starting intent had the extra EXTRA_SESSION_ID. This allowed an external app to potentially spoof the calling package by inserting a valid session id into its own REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGE intent.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Bypassing user interaction requirements",
      "Spoofing calling package"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A local malicious application could bypass user interaction requirements in order to gain access to additional permissions.",
    "Attack vectors": "A local malicious app could insert a valid session ID into its own REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGE intent",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A malicious application installed on the device."
  }
