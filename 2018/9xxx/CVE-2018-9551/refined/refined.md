Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2018-9551:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an issue within the audio element loop in the Enhanced Radio (ER) syntax, specifically within the `aac` component.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-   The specific weakness is related to the handling of the audio element loop within the ER syntax. The provided commit message indicates the patch unifies the abort criterion for this loop, implying that previous handling was faulty. This can lead to an exploitable condition.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-   The vulnerability is classified as a Critical Remote Code Execution (RCE). This means a remote attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a specially crafted file that triggers the vulnerability in the media framework.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide the crafted file to the vulnerable device which would then need to process it. This would likely be achieved through social engineering or other methods of delivering the file. The attacker does not need to be local to the device.

**Additional notes:**

- The provided commit message:  "Unify audio element loop abort criterion in ER syntax" and "Bug: 112891548" directly corresponds to the CVE and the fix provided in the AOSP.
- The fix is present in AOSP version 9
