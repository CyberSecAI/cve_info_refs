Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9552:

**Verification:**

The provided content includes a commit message from `android.googlesource.com` with the bug ID "113260892". This bug ID matches the reference for CVE-2018-9552 in the Android Security Bulletin, confirming that the content is related to the CVE.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is an integer overflow/out-of-bounds access in the HEVC decoder, related to the CTB (Coding Tree Block) position within a frame. The decoder does not properly handle tile positions greater than 255.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Integer overflow**: The HEVC decoder doesn't properly validate tile positions leading to out-of-bounds access.
- **Out-of-bounds read**:  The decoder is trying to access memory beyond the allowed bounds when the tile position is greater than 255.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- The vulnerability is classified as an Information Disclosure (ID), and has a Critical severity rating.
-  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to potentially read sensitive data from memory. The Android Security Bulletin indicates that a successful exploit could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of a privileged process, but the provided commit messages suggest the primary impact is related to information disclosure.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attack vector is a specially crafted HEVC file that triggers the out-of-bounds access in the decoder by including tile positions greater than 255.
-  A remote attacker could exploit this by providing a malicious HEVC file to the device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to deliver a malicious HEVC file to the targeted device.
-  No additional privileges or user interaction are explicitly required for exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix introduces error checks to prevent out-of-bounds memory access when tile positions exceed 255.
- The commit message mentions "Add limits check for the CTB position in a frame," indicating the fix includes bounds checking.
- The Android Security Bulletin describes this as an Information Disclosure vulnerability, with the potential for arbitrary code execution.
