Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9328:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the `results.php` script of the Redbus Clone Script, specifically within the `ter_from` and `tag` parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input which results in the execution of arbitrary Javascript code in the context of the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to:
    - Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the user's browser.
    - Session hijacking through stealing cookies or other session identifiers.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites or phishing pages.
    - Defacement of the web page.
    - Performing actions on the userâ€™s behalf.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is via a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `results.php` page. The malicious JavaScript payload is injected within the `ter_from` and `tag` URL parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP GET requests. No specific user level access or prior authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability, making it remotely exploitable. The attacker could deliver this crafted URL via social media, email, or other communication channels.

**Technical Details:**
The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) clearly demonstrates the vulnerability:

- The malicious JavaScript payload is injected into the `ter_from` and `tag` parameters: `ter_from=%27);%3Cscript%3Ealert(%221%22);%3C/script%3E` and `tag=%27);%3Cscript%3Ealert(%221%22);%3C/script%3E`
- The server responds with a page that includes the unsanitized payload in the HTML output, specifically within the `<a>` tag in the navigation section: `<a href="results.php?ter_from=');<script>alert("1");</script>&tag=');<script>alert("1");</script>&datepicker=23-03-2018&backward">`
- When the victim's browser renders this, the JavaScript code `alert("1");` is executed, confirming the XSS vulnerability.
