Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-9312:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The article mentions a "backdoor" in the infotainment unit. While the specific nature of this backdoor isn't detailed, it allows a USB connection to bypass the infotainment unit and access the vehicle's K-CAN bus.
*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper security measures, particularly in how the infotainment unit interacts with the K-CAN bus.
*   The article points to the reuse of Texas Instruments code for operating the Jacinto chip to send CAN messages as a contributing factor to a vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Backdoor in Infotainment Unit:** The presence of a backdoor in the infotainment system allows unauthorized access to the vehicle's internal network (K-CAN bus).
*   **CAN Bus Access:** The vulnerability allows attackers to inject messages into the CAN bus and the engine control unit (ECU), potentially interfering with vehicle operation.
*   **Insecure Diagnostic Function:** ECUs respond to diagnostic messages even at normal driving speeds, which opens up a way for exploitation, such as reseting the ECU.
*  **Memory Corruption vulnerability:** In the telematics control box (TCB), researchers found a memory corruption that allows attackers to bypass signature protection and achieve remote code execution in the firmware.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Vehicle Control Interference:** Attackers can potentially interfere with or take over the operation of the vehicle by injecting malicious messages into the CAN bus and ECU.
*   **Remote Code Execution:**  Attackers can achieve remote code execution in the telematics control unit.
*   **Arbitrary Diagnostic Messages:** Attackers can send arbitrary diagnostic messages to the ECUs.
*   **Abnormal ECU behavior:** Sending diagnostic messages during normal driving speed could lead to critical security issues and allow attackers to reset the ECUs.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical USB Access:**  A compromised USB device can be plugged into the infotainment system to exploit the backdoor.
*   **Bluetooth:** The infotainment unit is vulnerable to attacks via Bluetooth.
*   **Cellular Network:**  The car's hardware can be hijacked wirelessly via the cellular phone network.
*   **Simulated GSM Network:** Researchers could trigger BMW Remote Services with arbitrary messages using a simulated GSM network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Access:** Required for attacks via USB and ODB diagnostics ports.
*   **Proximity (Bluetooth):** Required for Bluetooth-based attacks.
*   **Remote Access:** Required for attacks via the cellular network.
*   **Technical Expertise:** Required for reverse-engineering firmware and crafting attack messages.
*   **Access to Diagnostic Tools:** For diagnostic message injection.

**Additional Notes**
*   The specific details of the "backdoor" are not provided. The article suggests it might be related to default credentials or hardcoded accounts, but it is not explicitly stated.
*   The article mentions that the telematics unit vulnerability affects BMW models produced since 2012, implying a wide range of vehicles could be affected.
*   Some vulnerabilities affect the internet-connected infotainment unit, some affect the telematics control system, and some affect the wireless communication hardware.

The article provides more details than the basic CVE description, including specific attack vectors, affected components, and potential impacts. However, it lacks the detailed technical specifics to allow full exploitation as these were withheld by the researchers.
