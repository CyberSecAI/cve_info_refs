Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2018-9990:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue related to how stream names are handled within the topic typeahead feature.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS). The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided stream names when displaying them in the topic typeahead, allowing malicious JavaScript to be injected and executed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a victim's browser session, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could create a stream with a specially crafted name containing malicious JavaScript. When a user interacts with the topic typeahead (presumably while composing a message or searching), the vulnerable code would execute the injected script within their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create a stream with a malicious name. This likely requires a valid user account on the Zulip server, with sufficient privileges to create streams.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was present since the initial public release of Zulip.
- The vulnerability was reported by w9w.
- This issue is fixed in Zulip Server 1.7.2
