{
  "CVE-2018-9346": {
    "description": "In AudioPortConfig, we only initialize the index for audio_gain_config, but not other fields. That may cause uninit leak at listAudioPorts and listAudioPatches.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from incomplete initialization of fields within the AudioPortConfig structure. Specifically, while the index for audio_gain_config is initialized, other fields are left uninitialized.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Uninitialized data leak"
    ],
    "impact": "The incomplete initialization can lead to an uninitialized memory leak when listAudioPorts and listAudioPatches are called.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability can be triggered through the audio framework when listing audio ports or patches."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to interact with the audio framework in a way that would trigger the listing of audio ports or patches, which could be achieved by a malicious application."
