Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9525:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from improper handling of non-system overlay windows when media projection permissions are requested. Specifically, the issue is related to hiding non-system overlay windows when a media projection permission is granted, likely due to incorrect visibility update of these windows.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Handling of Overlay Windows:** The core issue is that the system fails to properly manage the visibility of non-system overlay windows during media projection permission requests.
*  **Incorrect Visibility Logic:** It's implied that the logic for updating the visibility of these overlay windows isn't correct, leading to a scenario where they aren't properly hidden.
*   **Missing Permissions Enforcement:**  The vulnerability is related to the system's failure to enforce proper hiding of overlay windows when permissions related to media projection are granted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** A local malicious application could exploit this vulnerability to potentially gain an advantage, potentially due to the overlay not being hidden as expected when it should have been.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Although not explicitly stated, the improper handling of overlays could potentially lead to information disclosure, if sensitive information was displayed on an overlay that was not hidden.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Malicious Application:** A malicious application installed on the device is the primary attack vector.
*   **Media Projection Permission:** Exploitation involves leveraging the granting of media projection permissions.
*   **Non-system Overlay Windows:** The vulnerability is triggered when non-system overlay windows are present.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the Android device.
*   **Application Permissions:** The malicious app would need to request the media projection permission which triggers the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided commit log mentions:
    *   Setting `PRIVATE_FLAG_HIDE_NON_SYSTEM_OVERLAY_WINDOWS`
    *   Updating visibility of non-system overlay windows on `relayoutWindow()`
    *   Adding permissions to SystemUI to hide non-system overlays.
* The fix involves hiding non-system overlays using the specified flag and additional permissions.
* The vulnerability is categorized as an Elevation of Privilege (EoP).

In summary, CVE-2018-9525 is an elevation of privilege vulnerability caused by improper handling of non-system overlay windows during media projection permission requests. A local malicious application can exploit this to gain some sort of unauthorized access by not being hidden as it should have been.
