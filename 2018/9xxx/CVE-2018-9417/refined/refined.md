  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2018-9417",
      "root_cause": "The TLS ULP (Upper Layer Protocol) was overriding the socket's protocol (`sk->prot`) with a new TLS-specific protocol structure. This structure was incorrectly based on the IPv4-specific `tcp_prot` struct, even when attached to an IPv6 socket. This caused IPv6 callbacks to be replaced with their IPv4 equivalents.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect protocol structure used for IPv6 TLS connections",
        "Improperly overriding socket protocol"
      ],
      "impact": "A local malicious application could potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local application"
      ],
       "required_capabilities": [
        "Malicious application installed on the device"
      ],
      "additional_information": "This vulnerability resides in the kernel's TLS implementation. The fix involves creating specific TLS protocol structures for both IPv4 and IPv6 and using the correct one based on the socket's address family."
