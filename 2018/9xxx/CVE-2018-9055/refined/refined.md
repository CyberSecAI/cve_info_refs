Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9055:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `jpc_firstone` function in `jpc_math.c`. This function is intended to find the index of the first '1' bit in a non-negative integer.
- The assertion `assert(x >= 0)` within the function was designed to prevent negative input. However, a crafted input can lead to the function being called with a negative value, specifically -2147483648, causing the assertion to fail and the program to abort.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Assertion Failure:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation before calling `jpc_firstone` function, leading to the assertion failure.
- **Negative Input:** The function does not handle negative input correctly, which triggers the assertion.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate impact is a denial of service. When a crafted input triggers the assertion, the program aborts, preventing further execution.
- **Remote DoS:** The Gentoo security advisory indicates this is remotely exploitable.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a specially crafted JPC image that leads to the `jpc_firstone` function being called with a negative value during the decoding process. The provided poc link in the github content confirms this.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted JPC image to be processed by the vulnerable software. No specific privileges are mentioned.
- It is implied that the attacker can trigger the vulnerable code remotely.

**Additional details:**
- The provided code snippets clearly shows the root cause of the assertion failure.
- The Gentoo security advisory (GLSA 201908-03) lists CVE-2018-9055 as one of the vulnerabilities affecting `media-libs/jasper` versions 2.0.16 and earlier.
- The advisory also suggests users to unmerge the vulnerable package due to lack of upstream maintenance.
