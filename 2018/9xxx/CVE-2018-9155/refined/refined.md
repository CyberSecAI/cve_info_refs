Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-9155

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization within the Open-AudIT Professional 2.1.1 application. Specifically, user-supplied data is not being validated or encoded before being rendered in the web interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. This allows an attacker to inject malicious client-side scripts (JavaScript, HTML) into the application's web pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to:
  - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user cookies or session tokens, allowing the attacker to impersonate the victim.
    - **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive data visible to the user.
    - **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting the victim to malicious websites or serving malware.
    - **Defacement:** Modifying the appearance of the web page.
    - **Phishing:** Displaying fake login prompts to harvest credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack is carried out via the web interface of Open-AudIT Professional.
- **Input Fields:** The vulnerability is triggered by injecting malicious code into specific input fields, like "Name" fields when creating attributes.
- **Multiple Instances:** The exploit can be triggered in the following areas:
    - `Admin -> Logs -> View System Logs`
    - `Manage -> Attributes -> Create Attributes`
    - `Manage -> Users -> Create Users`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a valid user with the "Attributes Creation role" or have access to the vulnerable page..
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the Open-AudIT web interface.
- **Malicious Payload:** The attacker needs to craft a suitable XSS payload (e.g., `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`).
