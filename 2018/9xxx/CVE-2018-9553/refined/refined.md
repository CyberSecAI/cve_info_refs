Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2018-9553:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-9553

**Description:** This vulnerability is located in the libvpx library, specifically when processing WebM files.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a double free issue within the `Mkvparser`. It occurs when a `PrimaryChromacitity` object attempts to free memory already deallocated, specifically when parsing a malformed WebM file. This is due to the `PrimaryChromacitity::Parse` function not taking ownership of the allocated `PrimaryChromacitity` object, which leads to the object being freed when the `MasteringMetadata` destructor runs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Double Free:** The primary vulnerability is a double-free condition. This arises from the `PrimaryChromacitity` destructor being called, which causes a double free because `PrimaryChromacitity::Parse` doesn't own the allocated memory.
* **Improper resource handling**: The code does not properly handle the allocated memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** This vulnerability is classified as a High severity RCE issue. Successful exploitation can enable a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process.
* **Denial of Service:** Although not explicitly stated, double-free vulnerabilities can also lead to denial of service due to memory corruption

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Specially Crafted File:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted WebM file.
* **File processing**: The vulnerability is triggered while processing the malformed WebM file through the media framework.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send or cause the device to process a malicious WebM file.
*   **No Special Privileges:** No specific privileges are needed for the attacker to trigger the vulnerability by providing a crafted file.

**Additional Details from the provided sources:**
*   The provided commit message `c4c92b2c6ed72a78ea430c3cdce564ec11866a24` resolves the double free.
*   The fix involved cherry-picking the fix for the double free when `Chromacity` parse fails.
* The fix is described as "Avoid double free when Chromaticity parse fails".
* The commit message refers to bug `116615297`

**Affected AOSP Versions:**
*   7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, 8.1, and 9
