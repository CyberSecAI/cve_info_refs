Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9545:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The provided information indicates a fix for an issue related to HID (Human Interface Device) in the `register_app` function within the Bluetooth component. The commit message "HID Device: Fix OOB in register_app" suggests there is an Out-of-Bounds (OOB) access issue during the registration process of a HID device application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-Bounds Access:** The vulnerability is a direct result of the software attempting to access memory outside of the allocated buffer when registering an HID application. This can lead to undefined behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** As categorized as an ID (Information Disclosure) vulnerability, exploitation could potentially allow an attacker to read sensitive data from memory.
- The severity is marked as "High" which indicates a significant risk.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious application or process on the device attempts to register a crafted HID device, triggering the out-of-bounds access within the Bluetooth system.
- **Proximity:** The attacker likely needs to be in Bluetooth range of the vulnerable device to initiate the malicious HID registration process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Application:** The attacker must be able to run code on the vulnerable device, or be able to inject malicious data into a process that makes use of HID profiles.
- **Bluetooth Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided commit message indicates the issue is related to "OOB" access. The commit fixes the issue directly, without additional context.
- The CVE is listed with other related Bluetooth vulnerabilities, CVE-2018-9540, CVE-2018-9541, CVE-2018-9542, CVE-2018-9543 and CVE-2018-9544, implying similar attack vectors and affected components.
- The fix for CVE-2018-9545 is bundled within the 2018-11-01 security patch level.

In summary, CVE-2018-9545 is a High severity information disclosure vulnerability caused by an out-of-bounds access in the Bluetooth HID device registration process, exploitable by a local attacker within Bluetooth range.
