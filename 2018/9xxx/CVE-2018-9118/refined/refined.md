Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-9118:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a directory traversal flaw in the `download.php` file of the WP Background Takeover WordPress plugin. The plugin doesn't properly sanitize the `filename` parameter, allowing an attacker to specify paths outside of the intended directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a directory traversal issue. By manipulating the `filename` parameter in the `download.php` file, an attacker can access files and directories on the server that are not intended to be publicly accessible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read sensitive files on the server. For example, the provided exploit specifically targets `wp-config.php`, which contains database credentials and other sensitive configuration information.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `download.php` file. The `filename` parameter in the query string is used to specify the file to be accessed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the server hosting the vulnerable WordPress instance.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of how to make HTTP requests and manipulate query string parameters.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.

**Technical Details**
The provided exploit example uses the following URL:
`http://target[.]com/wp-content/plugins/wpsite-background-takeover/exports/download.php?filename=../../../../wp-config.php`

This URL uses `../` sequences in the `filename` parameter to traverse up the directory tree, eventually reaching the `wp-config.php` file.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability exists in versions of the plugin prior to 4.1.4.
- The exploit is relatively simple to execute.
- The vendor for the plugin is 99robots.com.
