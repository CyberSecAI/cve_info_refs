##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## About WP Background Takeover

The [**WP Background Takeover**](https://draftpress.com/products/wp-background-takeover-advertisements/ "WP Background Takeover Plugin") plugin for WordPress makes it easy to enable wallpaper advertisements on your site.

We make it *simple* and *easy* for you to take control of advertising space on your site while still offering many opportunities for customization.

Background takeover ads are used by advertisers to claim more real estate on a website, as well as embraced by site owners as a way to get higher click-through rates for ads to generate more revenue. While most people have programmed themselves to ignore the standard ads on a site (usually in sidebar), it’s impossible to miss wallpaper takeover advertisements (also referred to as*background skins* or *wallpaper skins*).

These type of ads not only garner more attention from your visitors, but also have higher click-through rates which translates into better results.

Run wallpaper advertisements / homepage skins on your site just like the big fashion, gaming, tech, and gossip websites. Be sure to check out our **[demo of background takeover](http://demo.99robots.com/background-takeover "Background Takeover Demo")** at our demo site!

The [**WP Background Takeover**](https://draftpress.com/products/wp-background-takeover-advertisements/) plugin allows you to manage multiple background images that can be used for many various purposes (you can get very creative with this plugin!). We have included all of the necessary features to make sure that your website can become a marketing and ad revenue-generating machine. From scheduling, to style options, to assigning ads to custom post-types, you can manage multiple background takeover spots at once.

Rather than offering a standard banner ad spot, wallpaper ads will allow you to give advertisers maximum visibility.

## Video

## Features

#### Ad Scheduling / Automatic Expiration

You can schedule your ads as well as rate their priority from Low to High (in case multiple ad spots are competing for the background takeover at the same time). To schedule ads, simply provide the start and end dates.

#### Display Ads on Any Post, Category, Page, or Site-wide

Want custom advertisements based on a specific post or category? What about custom ads only for a specific tag or post type? Don’t fret because this plugin lets you select **exactly** where to display which background takeover advertisement. It also takes into account competing ads through a priority setting.

#### Link to One or Two URLs

This is the only background takeover plugin that allows you to link the left and right rails to distinct URLs. That’s right – click the left side and visitor is sent to URL-1, and click the right side and visitor is sent to URL-2. We’ve thought of everything to make your wallpaper ads super powerful!

#### Style Options

You can set the background color displayed behind your advertisement, decide whether to have the image scroll with the page or remain fixed, and select background repeat options.

#### BONUS: PSD Template to Create Your Own Background Takeover Ad

You’ll be itching to create your own takeover ads once you see the power of this advertising plugin, so we created a simple [PSD Template](https://draftpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/background-takeover-template-v02-compressed.psd.zip) to make it easier. It’s **FREE**.****

## Do you have a full-width site?

Full-width sites may require some amount of customization to fully be compatible with the Background takeover plugin.  We are happy to provide some quick suggestions around how the site can be customized which include quick **minor** CSS changes, however, theme changes and customization are unfortunately not part of the support plan and may require custom development or the help of a developer.

Example: The Nike Store

![](https://draftpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/nike-fullwidth.png)

## Rotate Ads

[![background-takeover-rotate-ads](https://draftpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/background-takeover-rotate-ads-1024x154.png)](https://draftpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/background-takeover-rotate-ads.png)

Now with version 4.1.0 you are able to randomly rotate Ads that are set to display on the same page.  Simply go to the All Ads Page and scroll down to the bottom to find the Advanced Settings Panel.  Expand this panel and you will see the Rotate Ads setting.

## Create a New Ad

To create an ad, simply click the blue**Add New** button at the top of the **Ad Dashboard**or on the side menu of your WordPress dashboard.

[![background-takeover-ad-dashboard](https://draftpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/background-takeover-ad-dashboard-1024x537.png)](https://draftpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/background-takeover-ad-dashboard.png)

When the user creates or edits an ad, they can choose from the **Ad Setup**or **Display Settings**tabs.

In the **Required**section, essential properties of the ad can be set. These include **Ad Name** (just for the user’s reference  on the Ad Dashboard), the option to select an **Ad Group** (to add new Ad Groups, reference **Groups** on the side menu of your WordPress dashboard).

[![background-takeover-create-ad](https://draftpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/background-takeover-create-ad-1024x600.png)](https://draftpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/background-takeover-create-ad.png)

This is also where the image for the ad can be uploaded, with the option to link the image to one URL or two URLs (one for each side of the ad).

In **Ad Setup**, the user will also be able to customize the ad’s **Style Options.**For example, a user may want the background image to repeat itself. To select a background repeat preference, select from the various options that **Background Repeat**has to offer.

To select whether the background image should scroll with the page or remain fixed, select a **Background Attachment** preference. The user also has the option to select the color of the background behind the image, and to stretch out the image if possible.

## Create a New Ad Group

To create new **Ad Groups**, go to to Background Takeover on the sidebar of your Admin Dashboard and go to **Groups.** You’ll want to make sure that you keep different groups if you work with advertisers that are providing multiple ad skins, and if you’re using background takeover for other marketing purposes, you’ll definitely want to keep organized.

Once Groups has been selected, you can can add a new group and come up with a name/description.

As I highlighted above, you’ll want to use groups to organize all of to carefully document all of the different ways you are applying Background Takeover to your site.

For example, if you were using a few different backgrounds to promote your social media presence, I would include a group called “My Social Media” and if you are working with an advertiser that is providing several different backgrounds that are on a rotating schedule, I would include a group such as “Ford”

## All Ads Statistics

Background Takeover does have a stats tracking feature that allows you to see what Ads are converting and what Ads are not.  You can view all of your Ads at once and compare them against each other or you can view just a single Ad’s stats.

[![background-takeover-stats-chart](https://draftpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/background-takeover-stats-chart-1024x753.png)](https://draftpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/background-takeover-stats-chart.png)

[![background-takeover-stats-table](https://draftpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/background-takeover-stats-table-1024x392.png)](https://draftpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/background-takeover-stats-table.png)

## Single Ad Statistics

[![background-takeover-stats-single-chart](https://draftpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/background-takeover-stats-single-chart-1024x741.png)](https://draftpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/background-takeover-stats-single-chart.png) [![background-takeover-stats-single-table](https://draftpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/background-takeover-stats-single-table-1024x554.png)](https://draftpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/background-takeover-stats-single-table.png)

## Display Settings

You can control the start and end dates of the Ads as well as what pages they will display on your site.

[![background-takeover-display-settings](https://draftpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/background-takeover-display-settings-1024x632.png)](https://draftpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/background-takeover-display-settings.png)

Under **Schedule****Settings**, users can schedule their ads and assign a **Start date** and **End date.** If you have many different backgrounds that are on rotation, this will allow you  to make sure that everything is displaying exactly on schedule.

The **Location Setting****s** for this plugin are robust – choose whether the ad will only should show on the front page of the website, on an archive page (tags or categories), exclusively to posts or pages, or to a specific post ID.  To get an easy way to show your post IDs download our free plugin [Show IDs](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsite-show-ids/). This is great if you are trying to use this plugin for a multi-purpose strategy since you may want to display something that is very specific to one page.
