Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9237:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the "Site Description" and "Site Title" fields within the iScripts EasyCreate platform. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application fails to properly sanitize user input before storing and displaying it, leading to persistent XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: By injecting malicious JavaScript code into the "Site Description" or "Site Title" fields, an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of a victim's browser.
- Session Hijacking: An attacker could potentially steal session cookies, allowing them to impersonate a user.
- Defacement: An attacker could modify the content of the website seen by other users.
- Phishing: An attacker could redirect users to a malicious site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the "user section" of the iScripts EasyCreate application
- Specifically, by accessing the dashboard, selecting "Created from saved items", and using the edit option.
-  The attacker injects malicious scripts within the vulnerable "Site Description" or "Site Title" fields during the "edit site" action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a valid user account within the iScripts EasyCreate system.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the "user section" dashboard.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit code provided uses `<script>alert('2')</script>` to demonstrate the XSS vulnerability within the "Site Description" field.
- Additionally, `</title>"><script>alert('1')</script>` demonstrates the XSS vulnerability within the "Site Title" field.
- The vulnerability exists within iScripts EasyCreate version 3.2.1.
