It's a issue that is similar to runc [CVE-2016-3697](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q3j5-32m5-58c2 "CVE-2016-3697").

Before this pr,

```
[root@localhost ~]# docker run --rm -ti ... 797fd343ef02 bash
[root@167b67fea278 /]# echo "10:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash">/etc/passwd
[root@167b67fea278 /]# cat /etc/passwd
10:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash

another console,
[root@localhost ~]# docker exec -ti -u 10 hello  bash
bash: /etc/profile.d/colorgrep.sh: Interrupted system call
[10@167b67fea278 /]# id
uid=0(10) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

```

After this pr,

```
[root@localhost ~]# docker run --rm -ti ... 797fd343ef02 bash
[root@167b67fea278 /]# echo "10:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash">/etc/passwd
[root@167b67fea278 /]# cat /etc/passwd
10:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash

another console,
[root@localhost ~]# docker exec -ti -u 10 hello  bash
bash: /etc/profile.d/colorgrep.sh: Interrupted system call
[10@167b67fea278 /]# id

| Hello, Thanks for the fixing.  Could you fix hyper\_getpwnam() hyper\_getgrnam() instead? (change it to: if the id is numeric, don't compare the name)  Other info is needed from /etc/passwd even the id is numeric. |

just

`if ((INVALID_UGID == uid && !strcmp(pwd->pw_name, name)) || pwd->pw_uid == uid) {`

is enough.

INVALID\_UGID should be changed to a better name.

The test case is above this pr, take hyper\_getpwnam(1000) for example

```
/etc/passwd
1000:x:1001:0:*:/*:/bin/bash
                   |
                   V
hyper_getpwnam(1000)  = struct passwd {pw_name: 1000, uid: 1001}

```

```
/etc/passwd
1000:x:1001:0:*:/*:/bin/bash
hello:x:1000:0:*:/*:/bin/bash
                   |
                   V
hyper_getpwnam(1000)  = struct passwd {pw_name: hello, uid: 1000}

```

```
/etc/passwd
have no 1000 as name or uid
                   |
                   V
hyper_getpwnam(1000)  = NULL

```

And what do you think we can use to replace INVALID\_UGID ?

please covert the logic to

if ((INVALID\_UGID == uid && !strcmp(pwd->pw\_name, name)) || pwd->pw\_uid == uid) {

so that "10" is always uid instead name.
