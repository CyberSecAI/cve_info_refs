{
  "cve_id": "CVE-2018-9860",
  "vulnerability": "Memory overread in TLS CBC decryption",
  "affected_component": "TLS CBC decryption",
  "root_cause": "An off-by-one error in TLS CBC decryption",
  "weaknesses": [
    "Off-by-one error",
    "Incorrect length calculation during TLS CBC decryption"
  ],
  "impact": "For a particular malformed ciphertext, the receiver would miscompute a length field and HMAC exactly 64K bytes of data following the record buffer as if it was part of the message. The MAC comparison will subsequently fail and the connection will be closed. This can be used for denial of service.",
  "attack_vectors": [
     "Malicious crafted ciphertext",
     "TLS connection"
  ],
  "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send malformed ciphertexts to the target via a TLS connection.",
  "more_info": "The vulnerability was found by OSS-Fuzz."
