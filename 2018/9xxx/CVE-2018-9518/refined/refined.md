Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9518:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a buffer overflow within the NFC Logical Link Control Protocol (llcp) implementation in the Linux kernel. Specifically, the issue lies in how the Service Discovery Protocol (SDP) URI is handled. The `tlv_len` field, which stores the length of the SDP URI, is a `u8` (8-bit unsigned integer). This means the maximum length is 255 bytes. However, the code didn't properly restrict the size of the SDP URI during allocation and copying which can lead to out of bounds write.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The core weakness is a buffer overflow. The code allocates memory based on the provided length and the tlv length can be greater than the allocated buffer. When copying the SDP URI into the allocated buffer, it doesn't perform sufficient length checks. This leads to a potential out-of-bounds write.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a system crash by triggering the buffer overflow, leading to a denial of service.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potentially):** The vulnerability has the potential for arbitrary code execution, meaning an attacker might be able to run malicious code on the system. This is possible due to the memory corruption from the buffer overflow, which could be manipulated to execute code

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Proximity:** The vulnerability exists in the NFC (Near Field Communication) subsystem. This implies the attacker needs to be within the range of NFC to trigger the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local or Near Field Access:** The attacker needs to be either local or be within NFC range of the target device to send maliciously crafted NFC packets, triggering the overflow in the llcp implementation.
- **Knowledge of NFC Protocol:** The attacker needs some understanding of the NFC protocol and specifically how to craft SDP request with a oversized URI.
- **Ability to Send Malicious NFC data:** The attacker needs to be able to send specifically crafted NFC packets to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The patch for this issue involves enforcing the `u8` length limit both in the Netlink policy and in the code that handles the allocation and copying of the SDP URI.
- The commit on lkml.org (https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/2/14/909) shows the fix, which includes a check to ensure that the SDP URI length is less than U8_MAX - 4 before allocation.
- The patch also adds a check in `nfc_llcp_build_sdreq_tlv` to ensure the length is within the acceptable range, before allocating memory.
