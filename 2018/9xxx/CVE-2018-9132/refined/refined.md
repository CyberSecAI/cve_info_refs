      "root_cause": "When `getInt` is passed a `PUSH_REGISTER` parameter, it retrieves the content of this register. If the register is empty (NULL), calling getInt with a NULL pointer results in a null pointer dereference.",
      "weaknesses": [

      "details": "The `getInt` function in `util/decompile.c` is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference. When `getInt` receives a `PUSH_REGISTER` parameter and the register is empty (NULL), it attempts to dereference a null pointer. This can be triggered via a crafted SWF file, leading to a crash."
