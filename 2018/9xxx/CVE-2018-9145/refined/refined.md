Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9145:

**Summary:**

The provided information indicates that CVE-2018-9145 is related to a reachable assertion abort within the `Exiv2::DataBuf::DataBuf` function in the `include/exiv2/types.hpp` file.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is a reachable assertion within the `Exiv2::DataBuf::DataBuf` constructor, which is triggered due to a specific input that leads to an invalid size value for the buffer allocation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

-   **Assertion Failure:** The vulnerability manifests as an assertion failure, which leads to program termination. While not a typical memory corruption vulnerability, it is triggered due to an invalid size value.
-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The program aborting due to the assertion can lead to a denial of service as it crashes the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service:** A specially crafted input can cause the `Exiv2` application to crash due to the assertion, leading to a denial of service. This prevents the application from processing images correctly.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Malicious Image File:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted image file that, when processed by `Exiv2`, triggers the assertion.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Ability to Provide Malicious Input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious image file to the `Exiv2` application. This could be done through various means, such as:
    -   Having a user open the file.
    -   Uploading the file to a system.
    -   Passing it to a service that uses Exiv2.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided github content contains multiple proof-of-concept files which lead to crashes when processed by exiv2.
- The `4-DataBuf-abort-1` test case directly relates to the CVE, showing the specific crash caused by the assertion in `Exiv2::DataBuf::DataBuf`.
- The gentoo security advisory (GLSA 201811-14) lists CVE-2018-9145 as one of the vulnerabilities fixed in `media-gfx/exiv2-0.26_p20180811-r3`, which further confirms the impact of the vulnerability.
- The Red Hat Bugzilla entry (1564281) confirms the assertion abort in `Exiv2::DataBuf::DataBuf`.

In summary, CVE-2018-9145 describes a denial of service vulnerability in `Exiv2` triggered by a specific input that leads to an assertion abort during memory allocation within the `DataBuf` constructor. An attacker can exploit this by providing a specially crafted file that triggers the assertion and crashes the application.
