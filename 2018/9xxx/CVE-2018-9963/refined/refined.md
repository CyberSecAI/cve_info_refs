    "cve_id": "CVE-2018-9963",
    "summary": "The vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of JPEG2000 images. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the current process.",

      {
        "type": "Root cause of vulnerability",
        "detail": "The root cause lies in the improper handling of user-supplied data during the parsing of JPEG2000 images, leading to an out-of-bounds read."
