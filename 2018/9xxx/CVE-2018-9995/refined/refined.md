  "CVE-2018-9995": {
    "cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of authentication checks on specific URLs of the DVR's web interface.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure Direct Object Reference",
      "Authentication Bypass",
       "Credentials Leak"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can retrieve plaintext user credentials (usernames and passwords) for the DVR, leading to unauthorized access to the device's video feeds, settings, and potentially the network it is connected to.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability is accessed by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to a specific URL of the DVR's web interface"
      ,
      "The attack vector is through HTTP, typically on ports 80 or 81."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable DVR to exploit the vulnerability. No authentication is required.",
     "additional_details": [
        "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a request to the URL path `/device.rsp?opt=user&cmd=list` with a cookie header `uid=admin`.",
         "The vulnerable DVRs respond with a JSON object containing user credentials.",
         "The vulnerability affects multiple brands of DVRs, likely due to the use of the same underlying firmware.",
         "The vulnerability is easily exploitable and can be scripted.  The default user agent of the exploit code contains a misspelling of Morzilla and Pinux to identify it."
