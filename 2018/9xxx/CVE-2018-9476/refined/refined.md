DO NOT MERGE AVRC: Copy browse.p_browse_data in btif_av_event_deep_copy

p_msg_src->browse.p_browse_data is not copied, but used after the
original pointer is freed.

Bug: 109699112
Test: manual
Change-Id: I1d014eb9a8911da6913173a9b11218bf1c89e16e
(cherry picked from commit 1d9a58768e6573899c7e80c2b3f52e22f2d8f58b)
```

Based on this commit message, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the Bluetooth stack. Specifically, the `p_msg_src->browse.p_browse_data` pointer is used after the memory it points to has been freed. This occurs during the `btif_av_event_deep_copy` function, where the data is not properly copied before the original pointer is released.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Use-after-free:** The primary vulnerability is a use-after-free. This occurs when a program attempts to access memory that has already been freed, leading to unpredictable behavior and potential security risks.
    *   **Missing Deep Copy:** The vulnerability arises because a deep copy of the `browse.p_browse_data` is not performed. A shallow copy or no copy is performed instead, causing both the source and destination to point to the same memory region. When the original data is freed, the copied pointer becomes a dangling pointer.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Exploitation of a use-after-free vulnerability can lead to various impacts including:
    *   **Memory corruption:** Accessing freed memory can corrupt other parts of memory, leading to crashes or other unexpected behavior.
    *   **Arbitrary code execution:** In some scenarios, an attacker can potentially overwrite the freed memory region with malicious data and then trigger the use-after-free to execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Denial of service:** A crash due to memory corruption can result in a denial-of-service condition.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector involves manipulating the Bluetooth stack such that the vulnerable `btif_av_event_deep_copy` function is called and the `p_msg_src->browse.p_browse_data` pointer is involved in an operation that causes the free before use scenario. This likely involves interaction with Bluetooth profiles related to browsing of media or similar data via the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) or Audio/Video Remote Control Profile (AVRCP).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker would need to be within Bluetooth range and able to interact with the vulnerable device over Bluetooth.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to trigger the code path involving `btif_av_event_deep_copy` to exploit the vulnerability. This might require specific knowledge of the Bluetooth protocol being used.

This commit message provides more details than a typical CVE description, outlining the specific location of the bug and how to reproduce it using Bluetooth interaction.
