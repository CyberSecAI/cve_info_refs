{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies within the bootloader, allowing a local attacker to bypass user interaction requirements.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Elevation of privilege (EoP) due to insufficient checks or validation in the bootloader code.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker can bypass user interaction requirements, gaining access to additional permissions. This could allow the attacker to perform actions on the device without the user's consent or knowledge.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local attacker with the ability to execute code on the device.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be in a position to execute code on the device and needs to be local."
