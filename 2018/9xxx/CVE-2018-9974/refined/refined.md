    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within ConvertToPDF_x86.dll. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it into a heap-based buffer.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
