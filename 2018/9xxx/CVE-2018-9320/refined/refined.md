Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-9320:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a "backdoor" in the infotainment unit of BMW vehicles. The article doesn't specify the exact nature of the backdoor, but notes that common backdoors are admin accounts with no password, default passwords, or hardcoded credentials. This backdoor allows an attacker to bypass the infotainment system and gain access to the vehicle's K-CAN bus.
- Additionally, the vulnerability is related to a lack of secure diagnostic function in the Engine Control Units (ECUs), which respond to diagnostic messages even when the car is moving at normal speed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Backdoor in Infotainment System:**  The presence of a backdoor allows unauthorized access to the vehicle's internal network.
- **Insecure Diagnostic Function:** ECUs respond to diagnostic messages even during normal driving, making it easier for attackers to manipulate the car's systems.
- **Memory Corruption Vulnerability:** A memory corruption vulnerability in the telematics control unit (TCB) firmware allows attackers to bypass signature protection and achieve remote code execution.
- **Vulnerable Code Reuse:** The article mentions that BMW reused Texas Instruments code "to operate the special memory of Jacinto chip to send the CAN messages," which may have introduced the vulnerability.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The diagnostic messages are processed by the ECUs without proper validation or protection, allowing attackers to send arbitrary commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **CAN Bus Injection:**  Attackers can inject messages into the vehicle's CAN bus, potentially interfering with the operation of the car.
- **Engine Control Unit Manipulation:** Attackers can send arbitrary diagnostic messages to the ECUs, potentially gaining control or causing malfunctions.
- **Remote Code Execution:** Attackers can remotely execute code on the telematics control unit.
- **Vehicle Hijacking:** Attackers could potentially hijack the car's hardware via the cellular phone network, injecting controlled diagnosis messages to the CAN buses.
- **Bypass Signature Protection:** Attackers can bypass signature protection mechanisms in the telematics control unit (TCB) firmware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Physical USB Access:**  Attackers can exploit the backdoor in the infotainment unit using a USB connection.
- **Bluetooth:** Attacks can be carried out remotely via Bluetooth.
- **Cellular Phone Network:** Attackers can remotely exploit the car's hardware via the cellular phone network.
- **Indirect Physical Access:** Some vulnerabilities require "indirect" physical access to the machine, which is not fully defined.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Physical Access:** Some attacks require physical access to the vehicle via USB or the OBD diagnostics port.
- **Proximity:**  Bluetooth attacks require the attacker to be in proximity to the vehicle.
- **Remote Access:** Exploitation via cellular network requires remote access to the vehicle's telematics system.
- **Technical Expertise:** Attackers need some level of technical knowledge to understand the vehicle's architecture and exploit the vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**
- The article mentions a total of 14 bugs found, with 7 assigned CVEs, including CVE-2018-9320.
- The article also explains that some vulnerabilities affect the infotainment unit (HU_NBT), the telematics control system (TCB), and wireless communication modules (BDC).
- The vulnerabilities were confirmed in BMW i3, X1, 525Li, and 730Li models, but the TCB bugs affect "BMW models which equipped with this module produced from year 2012."
- BMW is distributing patches, some over-the-air and some through the dealer network.

This article provides more detail than the basic CVE description, particularly in explaining the various attack vectors and affected systems within the vehicle. It also highlights the specific components (infotainment, telematics, CAN bus, ECUs) involved in these vulnerabilities.
