  "CVE-2018-9134": {
    "related_content": true,
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the file renaming functionality within the Dedecms V5.7 backend. Due to a lack of input sanitization, specifically with the `$newfilename` parameter, an attacker can rename an uploaded file to have a `.php` extension, which leads to arbitrary code execution.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Lack of input sanitization on `$fmdo`, `$oldfilename`, and `$newfilename` variables.",
        "Unrestricted file renaming capability that allows changing file extensions.",
		"Use of pseudo global variables which allow for arbitrary variable declaration."
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary code execution by uploading a file and renaming it to a PHP file. This allows an attacker to execute commands on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker needs to have access to the Dedecms backend interface. First, a file is uploaded to the server using a suitable upload point (e.g., the file upload feature in the frontend user center). Then, by crafting a specific HTTP request to `dede/file_manage_control.php` with the `fmdo` parameter set to rename, `oldfilename` parameter set to the path of the previously uploaded file, and `newfilename` to the desired path and filename with a `.php` extension, the attacker can rename the file to a malicious php file.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires a valid login to the Dedecms backend and the ability to upload files."
    },
     "additional_details": "The article provides a detailed proof-of-concept (PoC) that demonstrates the vulnerability, showing how to upload a file, and then craft a request to rename the file to a PHP file. It also mentions that the vulnerability can be combined with a stored XSS vulnerability for easier exploitation. The suggested fix involves filtering the `newfilename` parameter to prevent renaming files to have PHP extensions.  This content provides more detail than a typical CVE description."
