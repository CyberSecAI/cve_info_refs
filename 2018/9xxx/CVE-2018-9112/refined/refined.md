Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9112:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the reliance on cookies without proper validation and integrity checks in the web management page of the Foxconn FEMTO AP-FC4064-T device. The system uses cookie values to determine user privileges, rather than verifying user authentication with the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reliance on Cookies without Validation:** The web management page trusts the information stored in cookies without validating their authenticity or integrity. This makes it possible for an attacker to manipulate these cookies.
*   **Lack of Proper Access Control:** The system does not adequately enforce access controls on its web interface. Cookie-based authentication means that the application trusts user-controlled cookies to determine the user’s level of privilege.
*   **Weak Default Password:** A low-privileged account ("admin/admin") exists with a weak default password. This makes it easy for attackers to gain initial access to the web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can escalate their privileges from a low-privileged "admin" account to a high-privileged "foxconn" account by simply modifying the "Mode" value in the cookie (e.g., "Mode=low" to "Mode=ENG"). This bypasses the intended access controls.
*   **Full Control of the Device:** Gaining high-level access allows the attacker to modify any settings.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Cookie Manipulation:** The primary attack vector involves intercepting and modifying the cookies sent to and from the web management interface.
*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, as the web management page is accessible over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Foxconn FEMTO AP-FC4064-T device's web management interface.
*   **Basic Knowledge of Web Technologies:** The attacker needs to be able to understand how cookies work and how to modify them.
*   **Initial Access:** The attacker needs to know or gain access to a low-privileged account’s credentials (the default "admin/admin" account makes it simple).
*   **Ability to Intercept and Modify HTTP Requests:** Interception of the traffic is needed to change the cookie value.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable product is specifically the Foxconn FEMTO AP-FC4064-T device with firmware version AP\_GT\_B38\_5.8.3lb15-W47 LTE Build 15.
*   The vulnerability is classified under CWE-565: Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking.
*   The "admin" account has read-only access, while the "foxconn" account has full control.
*   The attacker does not need to brute-force the high-privilege "foxconn" account password if they use cookie manipulation.
*  The vulnerability was discovered by CFL Lab.
*   A patch was released within a week of reporting the vulnerability.
