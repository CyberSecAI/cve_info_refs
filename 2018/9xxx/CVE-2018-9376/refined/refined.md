{
  "CVE-2018-9376": {
    "Root cause": "A vulnerability related to reporting fake package names.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The vulnerability allows for the reporting of fake package names."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could potentially exploit this to mislead users or other apps by reporting a false package name.",
    "Attack vectors": "The specific attack vector is not detailed, but it involves manipulating the system to report a fake package name.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker would likely need to have some level of access to the system or be able to influence the reporting mechanism."
  },
    "CVE-2018-9426": {
    "Root cause": "The number of iterations used to confirm that a number is prime was based off the key length instead of the length of the factors p and q.",
    "Weaknesses": [
       "Incorrect calculation of iterations for prime number confirmation leading to lower than expected confidence in the primality of the key factors."
    ],
    "Impact": "Lower-than-expected confidence in the primality of key factors, which could potentially weaken the security of keys generated using affected code.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability affects apps using RSAPairGenerator directly instead of java.security.KeyPairGenerator. An attacker might try to exploit this by targeting vulnerable apps that directly utilize the flawed prime generation logic.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to target apps using a specific vulnerable code path, rather than system wide."
    }
