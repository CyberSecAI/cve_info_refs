Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-9839:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control checks in MantisBT's bug cloning functionality. Specifically, when a user attempts to clone a bug, the application fails to properly verify if the user has the necessary permissions to view the original bug's details before proceeding with the clone operation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The application directly uses the `m_id` parameter from the user's request to identify the bug to be cloned, without verifying if the user has the necessary permissions to view the referenced bug. This allows an attacker to manipulate the `m_id` parameter to access data related to private bugs, which they normally should not have access to.
*   **Missing Access Control Check:**  The core issue is that there is no access level check before accessing the bug data in the `bug_report_page.php` and `bug_report.php` files. This allows users with `REPORTER` access or above to access private bug details.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker with "Reporter" access or higher can view the summary, description, steps to reproduce, and additional information of any private issue by manipulating the `m_id` parameter during the cloning process.
*   **Public Exposure of Private Data:** By selecting the "Copy issue notes" and "Copy attachments" options during the clone operation, an attacker can also make the notes and attachments of private issues public (excluding private notes). This can lead to sensitive data being exposed to unauthorized users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `m_id` parameter in a POST request to `bug_report_page.php` during a bug clone attempt.
*   **Direct Access to `bug_report.php`:** The vulnerability also exists in `bug_report.php` where, using a forged request, an attacker can copy the private bug's notes and attachments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **MantisBT Account:** The attacker needs a valid MantisBT account with "Reporter" access or above.
*   **Knowledge of Private Issue IDs:** The attacker must know the `m_id` of the private issue they want to access.
*   **Network Access:**  The attacker needs network access to send the manipulated HTTP requests to the MantisBT application.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Mustafa Hasan (strukt) and reported to the MantisBT team.
*   The fix involves adding an access level check using `access_ensure_bug_level( config_get( 'view_bug_threshold' ), $f_master_bug_id )` before accessing bug data in `bug_report_page.php` and `bug_report.php` files.
*   The fix was implemented in commit `1fbcd9bca2f2c77cb61624d36ddee4b3802c38ea`.
*   The vulnerability affects MantisBT versions through 1.3.14 and 2.0.0.
