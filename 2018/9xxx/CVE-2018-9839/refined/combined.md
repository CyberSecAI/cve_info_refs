## Description

An issue was discovered in MantisBT through 1.3.14, and 2.0.0. Using a crafted request on bug\_report\_page.php (modifying the 'm\_id' parameter), any user with REPORTER access or above is able to view any private issue's details (summary, description, steps to reproduce, additional information) when cloning it. By checking the 'Copy issue notes' and 'Copy attachments' checkboxes and completing the clone operation, this data also becomes public (except private notes).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

| Summary | 0024221: CVE-2018-9839: Private issues accessible to unauthorized users using the "Clone" functionality | | | | |
| Description | When a user that doesn't have access to an issue because its View Status is set to "private" attempts to clone an issue, a POST request like the following is sent:  POST /mantisbt-2.13.0/bug\_report\_page.php HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:59.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/59.0 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Referer: <http://localhost/mantisbt-2.13.0/view.php?id=8> Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Cookie: [redacted]  bug\_report\_page\_token=201804042OfH9dLS3pONvK2XHmGLwrMJfrYjHyGz&m\_id=8  The issue is that, if the user changes the "m\_id" value to that of any of the private issues, they will be able to see all the information belonging to the targeted issue. | | | | |
| Steps To Reproduce | 1- Create an issue with the "administrator" account or similar, set it's View Status to "private". 2- Using a "Reporter" account, try to access the issue directly, notice the "Access Denied" error. 3- Using a "Reporter" account, attempt to clone an issue of that account's ownership. 4- Repeat with replacing the "m\_id" of the issue to that of the private issue, observe accessibility to the issue information. | | | | |

We usually disclose when the patch goes live with the next release. This might be delayed a bit as vboctor is currently traveling, and we have a couple other issues that need urgent fixing.  In the meanwhile I would appreciate if you could confirm that the proposed patch does fix the problem. |

Do we need the same check in bug\_report.php before calling bug\_get ?  I just tested, and while using a forged request [[1](http://path.to/mantis/bug_report.php?project_id=1&summary=test&description=clone&m_id=PRIVATE_ISSUE_ID&copy_attachments_from_parent=1&copy_notes_from_parent=1)] to call *bug\_report.php* directly does not let the user see the private issue's data itself, it still allows them to copy the bugnotes and attachments, so the vulnerability does need to be patched there as well. |

Using a crafted request on bug_report_page.php (modifying the 'm_id'
parameter), any user with REPORTER access or above is able to view any
private issue's details (summary, description, steps to reproduce,
additional information) when cloning. By checking the 'Copy issue notes'
and 'Copy attachments' checkboxes and completing the clone operation,
this data also becomes public (except private notes).

Credits to Mustafa Hasan (strukt) strukt93@gmail.com for the finding.

[@atrol](https://github.com/atrol) noted that the same vulnerability also existed in bug_report.php,
although in this case the information disclosure is limited to notes and
attachments (issue data itself does not become accessible).

Added an access level check, so that the operation now fails with an
Access Denied error in both cases.

Fixes #24221, [CVE-2018-9839](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-w7gq-xmg2-xcrj "CVE-2018-9839")
