Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9038:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation in the `filesmanager` component of Monstra CMS. Specifically, the `delete_dir` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to pass in directory traversal sequences like `./` which leads to arbitrary folder deletion.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure Permissions:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper permission checks and sanitization when handling the directory deletion request.
- **Directory Traversal:** The application fails to prevent directory traversal, allowing an attacker to delete arbitrary directories.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Folder Deletion:** A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to delete any folder on the server that the web server has access to. In the provided example, it is shown that the `uploads` folder can be deleted. This can result in data loss and disrupt the website.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a specific GET request to the `admin/index.php` file. The request needs to include the vulnerable `id=filesmanager&delete_dir=./&path=uploads` parameters.
- **Remote:** The attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely, no direct access to the server is needed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Access to the Admin Panel:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with page editing permissions.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable Monstra CMS instance.
