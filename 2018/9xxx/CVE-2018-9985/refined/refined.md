The provided content describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in MetInfo version 6.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the feedback page of MetInfo 6.0.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the feedback form, which is later executed in the administrator's browser when viewing feedback messages.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into a feedback message that is then rendered in an administratorâ€™s browser, allowing for the execution of arbitrary code.
- **Account compromise:** If the administrator views the crafted message, the attacker can potentially steal session cookies or perform actions on behalf of the administrator, potentially leading to full control over the website.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Feedback form injection:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code within the feedback page form.
- **Administrator interaction:** The administrator needs to view the feedback message for the XSS payload to be executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to access the feedback form:** The attacker can be any user who has access to the website's feedback form.
- **Ability to submit a malicious message:** The attacker must be able to submit feedback containing malicious JavaScript code.
