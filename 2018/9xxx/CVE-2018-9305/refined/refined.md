Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2018-9305:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The root cause is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the `IptcData::printStructure` function within the `iptc.c/iptc.cpp` file.
*   The vulnerability occurs due to insufficient bounds checking when handling the `len` variable. This allows the function to read past the end of allocated memory. Specifically, the issue arises in the code block that is entered when `bytes[i] == 0x1c`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** The `IptcData::printStructure` function reads data past the allocated buffer, leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A crafted image can trigger the out-of-bounds read, leading to a crash.
*   **Information Leak:** The vulnerability can lead to sensitive information being leaked.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Crafted Image File:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted image file that exploits the insufficient bounds checking in the `IptcData::printStructure` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Provide Malicious Image:** The attacker needs to provide a malicious image file to the Exiv2 application. This could be done by tricking a user into opening the image with a vulnerable application, or through some automated processing of an untrusted input stream.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerable code is located in `iptc.cpp` at the line where the code is checking for `0x1c`. The loop condition `i < size-3` is not sufficient to prevent out of bound reads in every situation.
*   Some of the documents provide debugging information that can help in identifying the vulnerable code area more precisely. For example the first github.com content shows that the crash occurs in the `Exiv2::IptcData::printStructure` function with the following code area:
```c++
   0x7ffff778bf31 <Exiv2::IptcData::printStructure(std::ostream&, unsigned char const*, unsigned long, unsigned int)+95>:       mov    edx,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x94]
   0x7ffff778bf37 <Exiv2::IptcData::printStructure(std::ostream&, unsigned char const*, unsigned long, unsigned int)+101>:      mov    rax,QWORD PTR [rbp-0xb0]
   0x7ffff778bf3e <Exiv2::IptcData::printStructure(std::ostream&, unsigned char const*, unsigned long, unsigned int)+108>:      add    rax,rdx
=> 0x7ffff778bf41 <Exiv2::IptcData::printStructure(std::ostream&, unsigned char const*, unsigned long, unsigned int)+111>:      movzx  eax,BYTE PTR [rax]
   0x7ffff778bf44 <Exiv2::IptcData::printStructure(std::ostream&, unsigned char const*, unsigned long, unsigned int)+114>:      cmp    al,0x1c
```
*   Multiple crash reports and debugging logs confirm the out-of-bounds read as the root cause of the crashes.
*   The vulnerability is present in Exiv2 version 0.26, and the fix is included in version 0.27 (and backported to 0.26).
*   Red Hat states that the versions of Exiv2 shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 (up to 7.4) were not affected by this vulnerability because they did not include support for printing IPTC Photo Metadata.
*   SUSE has provided a patch for the vulnerability in `libexiv2-26` and `libexiv2-devel` in the updated package version `0.26-6.8.1`.

In summary, CVE-2018-9305 represents an exploitable out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the `IptcData::printStructure` function of the Exiv2 library. This issue can lead to a crash and/or information leak when a crafted image file is processed.
