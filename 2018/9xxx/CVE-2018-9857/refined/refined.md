Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-9857:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the "search by ID" functionality of the "Match Clone Script" version 1.0.4. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the search field.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input within the search field, which allows for the injection of client-side scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The injected script can be executed in the context of the user's browser.
- This could lead to various malicious activities such as:
    - Stealing session cookies, potentially hijacking user accounts
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Displaying altered content or defacing the web page
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web interface of the application.
- Specifically, the vulnerability is located in the `searchbyid.php` page (aka the "View Search By Id" screen).
- An attacker can inject the malicious payload via the search field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to access the vulnerable web application and have the ability to input data into the search field on the "View Search By Id" screen.
- No special privileges or authentication is needed, and any user can trigger the vulnerability by simply inputting the crafted payload into the search field.

**Summary**
The vulnerability is a reflected XSS vulnerability in the search functionality of PHP Scripts Mall Match Clone Script 1.0.4. The application does not sanitize user inputs, allowing an attacker to execute JavaScript code in the context of the victimâ€™s browser.
