Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9059:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the Easy File Sharing Web Server version 7.2. This occurs when handling the "UserID" parameter during login.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack Buffer Overflow:**  A buffer overflow occurs when the software writes data beyond the allocated buffer size on the stack, overwriting adjacent memory locations. Specifically, the 'UserID' parameter is not properly validated and can be supplied with an overly large value.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** By exploiting the buffer overflow, an attacker can overwrite parts of the stack, including the return address. This enables the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server. This can be used for many malicious activities, including, but not limited to: gaining full control of the system, installing malware, or extracting sensitive data.
- **DEP Bypass:** The exploits provided also bypass Data Execution Prevention (DEP). This is done by using a ROP chain in order to call VirtualProtect() which is used to make the stack executable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- **HTTP Request:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/forum.ghp` endpoint. The malicious payload is placed in the `UserID` cookie.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know the specific way to trigger the buffer overflow, including the buffer size and offset.

**Technical Details**
- The exploits provided leverage a stack-based buffer overflow by overflowing the `UserID` parameter.
- The exploits include:
    - Filler bytes to reach a certain point on the stack
    - ROP chain which disables DEP and makes the stack executable
    - Shellcode that executes calc.exe
    - nSEH overwrite for stack pivoting

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit examples target Windows systems.
- The provided exploits include specific shellcode designed to execute `calc.exe` as a proof of concept.
- The `exploit-db` entries provide detailed information about the crash, including the registers' state at the time of the access violation, which shows that the instruction pointer was overwritten with 'A' characters.
