And we have attached a poc file that never finish the parsing process.   The reproduction is :  ``` mkdir obj-native cd obj-native/ git clone git://git.gnome.org/libxml2 env CFLAGS="-O2 -g -fstack-protector-all" ../configure --enable-static=yes --enable-shared=no make gdb ./xmllint (gdb) r poc -o /tmp/null Starting program: /tmp/libxml2/obj-native/xmllint poc -o /tmp/null Program received signal SIGINT, Interrupt. lzma_code (strm=strm@entry=0x761b08, action=action@entry=LZMA_FINISH) at ../../../../src/liblzma/common/common.c:247 247	../../../../src/liblzma/common/common.c: No such file or directory.

So loop condition always hold true and this loop continues.  It is not the same error with [Bug 757466](show_bug.cgi?id=757466 "RESOLVED FIXED - DoS in libxml2 if xz is enabled") or CVE-2015-8035, but similiar to it.  And the patch could be like,  +        if (ret == LZMA_MEMLIMIT_ERROR) { +            xz_error(state, LZMA_MEMLIMIT_ERROR, "memory limit error"); +            return -1; +        } ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=794914#c1)  Dongliang Mu    2018-04-03 00:58:40 UTC  ``` ``` mkdir obj-native cd obj-native/ git clone git://git.gnome.org/libxml2 ```  =>  ``` git clone git://git.gnome.org/libxml2 cd libxml2 mkdir obj-native cd obj-native/ ``` ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=794914#c2)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2018-04-04 12:31:56 UTC  ``` Doing a bisect between v2.9.4 and 7a1bd7f6497ac33a9023d556f6f47a48f01deac0 seem to indicate that the hang happens only starting with upstream commit [e2a9122b8dde53d320750451e9907a7dcb2ca8bb](https://git.gnome.org/browse/libxml2/commit/?id=e2a9122b8dde53d320750451e9907a7dcb2ca8bb)  commit [e2a9122b8dde53d320750451e9907a7dcb2ca8bb](https://git.gnome.org/browse/libxml2/commit/?id=e2a9122b8dde53d320750451e9907a7dcb2ca8bb) (refs/bisect/bad) Author: Nick Wellnhofer <wellnhofer@aevum.de> Date:   Thu Sep 7 18:36:01 2017 +0200      Set memory limit for LZMA decompression      Otherwise malicious LZMA compressed files could consume large amounts     of memory when decompressed.      According to the xz man page, files compressed with `xz -9` currently     require 65 MB to decompress, so set the limit to 100 MB.      Should fix [bug 786696](show_bug.cgi?id=786696 "RESOLVED FIXED").  $ git describe --contains e2a9122b8dde53d320750451e9907a7dcb2ca8bb v2.9.6-rc1~7 ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=794914#c3)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2018-04-08 19:07:13 UTC  ``` FTR, the scope of CVE-2018-9251 is 'is all builds of libxml2 in which "ret = lzma_code(strm, action)" (shown in 794914) can return the LZMA_MEMLIMIT_ERROR value, and trigger an infinite loop.' and so 'the call to "lzma_auto_decoder(&state->strm, UINT64_MAX, 0)" can never result in an LZMA_MEMLIMIT_ERROR outcome, because there is no way to exceed UINT64_MAX.'  The issue fixed by e2a9122b8dde53d320750451e9907a7dcb2ca8bb itself was assigned a second CVE, namely CVE-2017-18258. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=794914#c4)  Nick Wellnhofer    2018-07-30 12:52:28 UTC  ``` Fixed here: <https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/commit/2240fbf5912054af025fb6e01e26375100275e74>  Thanks for the report. ``` |  |
