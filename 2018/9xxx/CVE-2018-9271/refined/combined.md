## Details

### Description

Multiple dissectors and other modules could leak memory. The TN3270,
ISUP, LAPD, SMB2, GIOP, ASN.1, MIME multipart, H.223, and PCP
dissectors were affected along with Wireshark and TShark.
Discovered by Otto Airamo and Antti Levomäki, Forcepoint.

## Impact

It may be possible to make Wireshark
crash

by injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or
by convincing
someone to read a malformed packet trace file.

## Resolution

Upgrade to Wireshark 2.4.6, 2.2.14 or later.
