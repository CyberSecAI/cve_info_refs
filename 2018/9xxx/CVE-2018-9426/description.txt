In  RsaKeyPairGenerator::getNumberOfIterations of RSAKeyPairGenerator.java, an incorrect implementation could cause weak RSA key pairs being generated. This could lead to crypto vulnerability with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Bulletin Fix: The fix is designed to correctly implement the key generation according to FIPS standard.
