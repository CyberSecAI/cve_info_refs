{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The number of iterations used to confirm a number is prime was based on the length of the key rather than the length of the factors p and q.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure prime number calculation in RSA key generation.",
      "Insufficient iterations for primality testing."
    ],
    "impact": "Lower-than-expected confidence in the primality of the key factors, potentially weakening the security of generated RSA keys.",
    "attack_vectors": "Exploitation requires the use of a vulnerable implementation of RSA key generation.",
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker would need to be able to influence the key generation process or exploit weaknesses based on the reduced confidence in the primality of key factors."
