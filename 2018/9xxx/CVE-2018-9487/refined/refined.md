Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9487:

**Summary:**

CVE-2018-9487 is a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability in the Android System component, specifically related to the processing of L2CAP packets.  A specially crafted L2CAP packet with invalid length can trigger the vulnerability.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of the L2CAP packet data length. The system fails to handle an invalid data length when processing L2CAP packets.
*   **Weakness:** Missing or inadequate input validation. Specifically, the code does not correctly verify that the data length specified in an L2CAP packet is valid before processing it.
*   **Impact:** A successful exploit can lead to a Denial of Service condition. The vulnerable component will crash or become unresponsive when processing the malformed packet, thus disrupting the normal operation of the affected Android device.
*  **Attack Vector:** Sending a specially crafted L2CAP packet with an invalid length to the device.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the vulnerable device over a Bluetooth connection and be able to send custom L2CAP packets.
