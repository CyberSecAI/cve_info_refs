### Description

A vulnerability exists in the Management web interface that could allow local privilege escalation. The Management web interface does not properly validate specific request parameters, which can potentially allow deletion of files in the system. (Ref. # PAN-90954; CVE-2018-9242)

Successful exploitation of this issue requires the attacker to be authenticated.

This issue affects PAN-OS 6.1.20 and earlier, PAN-OS 7.1.16 and earlier, PAN-OS 8.0.9 and earlier. PAN-OS 8.1 is not affected.

### Product Status

| Versions | Affected | Unaffected |
| PAN-OS 8.0 | <= 8.0.9 | >= 8.0.10 |
| PAN-OS 7.1 | <= 7.1.16 | >= 7.1.17 |
| PAN-OS 6.1 | <= 6.1.20 | >= 6.1.21 |

### Severity: MEDIUM

CVSSv3.1
Base Score:
5.5 ([CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N](https://cvssjs.github.io/#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N))

### Weakness Type

[CWE-20 Improper Input Validation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20 "More at https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20")

### Solution

PAN-OS 6.1.21 and later, PAN-OS 7.1.17 and later, PAN-OS 8.0.10 and later

### Workarounds and Mitigations

This issue affects the web-based management interface of PAN-OS andis strongly mitigated by following best practices for securing the management interface of PAN-OS. Our best practices guidelines reduce the exposure of the management interface to potential attackers. Please review the Best Practices for Securing Administrative Access in the PAN-OS technical documentation, available at: <https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/documentation/80/pan-os/pan-os/getting-started/best-practices-for-securing-administrative-access>.
