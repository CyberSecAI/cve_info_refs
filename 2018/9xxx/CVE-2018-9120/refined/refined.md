Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9120:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and validation in the Crea8Social Social Network Script, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, both stored and reflected.
    - **Stored XSS:** Present in user comments, user profiles, and posts. This means that the malicious script is saved within the application and executed when other users view the affected content.
    - **Reflected XSS:** Present in the search feature. The malicious script is injected via the search parameter and executed when the victim clicks on the search result.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Escalation of Privileges:** Attackers can create a normal user account, then exploit the XSS vulnerabilities to hijack an admin account, leading to a complete takeover of the installation.
- **Client-Side JS Code Execution:** Attackers can inject malicious JS code that executes on other users' browsers, potentially leading to various harmful actions.
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can steal sensitive information such as session cookies and private information from other user accounts by executing client-side JavaScript.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Stored XSS:**
    - Injecting malicious scripts within comments, user profiles, and posts.
    - The injected scripts are then executed when users interact with the affected content.
- **Reflected XSS:**
    - Injecting malicious scripts via search parameters (e.g., `search?term=%22%20onmousemove=%22alert(document.domain)%22`).
    - The script is executed when a user submits the search query.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a user account on the Crea8Social platform.
- They can be a normal user.
- They need to inject a malicious script into the vulnerable fields (comments, user profiles, posts, search parameter).
