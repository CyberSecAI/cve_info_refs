During a quick trial security assessment (not fully tested) of Crea8Social Social Network Script our team at Seekurity.com SAS de C.V. identified several severe Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerabilities in the platform that been widely used on the internet to create your own social network website (BTW this script used in the alleged new Egyptian Facebook named as EgFace.com). Our team responsibly contacted the vendor of the script but we got no answer and based on our Seekurity responsible disclosure rules which is a 90-day-disclosure-deadline or NON-Responsive vendor the bug details became visible to the public through our official communication channels.

[Crea8Social Pro Social Network Script- Stored and Reflected XSS (Sample Test)](https://vimeo.com/285038466) from [Mohamed A. Baset](https://vimeo.com/user57605837) on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com).

**[-] Attack Vectors:**

– Escalation of Privileges: A normal user can create a bogus (user) account on Crea8Social platform hence hijack the Admin’s account and takeover the whole installation.

– Client Side JS Code Execution: A normal user can create a bogus (user) account on Crea8Social platform with a stored XSS attack vector which will lead to execute JS code on behalf of all the user types passing by the attacker’s public user profile page.

– Information Disclosure: A normal user can create a bogus (user) account on Crea8Social platform with a rough stored XSS attack vector to perform client side js code execution on other users sessions hence steal their session cookie or their private information from their accounts.

**[-] Fix Suggestion:**

Filter and sanitize all the user supplied inputs.
