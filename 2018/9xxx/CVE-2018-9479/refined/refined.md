### Android Security Bulletinâ€”September 2018
This document provides details of security vulnerabilities affecting Android devices, specifically those addressed by the 2018-09-01 and 2018-09-05 security patch levels.

### Vulnerability Details for CVE-2018-9479
- **Component:** System (Bluetooth)
- **Type:** Elevation of Privilege (EoP)
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Updated AOSP versions:** 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, 8.1, 9
- **References:**
    - A-79217770: [https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/bt/%2B/68688194eade113ad31687a730e8d4102ada58d5](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/bt/%2B/68688194eade113ad31687a730e8d4102ada58d5)

### Root Cause:
- The vulnerability is located in the Bluetooth system component. 
- A code change related to this issue is linked in the references, which indicates a potential error related to handling attribute lengths and offsets within the Bluetooth stack. The commit message from the git link states: "SDP: return error on offset bigger than attribute length." This indicates the vulnerability could be triggered if an offset value in an SDP request is larger than the attribute's length, potentially allowing an attacker to manipulate the attribute access.

### Weaknesses:
- The primary weakness lies in the insufficient validation of offset values in Service Discovery Protocol (SDP) requests.

### Impact:
- Exploitation could lead to a local attacker bypassing user interaction requirements to gain access to additional permissions. The severity is critical, meaning it has a high potential for significant impact.

### Attack Vectors:
- A local attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted SDP request with an offset larger than the attribute length, to an affected device.

### Required Attacker Capabilities:
- The attacker needs to be a local user or application on the device. 
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted bluetooth requests.
