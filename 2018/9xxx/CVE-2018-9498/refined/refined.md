Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9498:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is related to a flaw in the Skia graphics library, specifically how it handles memory allocation. The commit messages indicate changes related to merging allocators into `sk_malloc_flags`, adding helper functions, and using `SkSafeMath::Mul` for size calculations. There's a mention of changes to `NewFromStream` to use `sk_malloc_canfail`. The core issue seems to be related to how the library handles size calculations during memory allocation, potentially leading to integer overflows and heap overflows.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to trigger a heap-based buffer overflow. This happens because the size calculation of memory needed is incorrect, resulting in a buffer that's too small being allocated, followed by writing past its bounds.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process. This is the most severe impact, as it gives the attacker full control over the targeted device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially crafted file:** The attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing a specially crafted file. This suggests that the vulnerable code path is triggered when processing certain file types handled by the Skia library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote attacker:** The attacker can be remote and doesn't need physical access to the device.
- **Ability to deliver a malicious file:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver a specially crafted file to the device that triggers the vulnerable code within the Skia library. This could potentially be achieved through various means, such as:
     - Malicious apps.
     - Compromised websites serving malicious files.
     - Delivery via messaging apps.
     - Other methods where the device processes attacker-controlled data.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is rated as **Critical** severity.
- It affects Android versions 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, and 8.1, indicating a wide range of vulnerable devices.
- The fix involves changes to the memory allocation handling within the Skia library, including using safer math operations and improved error handling for memory allocation failures.
-  The provided commit messages from android.googlesource.com indicate that the fix also addresses potential integer overflow issues during the calculation of memory allocation sizes.

The content provides more detail than the typical CVE description by pinpointing the vulnerable code to the Skia graphics library, highlighting the root cause as incorrect memory allocation, and specifying that the vulnerability is triggered via a specially crafted file leading to RCE, which are usually not specified in the official CVE descriptions
