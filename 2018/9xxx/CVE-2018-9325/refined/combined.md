# Important critical Etherpad release – 1.6.4

Posted by[John McLear](https://blog.etherpad.org/author/john/) [April 7, 2018April 8, 2018](https://blog.etherpad.org/2018/04/07/important-release-1-6-4/)
[1 Comment on Important critical Etherpad release – 1.6.4](https://blog.etherpad.org/2018/04/07/important-release-1-6-4/#comments)

**TLDR; Site admins should Update ASAP to 1.6.4 due to several security enhancements.**

Today we released [Etherpad 1.6.4](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/).

This release fixes several security vulnerabilities in recent versions:

* One is an arbitrary code execution vulnerability in version 1.6.3.
* Another is an arbitrary code execution vulnerability which is present in all versions from 1.5.0 on, but only exploitable on sites that store pads in DirtyDB, CouchDB, MongoDB, or RethinkDB.
* A third allows attackers to export any pad without knowing its name (as normally required) in all versions from 1.5.0 on.

**The Etherpad Leadership Team recommends that administrators upgrade to 1.6.4 as soon as possible to mitigate these issues.**

> “Etherpad is key to a number of organization that promote collaboration, freedom and transparency and as such we are proud to provide infrastructure for these values,”

said John McLear, Etherpad’s chief maintainer.

> “In a world that is becoming more fragmented, we’re very keen to promote global collaboration and are dedicated to improving the security of Etherpad.”
