Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   SQL Injection vulnerability
*   Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   SQL Injection: Allows an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries.
*   Reflected XSS: Allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Exposure of user information stored in the database.
    
**Attack Vectors:**
*   SQL injection is typically exploited by injecting malicious SQL code through input fields or URL parameters.
*  Reflected XSS vulnerabilities are typically exploited by crafting malicious URLs or other input that, when processed by the server, injects malicious scripts into the response, leading to script execution on client browsers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*  For SQL injection, the attacker needs to be able to submit malicious queries to the application.
*   For XSS, the attacker needs to craft malicious input that will be reflected back by the application in a way that allows script execution.
    
**Affected Products and Versions:**
*   MiVoice Connect: R1707-PREM SP1 (21.84.5535.0) and earlier
