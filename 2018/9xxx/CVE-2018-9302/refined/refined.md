Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the `fuc.js.php` file of the Cockpit CMS. This file takes a `url` parameter that is not properly validated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insufficient URL Validation:** The application fails to properly sanitize and validate the provided URL, allowing an attacker to supply arbitrary URLs.
- **Bypass of Previous Fix:** A previous fix for CVE-2017-14611 was bypassed, indicating a lack of comprehensive security measures.
- **Lack of Protocol Restriction:** The application doesn't properly restrict the protocols used in the URL, allowing protocols like gopher, dict, etc., when curl is available. If curl isn't available it still allows the use of http, https, and ftp.
- **Reliance on `allow_url_fopen`:** When curl is not available the vulnerability depends on the `allow_url_fopen` option being enabled in php.ini (which is enabled by default) which is a security risk.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** Attackers can potentially read arbitrary files from the server.
- **Intranet Host Interaction:** Attackers can send TCP traffic to intranet hosts.
- **Port Scanning:** Attackers can scan ports on internal networks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious GET request to `/assets/lib/fuc.js.php` with a crafted `url` parameter.
- **Attacker Controlled Server:** The attack involves a malicious PHP file on an attacker controlled server that redirects the request to a malicious target.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs remote access to the vulnerable Cockpit CMS instance.
- **Ability to Host a Malicious PHP File:** The attacker requires a server to host a malicious PHP redirect file.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability is located in `/assets/lib/fuc.js.php`.
- The `url` parameter in the request is used to fetch data from a remote server, this is not properly validated.
- The attacker can control the URL to redirect the request to internal or external resources.
- The attacker's malicious PHP file on their server can redirect to other protocols such as `gopher://`, `dict://` etc. if the server has `curl` enabled.

**Affected Versions:**
- Cockpit CMS versions 0.4.4 to 0.5.5.

**Fix:**
The provided fix involves the following:
- Implement proper URL validation using `filter_var($url, FILTER_VALIDATE_URL)`.
- Restrict URL schemes to `http://` and `https://` via `preg_match('#^http(|s)\://#', $url)`.
- Private IP filtering using `filter_var($ip, FILTER_VALIDATE_IP, FILTER_FLAG_NO_PRIV_RANGE)`.
- Disabling `CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION` to prevent redirects.
