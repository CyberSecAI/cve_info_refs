- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper authentication checks before granting access to certain pages within the SharePort Web Access Portal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authentication bypass.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to media stored in SharePort and potentially perform write operations, leading to remote access and modification of files.
- **Attack vectors:** Attackers can directly call authenticated URLs (e.g., /category_view.php, /folder_view.php) by bypassing the login authentication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to know the router's IP address and port and does not require prior authentication.
