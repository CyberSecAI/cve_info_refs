{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied offsets in the ebtables module when CONFIG_COMPAT is enabled.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The ebtables module, when handling 32-bit compatibility mode rulesets, did not sufficiently validate offsets provided by userland. Specifically, the code did not check if the provided offsets were within the total size of the relevant structure and if the offsets were in ascending order. This lack of validation could lead to out-of-bounds reads/writes.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially trigger out-of-bounds memory access due to the flawed offset handling, leading to a system crash (denial of service) or potentially more severe consequences like privilege escalation or arbitrary code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting malicious ebtables rulesets, specifically when using a 32bit ebtables binary, that contain carefully chosen out-of-bound or improperly ordered offsets. The attacker needs to have the capability to provide crafted ebtables rules to the system, which usually requires root or administrative privileges.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to have the capability to set ebtables rules, generally requiring root or administrative privileges. They also need to use a 32-bit ebtables binary when CONFIG_COMPAT is enabled."
