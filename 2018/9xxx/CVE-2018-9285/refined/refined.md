{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "OS command injection via unsanitized parameters passed to the /apply.cgi",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of sanitization of input parameters (pingCNT and destIP) in the Main_Analysis_Content.asp, which are used to construct an OS command. A web proxy can bypass local checks, and the command is executed without further server-side validation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands with root privileges on the affected router.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves sending a malicious HTTP request to the vulnerable /apply.cgi endpoint, injecting OS commands via the unsanitized parameters.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to either have access to the web management portal (e.g., via WAN if exposed) or trick the user into following a malicious link. The attacker also needs a valid authentication token from the HTTP Cookie header."
