    "Root cause": "Malformed input data on the service pipe towards the OpenVPN interactive service can result in a double free() in the error handling code.",
    "Weaknesses": [

    ],
    "Impact": "Denial-of-service through memory corruption or possibly have unspecified other impact including privilege escalation.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending a malformed request to the interactive service via a pipe.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "Local attacker with the ability to send data over the pipe to the openvpnserv.exe service."
