## Build 4110

Released on  Jan 08, 2015

#### New Features:

**Multi domain support:** RecoveryManager Plus now allows you to backup & restore all AD objects across multiple domains from a single window. It gives you a holistic view of all objects present in different domains and enables you to manage them efficiently.

**Password Recovery:** With this new feature, recover the last set password of the user account along with all the other AD attributes of the user during restoration or rollback, thereby enabling the users to resume work without any hitch. Also, when a modified computer account is recovered or restored, this feature enables you to automatically link it to the domain with the password last set on the computer.

Note: This option is configurable.

**Force Replication on backup & recovery:** This feature force replicates the data in all Domain Controllers when any backup operation is initialized. This ensures that modifications made to the objects in all Domain Controllers before the replication cycle are reflected in the Backup giving you the actual state of the objects during backups.

When Recovery operations are performed, RecoveryManager Plus will push the updated information to all Domain Controllers in the domain by forcing the replication. This feature makes sure that all Domain Controllers contain the updated information as soon as any recovery operation is performed irrespective of the replication cycle time.

Note:

* This option is configurable for both Backup & Recovery
* For this functionality to work, the machine where the RMP product is installed should be joined in any AD domain.

**Rollback enhancements:** With this update of RecoveryManager Plus, enjoy the revamped user interface of Rollback feature.

The new User Interface allows you to trigger multiple rollback operations simultaneously and keep track of the progress of all rollbacks in the same window.

Moreover, a new backup will be taken before performing the rollback operation. This ensures that the current state of AD objects will be backed up before doing the recovery operation.

**Backup enhancements:** With this feature, when a particular object is modified frequently, RecoveryManager Plus creates a full backup for that particular object. This ensures faster rollback in case of any data modifications on that object.

Even more, you can track all the backup progress right from your dashboard! A single view of your dashboard provides you with all the vital statistics of your backup environment.

**Forgot password option:** This new update allows users to reset the password of RecoveryManager Plus if they have forgotten their passwords. The process requires you to run a .exe file which will reset the password of the administrator to its default password.

**BackLink properties handling:** With this update, any change done to attributes that have backlinks, like User Group Membership, are captured in both the User and Group object. In simpler terms, it is stored in both the forward link object (User) and the backward link object (Group). This functionality provides clear tracking of object history. This allows the administrators to restore modified user accounts along with their group memberships and vice-versa.

**Free version update:** Previous editions of RecoveryManager Plus limited the backup of AD objects to 50 users. The updated version provides you with unrestricted backup and restore for any number of deleted AD objects.

## Build 4100

**Recovery of AD Groups, Computers and Contacts:** Using the recovery feature, you can now restore/rollback AD groups, computers and contacts too, to an earlier state/version. This feature makes it possible to recover AD groups, computers and contacts also, either completely or partially (only the required attributes), as per your need.

**Object-based filter in backed-up objects search:** While restoring/rolling back AD objects, this new filter makes it easy to locate the desired backed-up objects. Using this filter, you can restrict the scope of the search to only the specific types of AD objects that you need.

**BitLocker Keys Recovery:** You no longer have to worry about losing data from BitLocker-protected drives, as this feature enables you to backup the BitLocker recovery keys stored in AD, along with all the changes made to them. Whenever needed, you can always revert to an earlier version of the key and use it to recover the data from the encrypted drives.

## Build 4000

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
