Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9564:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds read in the llcp (Logical Link Control Protocol) code within the NFC (Near Field Communication) subsystem.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the llcp code, specifically in "llcp code part 2" as mentioned in one of the commit messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially read data from memory locations outside the intended boundaries, leading to information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is present in the NFC subsystem, which suggests the attack vector involves malicious NFC interactions. The content indicates the issue affects tag reading, card emulation, and potentially Android Beam.
- An attacker could exploit this by sending specially crafted NFC data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be within NFC range of a vulnerable device.
- They would require the capability to send malicious NFC data to trigger the out-of-bounds read.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided commits reference multiple bugs, including 114238578, 114237888, and 111660010, suggesting that this fix addresses several related issues.
- The fix modifies `llcp_util.cc` and `llcp_link.cc` to resolve the out-of-bounds read issues.
- The commits mention tests that include NFC enable/disable, Android Beam, and tag reading, implying that these functionalities are relevant to the vulnerability.
