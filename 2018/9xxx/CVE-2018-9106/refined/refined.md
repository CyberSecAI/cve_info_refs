Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-9106

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a CSV injection, also known as Excel Macro Injection or Formula Injection. This occurs because the AcySMS extension mishandles values during CSV export.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper sanitization of user-supplied data before exporting to CSV format.
- The exported CSV file contains formulas or macros that are executed when opened in a spreadsheet program like Excel.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- When a user opens the malicious CSV file, the injected formulas get executed.
- This can lead to arbitrary command execution on the victim's machine.
- In the proof of concept, a calculator is launched, but more malicious commands could be injected.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack requires a low-privileged user with access to the AcySMS component.
- The attacker injects a malicious formula into a field, such as the user's name.
- A higher-privileged user must then export the user data to a CSV file.
- The exploit is triggered when the high-privilege user opens the CSV file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attacker needs an account with low privileges in the Joomla system with access to AcySMS component.
- Ability to modify user data, specifically a field that will be exported.
- The attacker must rely on another, higher-privileged user to export the manipulated data and open it, triggering the exploit.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable software is the AcySMS component for Joomla!, specifically versions before 3.5.1.
- The provided exploit details a specific formula, `@SUM(1+1)*cmd|' /C calc'!A0`, for demonstration.
- The exploit is triggered when the exported CSV is opened using software such as Excel.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 3.5.1.
