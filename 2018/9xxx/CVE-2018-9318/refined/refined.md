  "ID": "CVE-2018-9318",
  "content": "The provided content includes information about multiple vulnerabilities discovered in BMW vehicles by Tencent's Keen Security Lab. One of these vulnerabilities is identified as CVE-2018-9318. \n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability is located within the infotainment unit's software. Specifically, a \"backdoor\" in the infotainment unit allows a USB connection to bypass the system and directly access the vehicle's K-CAN bus. This backdoor is related to the reuse of some Texas Instruments code “to operate the special memory of Jacinto chip to send the CAN messages.” \n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n*   **Backdoor in Infotainment Unit:** The presence of an exploitable backdoor allows unauthorized access from the infotainment unit to the K-CAN bus. The article doesn't clarify if it's a hardcoded credential, admin account, or other weakness. \n*   **Lack of Diagnostic Function Security:** The vehicle's ECUs respond to diagnostic messages even when the vehicle is operating normally. Attackers can use this to invoke special UDS routines (e.g., reset ECU), causing serious security issues.\n*   **Vulnerable CAN Bus Communication:** Flaws in the CAN bus communication allow messages injected via the infotainment system to reach the engine control unit, which could be used to interfere with or take over vehicle operation. This is related to the reuse of some Texas Instruments code.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Access to Critical Vehicle Systems:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to gain access to the vehicle's K-CAN bus, potentially enabling the manipulation of various vehicle systems, including the engine control unit and other critical components.\n*   **Remote Code Execution:** Attackers could achieve remote code execution in the telematics unit firmware, which could further compromise the vehicle.\n*   **Control of Vehicle Operations:** By injecting messages into the CAN bus, attackers can interfere with or take over the vehicle's operation. It is possible to trigger BMW Remote Services with arbitrary messages via a simulated GSM network, which may lead to unauthorized access and control.\n*   **Data theft:** Once inside the infotainment system the vehicle, data could be stolen from the system\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   **Physical USB Access:** Exploiting the backdoor vulnerability can be done by plugging a malicious USB device into the infotainment unit's USB port.\n*   **Wireless/Bluetooth Attacks:** Attackers can exploit a vulnerability in the infotainment system by using a Bluetooth connection from outside the vehicle. \n*    **Cellular Network Attacks:** Attackers can gain access via the cellular network and inject messages to the vehicle's CAN bus.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   **Physical Access:** To exploit the USB backdoor vulnerability, an attacker would require physical access to the vehicle's USB port.  For diagnostic port access, the attacker must also have physical access to the vehicle.\n*   **Proximity:** Bluetooth attacks can be performed by an attacker within Bluetooth range of the vehicle.\n*  **Network Access**: Access to cellular network to inject arbitrary diagnostic messages to the CAN buses in the vehicle.\n*   **Technical Knowledge:** Exploitation requires a solid understanding of CAN bus communication, vehicle diagnostic protocols and also reverse-engineering to perform the attacks described above."
