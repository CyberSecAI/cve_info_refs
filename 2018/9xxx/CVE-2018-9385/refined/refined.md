  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `thread_info` struct was moved from the task stack to the `task_struct`, which could expose the `thread_info` to corruption due to stack overflows. It also makes the address of `thread_info` harder to determine.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Potential stack overflow leading to `thread_info` corruption",
      "Exposure of `thread_info` address"
    ],
    "impact": "By preventing corruption of the `thread_info` struct, and making it harder to find the `thread_info` address, some exploitation techniques become more difficult.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Stack overflow",
       "Address leak"
