Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9536:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `libxaac` library, specifically due to an integer overflow in the bit buffer handling.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Integer Overflow:** A bit counter overflow could occur in the bit buffer, which could cause unexpected behavior when using the bit buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** The vulnerability is categorized as an Elevation of Privilege, meaning it could allow an attacker to gain more privileges than they should have.
- **Critical Severity:** The vulnerability is rated as having "Critical" severity, indicating a severe security flaw.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local:** The vulnerability is exploitable via a local attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- A local attacker with the ability to run malicious applications.

**Additional Notes:**
- The `libxaac` library was experimental and is no longer included in production Android builds, which indicates a measure taken to mitigate this issue.
- Patches for this vulnerability have been released to AOSP.
- The provided commits address the bit counter overflow and replaces the counter with a safer method call `FDkGetValidBits()`.
