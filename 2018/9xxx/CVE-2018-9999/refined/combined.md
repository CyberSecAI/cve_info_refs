# Zulip 1.7.2 security release

  [![](/_astro/tabbott.Y0j5haym_Z1qaMxj.webp)](author/tabbott/)  [Tim Abbott](author/tabbott/)   Apr 12, 2018 • 2 min read

Today we’re releasing Zulip Server 1.7.2. This is a security release, containing
just a handful of cherry-picked changes since 1.7.1.

## What’s new

This release fixes several security issues:

* CVE-2018-9986: Fix XSS issues with frontend markdown processor.
* CVE-2018-9987: Fix XSS issue with muting notifications.
* CVE-2018-9990: Fix XSS issue with stream names in topic typeahead.
* CVE-2018-9999: Fix XSS issue with user uploads and the (default)
  `LOCAL_UPLOADS_DIR` storage backend.

CVE-2018-9987 was introduced in Zulip 1.5.0; the other three issues were present
in the first public release of Zulip. None of these issues were publicly known
before today.

Thanks to Suhas Sunil Gaikwad for reporting CVE-2018-9987 and w9w for reporting
CVE-2018-9986 and CVE-2018-9990.

## Upgrading

All users should upgrade promptly to secure their systems. See the
[upgrade instructions](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/maintain-secure-upgrade.html#upgrading)
in the Zulip documentation.

If you’re upgrading from 1.7.1, then the code changes are small and there are no
migrations or dependency changes, so the risk of unexpected disruption is low.

If you need help, best-effort support is available on
[chat.zulip.org, the Zulip community chat server](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/chat-zulip-org.html).
