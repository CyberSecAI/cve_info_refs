Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9115:

**Summary:**
The provided content confirms that CVE-2018-9115 is a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability affecting Systematic's SitAware NVG interface, which allows an attacker to freeze the application's situational layer.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient input validation within Systematic's SitAware when processing data from external sources, specifically through its NVG interface. The application does not properly sanitize or validate the incoming data, leading to the denial-of-service condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient input validation: The application does not properly validate the data it receives through the NVG interface.
- Lack of proper error handling: The application does not gracefully handle malformed or unexpected data, leading to a freeze of the situational layer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a freeze of the Situational Layer in SitAware, preventing users from receiving real-time updates. This can severely impair the application's usability and render it ineffective in critical situations.
- The user will not be aware of the issue until attempting to work with the situational layer.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending malicious SOAP messages to the SitAware NVG interface.
- Specifically, the exploit focuses on sending malicious NVG data through SOAP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network connectivity: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the SitAware NVG interface.
- Ability to craft SOAP requests: The attacker needs to be able to generate SOAP messages that include malicious NVG data.
- Knowledge of the target application's NVG interface: The attacker needs knowledge of the NVG interface to make valid requests and send the payload.
- The provided exploit uses `bottle.py` to create a dummy NVG server that sends the malicious data.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit requires the `bottle` Python library.
- The exploit code sends crafted XML data to simulate a malicious response from an NVG server when specific actions, 'GetCapabilities' and 'GetNvg', are requested.
