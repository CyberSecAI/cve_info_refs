Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-9555

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the Bluetooth subsystem (`/system/bt`)
- Specifically, it is related to how the system handles lower bound checks during memory allocation
- The commit message indicates "Check SDU lower bound before allocate p_data" implying a missing or insufficient check of the size of a Service Data Unit (SDU) before allocating memory for it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** Lack of proper size validation on the SDU before memory allocation leading to potential buffer overflows
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, suggesting an attack vector involving crafted Bluetooth packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process. This could result in full device compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be triggered remotely via a crafted Bluetooth transmission
- **Specially Crafted Transmission:** The attacker needs to send a specially crafted Bluetooth packet that exploits the size validation flaw.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range of the target device.
- **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of Bluetooth protocols and the vulnerability details to craft the malicious packets.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided commit link indicates a fix was made to check the SDU lower bound before allocating memory.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" severity due to the potential for remote code execution.
- Affected versions include Android 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, 8.1 and 9.
