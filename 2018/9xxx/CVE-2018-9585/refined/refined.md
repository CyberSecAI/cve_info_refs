Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9585:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds (OOB) error in the `nfc_ncif_proc_get_routing()` function within the NFC (Near Field Communication) component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-Bounds Read/Write:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read or write operation. This occurs when the software tries to access a memory location outside the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** This vulnerability can be exploited by a local attacker to achieve an elevation of privilege.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Malicious Application:** A malicious application residing on the device can exploit this vulnerability.
- The specific attack vector involves tag reading and card emulation within the NFC component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to install and run a malicious application on the targeted device.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided commit message highlights that the vulnerability is specifically present in the `nfc_ncif_proc_get_routing()` function.
- The fix was implemented to prevent an out-of-bounds read or write by correcting the handling of the configuration status in `nfc_ncif_set_config_status`.
- The fix also includes changes to prevent the OOB error in `nfc_ncif_proc_get_routing()`.
- The vulnerability was found during testing involving NFC Enable/Disable, Android Beam, and tag reading.

The provided commit diffs further confirm that the vulnerability is in the NFC component and has been addressed in the AOSP code.
