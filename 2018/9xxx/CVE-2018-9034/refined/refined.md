Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9034:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the Relevanssi WordPress plugin not properly escaping the value of the `tab` parameter from the `$_GET` request before including it in the HTML output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin directly uses the unsanitized `tab` parameter in an HTML attribute, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the browser of a logged-in WordPress administrator.
- **Potential for Account Takeover/Remote Code Execution:** This could lead to the creation of new admin users, potentially leading to remote code execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Link:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in WordPress administrator into clicking a crafted link containing the malicious payload in the `tab` parameter.
- **Browsing a Malicious URL:** Alternatively, the admin could be tricked into directly browsing a malicious URL under attacker's control.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to lure a logged-in WordPress administrator to interact with a malicious link or URL.
- **No Prior Authentication Needed:** The vulnerability is exploitable as long as the targeted admin user is logged into WordPress.

**Technical Details**
- The vulnerable code is located in `relevanssi/lib/interface.php` at line 1055:
  ```php
  1049 if( isset( $_REQUEST[ 'tab' ] ) ) {
  1050 $active_tab = $_REQUEST[ 'tab' ];
  1051 } // end if
  1052
  1053 if ($active_tab === "stopwords") $display_save_button = false;
  1054
  1055 echo "<input type='hidden' name='tab' value='$active_tab' />";
  ```
- The exploit uses JavaScript obfuscation within the HTML attribute value to avoid WordPress escaping.

**Additional Notes:**

- The exploit-db entry provides a proof-of-concept URL demonstrating the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 4.1 of the plugin.
- The provided content confirms that the vulnerability was a reflected XSS issue.
