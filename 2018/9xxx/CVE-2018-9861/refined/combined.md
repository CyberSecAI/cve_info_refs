⚠️️️ **CKEditor 4 (the open source edition) is no longer maintained.** ⚠️

If you would like to keep access to future CKEditor 4 security patches, check the [Extended Support Model](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-4-support/), which guarantees **security updates and critical bug fixes until December 2026**. Alternatively, [upgrade to CKEditor 5](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/updating/ckeditor4/migration-from-ckeditor-4.html).

## CKEditor 4.25.0-lts

⚠️️️ Please note that this release is a part of [CKEditor 4 Extended Support Model](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-4-support/), only available to customers who decided to acquire the LTS (Long Term Support) version of the editor. **All editor versions below 4.25.0-lts can no longer be considered as secure!** ⚠️

**Security Updates:**

* Fixed reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in [Code Snippet GeSHi](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/codesnippetgeshi) plugin reported by [Jiasheng He](https://github.com/Hebing123) from Qihoo 360.

  Issue summary: The vulnerability allowed a reflected XSS attack by exploiting a flaw in the [GeSHi syntax highlighter library](https://github.com/GeSHi/geshi-1.0) hosted by the victim. The GeSHi library was included as a vendor dependency in CKEditor 4 source files. In a specific scenario, an attacker could craft a malicious script that could be executed by sending a request to the GeSHi library hosted on a PHP web server. See [GHA](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/security/advisories/GHSA-7r32-vfj5-c2jv) for more details.
* Fixed low-risk cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability linked to potential domain takeover

  Issue summery: A theoretical vulnerability has been identified in CKEditor 4.22 (and above). In a highly unlikely scenario where an attacker gains control over the <https://cke4.ckeditor.com> domain, they could potentially execute an attack on CKEditor 4 instances. Although the vulnerability is purely hypothetical, we have addressed it in CKEditor 4.25.0-lts to ensure compliance with security best practices. See [GHA](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/security/advisories/GHSA-6v96-m24v-f58j) for more details.

You can read more details in the relevant security advisories. [Contact us](/ckeditor/ckeditor4/blob/master/security%40cksource.com) if you have more questions.

**An upgrade is highly recommended!**

Updated dependencies:

* **CodeMirror** (used only in the [Toolbar Configurator](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/features/toolbar.html#toolbar-configurator) in samples) has been updated to v5.65.17 for improved stability and performance.
* **Highlight.js** (used by the [Code Snippet](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/codesnippet) plugin) has been updated to v11.9.0, introducing **two breaking changes**:

  + dropped support for Internet Explorer,
  + updated list of the supported themes – some of the themes are no longer officially supported, others may have their names changed (e.g. `monokai_sublime` is now `monokai-sublime`). Please verify the value of your [`config.codeSnippet_theme`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-codeSnippet_theme) configuration option and adjust theme names as needed. The list of available themes can be checked in the `plugins/codesnippet/lib/highlight/styles` directory.

## CKEditor 4.24.0-lts

⚠️️️ Please note that this release is a part of [CKEditor 4 Extended Support Model](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-4-support/), only available to customers who decided to acquire the LTS (Long Term Support) version of the editor. **All editor versions below 4.24.0-lts can no longer be considered as secure!** ⚠️

**Security Updates:**

* Fixed cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability caused by incorrect CDATA detection reported by [Michal Frýba](https://cz.linkedin.com/in/michal-fryba), [ALEF NULA](https://www.alefnula.com/).

  Issue summary: The vulnerability allowed to inject malformed HTML content bypassing Advanced Content Filtering mechanism, which could result in executing JavaScript code. See [GHA](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/security/advisories/GHSA-fq6h-4g8v-qqvm) for more details.
* Fixed cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in AJAX sample reported by Rafael Pedrero, see [INCIBE](https://www.incibe.es/en/incibe-cert/notices/aviso/cross-site-scripting-vulnerability-cksource-ckeditor) report.

  Issue summary: The vulnerability allowed to execute JavaScript code by abusing the AJAX sample. See [GHA](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/security/advisories/GHSA-wh5w-82f3-wrxh) for more details.
* Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in samples with enabled the preview feature reported by [Marcin Wyczechowski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcin-wyczechowski-0a823795/) & [Michał Majchrowicz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/micha%C5%82-majchrowicz-mwsc/) [AFINE Team](https://afine.com/).

  Issue summary: The vulnerability allowed to execute JavaScript code by abusing the misconfigured preview feature. See [GHA](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/security/advisories/GHSA-mw2c-vx6j-mg76) for more details.

You can read more details in the relevant security advisories. [Contact us](/ckeditor/ckeditor4/blob/master/security%40cksource.com) if you have more questions.

**An upgrade is highly recommended!**

Fixed Issues:

* Fixed: The CDATA parsing mechanism incorrectly detects the end of CDATA content. This fix unifies how style and script elements are parsed with the browser's behavior.

## CKEditor 4.23.0-lts

This release introduces the LTS (”Long Term Support”) version of the editor, available under commercial terms (["Extended Support Model"](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-4-support/)).

If you acquired the Extended Support Model for CKEditor 4 LTS, please read [the CKEditor 4 LTS key activation guide.](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/support/licensing/license-key-and-activation.html)

## CKEditor 4.22.0 / 4.22.1

⚠️ This is the last open source release of CKEditor 4. As announced in 2018, CKEditor 4 has reached its End of Life in June 2023.

New Features:

* [#5316](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5316): Added vertical margins support for list elements in the [Paste from Word](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/pastefromword) plugin.
* [#5410](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5410): Added the ability to indicate the language of styles in the [Styles Combo](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/stylescombo) plugin via the [`config.styleSet`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-stylesSet) configuration option.
* [#5510](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5510): Added notification system to the editor informing users that the editor version is up-to-date and secure. See [`config.versionCheck`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-versionCheck) configuration option to learn more.

Fixed Issues:

* [#5437](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5437): Fixed: Incorrect indication of selected items in combo boxes. The selected item was unmarked upon each opening of the combo box.
* [#5495](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5495): Fixed: Insufficient color ratio for links inside [Notifications](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/notification).

Other Changes:

* [#5412](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5412): Prevent using `document.domain` in Firefox in the [Preview](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/preview) plugin.

Note: CKEditor 4.22.1 has been released immediately after 4.22.0 to fix the README issues on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and contains no changes vs 4.22.0.

## CKEditor 4.21.0

**Security Updates:**

A cross-site scripting vulnerability has been discovered affecting [Iframe Dialog](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/iframe) and [Media Embed](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/embed) plugins.

This vulnerability might affect a small percentage of integrators that depend on dynamic editor initialization/destroy mechanism. See [GitHub advisory](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/security/advisories/GHSA-vh5c-xwqv-cv9g) for more details.

**Potential breaking changes**

In some rare cases, a security release may introduce a breaking change to your application. We have provided configuration options that will help you mitigate any potential issues with the upgrade:

* Starting from version 4.21, the [Iframe Dialog](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/iframe) plugin applies the `sandbox` attribute by default, which restricts JavaScript code execution in the iframe element. To change this behavior, configure the [`config.iframe_attributes`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-iframe_attributes) option.
* Starting from version 4.21, the [Media Embed](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/embed) plugin regenerates the entire content of the embed widget by default. To change this behavior, configure the [`config.embed_keepOriginalContent`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-embed_keepOriginalContent) option.

If you choose to change either of the above options, make sure to properly configure [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) to avoid any potential security issues that may arise from embedding iframe elements on your web page.

You can read more details in the relevant security advisory and [contact us](/ckeditor/ckeditor4/blob/master/security%40cksource.com) if you have more questions.

**An upgrade is highly recommended!**

New Features:

* [#4400](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/4400): Added the [`config.uploadImage_supportedTypes`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-uploadImage_supportedTypes) configuration option allowing to change the image formats accepted by the [Upload Image](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/uploadimage) plugin. Thanks to [SilverYoCha](https://github.com/SilverYoCha)!

Fixed Issues:

* [#5431](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5431): Fixed: No notification is shown when pasting or dropping unsupported image types into the editor.

* [#4829](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/4829): Fixed: Undo reversed entire table content instead of a single cell. Thanks to that fix, multiple changes in a table can be undone one by one.
* [#5396](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5396): Fixed: Event listeners for `popstate` and `hashchange` events on the `window`, added by the [Maximize](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/maximize) plugin, were not removed when destroying the editor instance.
* [#5414](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5414): Fixed: File and image uploaders based on the [Upload Widget plugin](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/uploadwidget) and [Easy Image plugin](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/easyimage)  didn't fire the [`change` event](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#event-change) upon finishing upload, resulting in passing incorrect data in form controls for integration frameworks, like [Reactive forms in Angular](https://angular.io/guide/reactive-forms).
* [#698](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/698): Fixed: An error was thrown after applying formatting to the widget with inline editable and switching to the source mode. Thanks to [Glen](https://github.com/glen-84)!

API changes:

* [#3540](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/3540): The [startup data](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_plugins_widget.html) passed to the widget's command is now used to also populate the widget's template.
* [#5352](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5352): Added the [`colorButton_contentsCss`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-colorButton_contentsCss) configuration option allowing to add custom CSS to the [Color Button](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/colorbutton) menu content. Thanks to [mihilion](https://github.com/mihilion)!

## CKEditor 4.20.1

Fixed Issues:

* [#5333](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5333): Fixed: The original name of the uploaded image is not preserved by the [Upload Image](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/uploadimage) plugin if the [Clipboard](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/clipboard) plugin has enabled image handling.
* [#2881](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/2881): Fixed: Changing table headers from "Both" to "First column" in the [Table](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/table) dialog does not change the first column cell correctly.
* [#2996](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/2996): Fixed: Table header "scope" attribute is incorrect for the "Headers: both" option in the [Table](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/table) dialog.
* [#4802](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/4802): Fixed: [Tableselection](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/tableselection) caret moves to the previous cell after tabbing into the next cell and then removing its content.
* [#5365](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5365): Fixed: The value of the [`config.baseFloatZIndex`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-baseFloatZIndex) config variable is incorrectly applied to parent dialog when the child dialog is closed resulting in the dialog overlay covering up the dialog. Thanks to [JenoDK](https://github.com/JenoDK)!
* [#5305](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5305): Fixed: Anchor name can invalidly include spaces.

## CKEditor 4.20

New Features:

* [#5084](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5084): Added the [`config.tabletools_scopedHeaders`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-tabletools_scopedHeaders) configuration option controlling the behaviour of table headers with and without the `[scope]` attribute.
* [#5219](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5219): Added the [`config.image2_defaultLockRatio`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-image2_defaultLockRatio) configuration option allowing to set the default value of the "Lock ratio" option in the [Enhanced Image](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/image2) dialog.
* [#2008](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor-dev/pull/2008): Extended the [Mentions](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/mentions) and [Emoji](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/emoji) plugins with a feature option that adds a space after an accepted autocompletion match. See:
  + [`configDefinition.followingSpace`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_plugins_mentions_configDefinition.html#property-followingSpace) option for the mentions plugin, and
  + [`config.emoji_followingSpace`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-emoji_followingSpace) option for the emoji plugin.
* [#5215](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5215): Added the [`config.coreStyles_toggleSubSup`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-coreStyles_toggleSubSup) configuration option which disallows setting the subscript and superscript on the same element simultaneously using UI buttons. This option is turned off by default.

Fixed Issues:

* [#4889](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/4889): Fixed: Incorrect position of the [Table Resize](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/tableresize) cursor after scrolling the editor horizontally.
* [#5319](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5319): Fixed: [Autolink](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/autolink) [`config.autolink_urlRegex`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-autolink_urlRegex) option produced invalid links when configured directly using the editor instance config. Thanks to [Aigars Zeiza](https://github.com/Zuzon)!
* [#4941](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/4941): Fixed: Some entities got wrongly encoded when using [`entities_processNumerical = true`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-entities_processNumerical) configuration option.
* [#4931](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/4931): Fixed: Selecting the whole editor content when there is only a list with an empty element at the end inside and deleting it did not delete all list items.

API changes:

* [#5122](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5122): Added the ability to provide a list of buttons as an array to the [`config.removeButtons`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-removeButtons) config variable.
* [#2008](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor-dev/pull/2008): Added [Autocomplete](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/autocomplete) [`followingSpace`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_plugins_autocomplete_configDefinition.html#property-followingSpace) option that finishes an accepted match with a space.

## CKEditor 4.19.1

Fixed Issues:

* [#5125](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5125): Fixed: Deleting a widget with disabled [autoParagraph](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-autoParagraph) by the keyboard `backspace` key removes the editor editable area and crashes the editor.
* [#5135](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5135): Fixed: The [`checkbox.setValue`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_ui_dialog_checkbox.html#method-setValue) and [`radio.setValue`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_ui_dialog_radio.html#method-setValue) methods are not chainable as stated in the documentation. Thanks to [Jordan Bradford](https://github.com/LordPachelbel)!
* [#5085](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5085): Fixed: The [Language](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/language) plugin removes the element marking the text in foreign language if said element does not have an information about the text direction.
* [#4284](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/4284): Fixed: [Tableselection](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/tableselection) Merging cells with a rowspan throws an unexpected error and does not create an undo step.
* [#5184](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5184): Fixed: The [Editor Placeholder](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/wysiwygarea) plugin degrades typing performance.
* [#5158](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5158): Fixed: [`CKEDITOR.tools#convertToPx()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_tools.html#method-convertToPx) gives invalid results if the helper calculator element was deleted from the DOM.
* [#5234](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5234): Fixed: [Easy Image](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/easyimage) doesn't allow to upload images files using toolbar button.
* [#438](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/438): Fixed: It is impossible to navigate to the [elementspath](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/elementspath) from the [toolbar](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/toolbar) by keyboard and vice versa.
* [#4449](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/4449): Fixed: [`dialog.validate#functions`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_dialog_validate.html#method-functions) incorrectly composes functions that return an optional error message, like e.g. [`dialog.validate.number`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_dialog_validate.html#method-number) due to unnecessary return type coercion.
* [#4473](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/4473): Fixed: The [dialog.validate](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_dialog_validate.html) method does not accept parameter value. The issue originated in [dialog.validate.functions](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_dialog_validate.html#method-functions) method that did not properly propagate parameter value to validator. Affected validators:
  + [`functions`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_dialog_validate.html#method-functions)
  + [`equals`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_dialog_validate.html#method-equals)
  + [`notEqual`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_dialog_validate.html#method-notEqual)
  + [`cssLength`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_dialog_validate.html#method-cssLength)
  + [`htmlLength`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_dialog_validate.html#method-htmlLength)
  + [`inlineStyle`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_dialog_validate.html#method-inlineStyle)
* [#5147](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5147): Fixed: The [Accessibility Help](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/a11yhelp) dialog does not contain info about focus being moved back to the editing area upon leaving dialogs.
* [#5144](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/5144): Fixed: [Menu buttons](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/menubutton) and [panel buttons](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/panelbutton) incorrectly indicate the open status of their associated pop-up menus in the browser's accessibility tree.

## CKEditor 4.9.2

**Security Updates:**

* Fixed XSS vulnerability in the [Enhanced Image](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/image2) (`image2`) plugin reported by [Kyaw Min Thein](https://twitter.com/kyawminthein99).

  Issue summary: It was possible to execute XSS inside CKEditor using the `<img>` tag and specially crafted HTML. Please note that the default presets (Basic/Standard/Full) do not include this plugin, so you are only at risk if you made a custom build and enabled this plugin.

We would like to thank the [Drupal security team](https://www.drupal.org/drupal-security-team) for bringing this matter to our attention and coordinating the fix and release process!

The issue was originally reported as a security issue by [Sriramk21](https://twitter.com/sriramk21) from Pegasystems and was later downgraded by the security team into a normal issue due to the requirement of having ACF turned off. Disabling [Advanced Content Filter](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_advanced_content_filter.html) is against [security best practices](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_best_practices.html#security), so the problem described above has not been considered a security issue as such.

## CKEditor 4.5 Beta

New Features:

* Clipboard (copy&paste, drag&drop) and file uploading features and improvements ([#11437](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11437)).

  + Major features:

    - Support for dropping and pasting files into the editor was introduced. Through a set of new facades for native APIs it is now possible to easily intercept and process inserted files.
    - [File upload tools](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.fileTools.html) were introduced in order to simplify controlling the loading, uploading and handling server response, properly handle [new upload configuration](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-uploadUrl) options, etc.
    - [Upload Image](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/uploadimage) widget was introduced to upload dropped images. A base class for the [upload widget](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.fileTools.uploadWidgetDefinition.html) was exposed, too, to make it simple to create new types of upload widgets which can handle any type of dropped file, show the upload progress and update the content when the process is done. It also handles editing and undo/redo operations when a file is being uploaded and integrates with the [notification aggregator](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.plugins.notificationAggregator.html) to show progress and success or error.
    - All drag and drop operations were integrated with the editor. All dropped content is passed through the [`editor#paste`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#event-paste) event and a set of new editor events was introduced — [`dragstart`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#event-dragstart), [`drop`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#event-drop), [`dragend`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#event-dragend).
    - The [Data Transfer](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.plugins.clipboard.dataTransfer.html) facade was introduced to unify access to data in various types and files. [Data Transfer](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.plugins.clipboard.dataTransfer.html) is now always available in the [`editor#paste`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#event-paste) event.
    - Switched from the pastebin to using the native clipboard access whenever possible. This solved many issues related to pastebin such as unnecessary scrolling or data loss. Additionally, on copy and cut from the editor the clipboard data is set. Therefore, on paste the editor has access to clean data, undisturbed by the browsers.
    - Drag and drop of inline and block widgets was integrated with the standard clipboard APIs. By listening to drag events you will thus be notified about widgets, too. This opens a possibility to filter pasted and dropped widgets.
    - The [`editor#paste`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#event-paste) event can have the `range` parameter so it is possible to change the paste position in the listener or paste in the not selectable position. Also the [`editor.insertHtml()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#method-insertHtml) method now accepts `range` as an additional parameter.
    - [#11621](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11621): A configurable [paste filter](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-pasteFilter) was introduced. The filter is by default turned to `'semantic-content'` on Webkit and Blink for all pasted content coming from external sources because of the low quality of HTML that these engines put into the clipboard. Internal and cross-editor paste is safe due to the change explained in the previous point.
  + Other changes and related fixes:

    - [#12095](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12095): On drag and copy of widgets [the same method](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#method-getSelectedHtml) is used to get selected HTML as in the normal case. Thanks to that styles applied to inline widgets are not lost.
    - [#11219](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11219): Fixed: Dragging a [captioned image](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/image2) does not fire the [`editor#paste`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#event-paste) event.
    - [#9554](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/9554): [Webkit Mac] Fixed: Editor scrolls on paste.
    - [#9898](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/9898): [Webkit&Divarea] Fixed: Pasting causes undesirable scrolling.
    - [#11993](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11993): [Chrome] Fixed: Pasting content scrolls the document.
    - [#12613](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12613): Show the user that they can not drop on editor UI (toolbar, bottom bar).
    - [#12851](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12851): [Blink/Webkit] Fixed: Formatting disappears when pasting content into cells.
    - [#12914](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12914): Fixed: Copy/Paste of table broken in `div`-based editor.
  + Browser support.
    Browser support for related features varies significantly (see <http://caniuse.com/clipboard>).

    - File APIs needed to operate and file upload is not supported in Internet Explorer 9 and below.
    - Only Chrome and Safari on Mac OS support setting custom data items in the clipboard, so currently it is possible to recognize the origin of the copied content in these browsers only. All drag and drop operations can be identified thanks to the new Data Transfer facade.
    - No Internet Explorer browser supports the standard clipboard API which results in small glitches like where only plain text can be dropped from outside the editor. Thanks to the new Data Transfer facade, internal and cross-editor drag and drop supports the full range of data.
    - Direct access to clipboard could only be implemented in Chrome, Safari on Mac OS, Opera and Firefox. In other browsers the pastebin must still be used.
* [#12875](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12875): Samples and toolbar configuration tools.

  + The old set of samples shipped with every CKEditor package was replaced with a shiny new single-page sample. This change concluded a long term plan which started from introducing the [CKEditor SDK](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/examples/index.html) and [CKEditor Features Overview](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/features.html) section in the documentation which essentially redefined the old samples.
  + Toolbar configurators with live previews were introduced. They will be shipped with every CKEditor package and are meant to help in configuring toolbar layouts.
* [#10925](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/10925): The [Media Embed](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/embed) and [Semantic Media Embed](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/embedsemantic) plugins were introduced. Read more about the new features in the [Embedding Content](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_media_embed.html) article.
* [#10931](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/10931): Added support for nesting widgets. It is now possible to insert one widget into another widget's nested editable. Note that unless nested editable's [allowed content](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_plugins_widget_nestedEditable_definition.html#property-allowedContent) is defined precisely, starting from CKEditor 4.5 some widget buttons may become enabled. This feature is not supported in IE8. Included issues:

  + [#12018](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12018): Fixed and reviewed: Nested widgets garbage collection.
  + [#12024](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12024): [Firefox] Fixed: Outline is extended to the left by unpositioned drag handlers.
  + [#12006](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12006): Fixed: Drag and drop of nested block widgets.
  + [#12008](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12008): Fixed various cases of inserting a single non-editable element using the [`editor.insertHtml()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#method-insertHtml) method. Fixes pasting a widget with a nested editable inside another widget's nested editable.
* Notification system:

  + [#11580](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11580): Introduced the [notification system](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.plugins.notification.html).
  + [#12810](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12810): Introduced a [notification aggregator](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.plugins.notificationAggregator.html) for the [notification system](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.plugins.notification.html) which simplifies displaying progress of many concurrent tasks.
* [#11636](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11636): Introduced new, UX-focused, methods for getting selected HTML and deleting it — [`editor.getSelectedHtml()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#method-getSelectedHtml) and [`editor.extractSelectedHtml()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#method-extractSelectedHtml).
* [#12416](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12416): Added the [`widget.definition.upcastPriority`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_plugins_widget_definition.html#property-upcastPriority) property which gives more control over widget upcasting order to the widget author.
* [#12036](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12036): Initialize the editor in [read-only](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#property-readOnly) mode when the `<textarea>` element has a `readonly` attribute.
* [#11905](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11905): The [`resize` event](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#event-resize) passes the current dimensions in its data.
* [#12126](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12126): Introduced [`config.image_prefillDimensions`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-image_prefillDimensions) and [`config.image2_prefillDimensions`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-image2_prefillDimensions) to make pre-filling `width` and `height` configurable for the [Enhanced Image](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/image2).
* [#12746](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12746): Added a new configuration option to hide the [Enhanced Image](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/image2) resizer.
* [#12150](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12150): Exposed the [`getNestedEditable()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_plugins_widget.html#static-method-getNestedEditable) and `is*` [widget helper](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.plugins.widget.html) functions (see the static methods).
* [#12448](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12448): Introduced the [`editable.insertHtmlIntoRange`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editable.html#method-insertHtmlIntoRange) method.
* [#12143](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12143): Added the [`config.floatSpacePreferRight`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-floatSpacePreferRight) configuration option that switches the alignment of the floating toolbar. Thanks to [InvisibleBacon](http://github.com/InvisibleBacon)!
* [#10986](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/10986): Added support for changing dialog input and textarea text directions by using the *Shift+Alt+Home/End* keystrokes. The direction is stored in the value of the input by prepending the [`\u202A`](http://unicode.org/cldr/utility/character.jsp?a=202A) or [`\u202B`](http://unicode.org/cldr/utility/character.jsp?a=202B) marker to it. Read more in the [documentation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_dialog_definition_textInput.html#property-bidi). Thanks to [edithkk](https://github.com/edithkk)!
* [#12770](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12770): Added support for passing [widget](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.plugins.widget.html)'s startup data as a widget command's argument. Thanks to [Rebrov Boris](https://github.com/zipp3r) and [Tieme van Veen](https://github.com/tiemevanveen)!
* [#11583](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11583): Added support for the HTML5 `required` attribute in various form elements. Thanks to [Steven Busse](https://github.com/sbusse)!

Changes:

* [#12858](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12858): Basic [Spartan](http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2015/03/30/introducing-project-spartan-the-new-browser-built-for-windows-10/) browser compatibility. Full compatibility will be introduced later, because at the moment Spartan is still too unstable to be used for tests and we see many changes from version to version.
* [#12948](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12948): The [`config.mathJaxLibrary`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-mathJaxLib) option does not default to the MathJax CDN any more. It needs to be configured to enable the [Mathematical Formulas](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/mathjax) plugin now.
* [#13069](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/13069): Fixed inconsistencies between [`editable.insertHtml()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editable.html#method-insertElement) and [`editable.insertElement()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editable.html#method-insertElement) when the `range` parameter is used. Now, the `editor.insertElement()` method works on a higher level, which means that it saves undo snapshots and sets the selection after insertion. Use the [`editable.insertElementIntoRange()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editable.html#method-insertElementIntoRange) method directly for the pre 4.5 behavior of `editable.insertElement()`.
* [#12870](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12870): Use [`editor.showNotification()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#method-showNotification) instead of `alert()` directly whenever possible. When the [Notification plugin](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/notification) is loaded, the notification system is used automatically. Otherwise, the native `alert()` is displayed.
* [#8024](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/8024): Swapped behavior of the Split Cell Vertically and Horizontally features of the [Table Tools](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/tabletools) plugin to be more intuitive. Thanks to [kevinisagit](https://github.com/kevinisagit)!
* [#10903](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/10903): Performance improvements for the [`dom.element.addClass()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_dom_element.html#method-addClass), [`dom.element.removeClass()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_dom_element.html#method-removeClass) and [`dom.element.hasClass()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_dom_element.html#method-hasClass) methods. Note: The previous implementation allowed passing multiple classes to `addClass()` although it was only a side effect of that implementation. The new implementation does not allow this.
* [#11856](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11856): The jQuery adapter throws a meaningful error if CKEditor or jQuery are not loaded.

Fixed issues:

* [#11586](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11586): Fixed: [`range.cloneContents()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_dom_range.html#method-cloneContents) should not change the DOM in order not to affect selection.
* [#12148](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12148): Fixed: [`dom.element.getChild()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_dom_element.html#method-getChild) should not modify a passed array.
* [#12503](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12503): [Blink/Webkit] Fixed: Incorrect result of Select All and *Backspace* or *Delete*.
* [#13001](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/13001): [Firefox] Fixed: The `<br />` filler is placed in the wrong position by the [`range.fixBlock()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_dom_range.html#method-fixBlock) method due to quirky Firefox behavior.
* [#13101](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/13101): [IE8] Fixed: Colons are prepended to HTML5 element names when cloning them.

## CKEditor 4.4.8

**Security Updates:**

* Fixed XSS vulnerability in the HTML parser reported by [Dheeraj Joshi](https://twitter.com/dheerajhere) and [Prem Kumar](https://twitter.com/iAmPr3m).

  Issue summary: It was possible to execute XSS inside CKEditor after persuading the victim to: (i) switch CKEditor to source mode, then (ii) paste a specially crafted HTML code, prepared by the attacker, into the opened CKEditor source area, and (iii) switch back to WYSIWYG mode.

Thanks to [Florian Ludwig](https://github.com/FlorianLudwig)!
* [#13232](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/13232): [Safari] Fixed: The [`element.appendText()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_dom_element.html#method-appendText) method does not work properly for empty elements.

## CKEditor 4.4.6

**Security Updates:**

* Fixed XSS vulnerability in the HTML parser reported by [Maco Cortes](https://www.facebook.com/Maaacoooo).

  Issue summary: It was possible to execute XSS inside CKEditor after persuading the victim to: (i) switch CKEditor to source mode, then (ii) paste a specially crafted HTML code, prepared by the attacker, into the opened CKEditor source area, and (iii) switch back to WYSIWYG mode.

**An upgrade is highly recommended!**

New Features:

* [#12501](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12501): Allowed dashes in element names in the [string format of allowed content rules](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_allowed_content_rules.html#string-format).

* [#12630](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/12630): [Chrome] Fixed: Selection is placed outside the paragraph when the [New Page](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/newpage) button is clicked. This patch significantly simplified the way how the initial selection (a selection after the content of the editable is overwritten) is being fixed. That might have fixed many related scenarios in all browsers.
* [#11647](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11647): Fixed: The [`editor.blur`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#event-blur) event is not fired on first blur after initializing the inline editor on an already focused element.

## CKEditor 4.4

**Important Notes:**

* Marked the [`editor.beforePaste`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#event-beforePaste) event as deprecated.
* The default class of captioned images has changed to `image` (was: `caption`). Please note that once edited in CKEditor 4.4+, all existing images of the `caption` class (`<figure class="caption">`) will be [filtered out](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_advanced_content_filter.html) unless the [`config.image2_captionedClass`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-image2_captionedClass) option is set to `caption`. For backward compatibility (i.e. when upgrading), it is highly recommended to use this setting, which also helps prevent CSS conflicts, etc. This does not apply to new CKEditor integrations.
* Widgets without defined buttons are no longer registered automatically to the [Advanced Content Filter](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_advanced_content_filter.html). Before CKEditor 4.4 widgets were registered to the ACF which was an incorrect behavior ([#11567](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11567)). This change should not have any impact on standard scenarios, but if your button does not execute the widget command, you need to set [`allowedContent`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_feature.html#property-allowedContent) and [`requiredContent`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_feature.html#property-requiredContent) properties for it manually, because the editor will not be able to find them.
* The [Show Borders](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/showborders) plugin was added to the Standard installation package in order to ensure that unstyled tables are still visible for the user ([#11665](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11665)).
* Since CKEditor 4.4 the editor instance should be passed to [`CKEDITOR.style`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.style.html) methods to ensure full compatibility with other features (e.g. applying styles to widgets requires that). We ensured backward compatibility though, so the [`CKEDITOR.style`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.style.html) will work even when the editor instance is not provided.

New Features:

* [#11297](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/11297): Styles can now be applied to widgets. The definition of a style which can be applied to a specific widget must contain two additional properties — `type` and `widget`. Read more in the [Widget Styles](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_styles.html#widget-styles) section of the "Styles Drop-down" guide. Note that by default, widgets support only classes and no other attributes or styles. Related changes and features:
  + Introduced the [`CKEDITOR.style.addCustomHandler()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_style.html#static-method-addCustomHandler) method for registering custom style handlers.
  + The [`CKEDITOR.style.apply()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_style.html#method-apply) and [`CKEDITOR.style.remove()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_style.html#method-remove) methods are now called with an editor instance instead of the document so they can be reused by the [`CKEDITOR.editor.applyStyle()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#method-applyStyle) and [`CKEDITOR.editor.removeStyle()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#method-removeStyle) methods. Backward compatibility was preserved, but from CKEditor 4.4 it is highly recommended to pass an editor instead of a document to these methods.
  + Many new methods and properties were introduced in the [Widget API](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.plugins.widget.html) to make the handling of styles by widgets fully customizable. See: [`widget.definition.styleableElements`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_plugins_widget_definition.html#property-styleableElements), [`widget.definition.styleToAllowedContentRule`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_plugins_widget_definition.html#property-styleToAllowedContentRules), [`widget.addClass()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_plugins_widget.html#method-addClass), [`widget.removeClass()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_plugins_widget.html#method-removeClass), [`widget.getClasses()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_plugins_widget.html#method-getClasses), [`widget.hasClass()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_plugins_widget.html#method-hasClass), [`widget.applyStyle()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_plugins_widget.html#method-applyStyle), [`widget.removeStyle()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_plugins_widget.html#method-removeStyle), [`widget.checkStyleActive()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_plugins_widget.html#method-checkStyleActive).

## CKEditor 4.3 Beta

New Features:

* [#9764](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/9764): Widget System.
  + [Widget plugin](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/widget) introducing the [Widget API](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.plugins.widget.html).
  + New [`editor.enterMode`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#property-enterMode) and [`editor.shiftEnterMode`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#property-shiftEnterMode) properties – normalized versions of [`config.enterMode`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-enterMode) and [`config.shiftEnterMode`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-shiftEnterMode).
  + Dynamic editor settings. Starting from CKEditor 4.3 Beta, *Enter* mode values and [content filter](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_advanced_content_filter.html) instances may be changed dynamically (for example when the caret was placed in an element in which editor features should be adjusted). When you are implementing a new editor feature, you should base its behavior on [dynamic](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#property-activeEnterMode) or [static](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#property-enterMode) *Enter* mode values depending on whether this feature works in selection context or globally on editor content.
    - Dynamic *Enter* mode values – [`editor.setActiveEnterMode()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#method-setActiveEnterMode) method, [`editor.activeEnterModeChange`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#event-activeEnterModeChange) event, and two properties: [`editor.activeEnterMode`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#property-activeEnterMode) and [`editor.activeShiftEnterMode`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#property-activeShiftEnterMode).
    - Dynamic content filter instances – [`editor.setActiveFilter()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#method-setActiveFilter) method, [`editor.activeFilterChange`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#event-activeFilterChange) event, and [`editor.activeFilter`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#property-activeFilter) property.
  + "Fake" selection was introduced. It makes it possible to virtually select any element when the real selection remains hidden. See the [`selection.fake()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_dom_selection.html#method-fake) method.
  + Default [`htmlParser.filter`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.htmlParser.filter.html) rules are not applied to non-editable elements (elements with `contenteditable` attribute set to `false` and their descendants) anymore. To add a rule which will be applied to all elements you need to pass an additional argument to the [`filter.addRules()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_htmlParser_filter.html#method-addRules) method.
  + Dozens of new methods were introduced – most interesting ones:
    - [`document.find()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_dom_document.html#method-find),
    - [`document.findOne()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_dom_document.html#method-findOne),
    - [`editable.insertElementIntoRange()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editable.html#method-insertElementIntoRange),
    - [`range.moveToClosestEditablePosition()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_dom_range.html#method-moveToClosestEditablePosition),
    - New methods for [`htmlParser.node`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.htmlParser.node.html) and [`htmlParser.element`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.htmlParser.element.html).
* [#10659](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/10659): New [Enhanced Image](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/image2) plugin that introduces a widget with integrated image captions, an option to center images, and dynamic "click and drag" resizing.
* [#10664](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/10664): New [Mathematical Formulas](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/mathjax) plugin that introduces the MathJax widget.
* [#7987](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/7987): New [Language](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/language) plugin that implements Language toolbar button to support [WCAG 3.1.2 Language of Parts](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/meaning-other-lang-id.html).
* [#10708](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/10708): New [smileys](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/smiley).

* [#10951](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/10951): Reviewed and optimized focus handling on panels (combo, menu buttons, color buttons, and context menu) to enhance accessibility.

**Important Notes:**

* Dropped compatibility support for Internet Explorer 7 and Firefox 3.6.
* Both the Basic and the Standard distribution packages will not contain the new [Indent Block](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/indentblock) plugin. Because of this the [Advanced Content Filter](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_advanced_content_filter.html) might remove block indentations from existing contents. If you want to prevent this, either [add an appropriate ACF rule to your filter](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_allowed_content_rules.html) or create a custom build based on the Basic/Standard package and add the Indent Block plugin in [CKBuilder](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/builder).

## CKEditor 4.1 RC

New Features:

* [#9829](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/9829): Advanced Content Filter - data and features activation based on editor configuration.

  Brand new data filtering system that works in 2 modes:

  + Based on loaded features (toolbar items, plugins) - the data will be filtered according to what the editor in its
    current configuration can handle.
  + Based on [`config.allowedContent`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-allowedContent) rules - the data
    will be filtered and the editor features (toolbar items, commands, keystrokes) will be enabled if they are allowed.

  See the `datafiltering.html` sample, [guides](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_advanced_content_filter.html) and [`CKEDITOR.filter` API documentation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.filter.html).
* [#9387](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/9387): Reintroduced [Shared Spaces](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/sharedspace) - the ability to display toolbar and bottom editor space in selected locations and to share them by different editor instances.

* [#9981](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/9981): Added ability to filter [`htmlParser.fragment`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.htmlParser.fragment.html), [`htmlParser.element`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.htmlParser.element.html) etc. by many [`htmlParser.filter`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.htmlParser.filter.html)s before writing structure to an HTML string.
* Included in [#10103](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/10103):

  + Introduced the [`editor.status`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_editor.html#property-status) property to make it easier to check the current status of the editor.
  + Default [`command`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.command.html) state is now [`CKEDITOR.TRISTATE_DISABLE`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.html#property-TRISTATE_DISABLED). It will be activated on [`editor.instanceReady`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR.html#event-instanceReady) or immediately after being added if the editor is already initialized.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2019

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2019

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 319 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2019 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2559985.1).

 **Please note that since the release of the April 2019 Critical Patch Update, Oracle has released two Security Alerts for Oracle WebLogic Server:  [CVE-2019-2725 (April 29, 2019)](/security-alerts/alert-cve-2019-2725.html) and  [CVE-2019-2729 (June 18, 2019)](/security-alerts/alert-cve-2019-2729.html). WebLogic Server customers are strongly advised to apply the fixes contained in this Critical Patch Update, which provides the fixes for the previously-released Alerts as well as additional fixes.**

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <http://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2019verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](//www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Oracle Enterprise Manager Products Suite Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 12 new security fixes for the Oracle Enterprise Manager Products Suite.  10 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  None of these fixes are applicable to client-only installations, i.e., installations that do not have the Oracle Enterprise Manager Products Suite installed. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2019verbose.html#EM).

Oracle Enterprise Manager products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle Enterprise Manager products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security fixes are not listed in the Oracle Enterprise Manager risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle Enterprise Manager products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the July 2019 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Enterprise Manager. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update July 2019 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2534806.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2534806.1).

#### Notes:

1. Outside In Technology is a suite of software development kits (SDKs). The protocol and CVSS score depend on the software that uses the Outside In Technology code. The CVSS score assumes that the software passes data received over a network directly to Outside In Technology code, but if data is not received over a network the CVSS score may be lower.

### Oracle Java SE Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 10 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE.  9 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2019verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application (in Java SE 8) has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.
