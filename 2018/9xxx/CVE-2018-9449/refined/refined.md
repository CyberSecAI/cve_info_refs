Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9449:

**CVE-2018-9449**

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper size checks for Protocol Data Units (PDUs) within the `process_service_search_attr_rsp` function. This function is part of the Bluetooth stack.
* **Weakness/Vulnerability:** The absence of size validation allows an attacker to potentially send maliciously crafted PDUs with sizes exceeding the buffer limits. This can lead to a buffer overflow.
* **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition or, potentially, remote code execution (RCE).
* **Attack Vector:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted, oversized PDU packets over Bluetooth to a vulnerable device.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * The attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range of the target device.
    * They must possess the ability to send custom Bluetooth packets, which would typically require some specialized tools or software.

**Additional Details:**
* The fix for this issue is located in the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) commit [27b90f4f6fe3811335e9bb4fac4656bc1df49204](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/bt/%2B/27b90f4f6fe3811335e9bb4fac4656bc1df49204). This commit adds the necessary PDU size checks to prevent the buffer overflow.
* The vulnerability is classified as "Moderate" severity.
* Affected AOSP versions include 6.0, 6.0.1, 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, and 8.1.
