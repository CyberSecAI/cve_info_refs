Based on the provided content, here's the analysis for CVE-2018-9864:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the "WP Live Chat Support" WordPress plugin. Specifically, it involves multiple issues:
    *   **Issue 1:**  The `bleeper_strip_tags` function in the external javascript file `bleeper-agent-dev.js` only filters closed HTML tags, which could be bypassed using unclosed tags. The `chatInfoArea-Name` variable was also not escaped. This allows for arbitrary Javascript injection in the admin panel by using the `Name` text field.
    *   **Issue 2:** Lack of sanitization of `$result->id` within the `wp-live-chat-support.php` file, which allows for arbitrary javascript injection in the admin panel on the `wplivechat-menu-history` page.
    *   **Issue 3:** The plugin allows the upload of SVG files, which can contain embedded JavaScript. The `bleeper_file_suffix_check` array included the `.svg` extension, allowing attackers to attach SVG files containing malicious scripts in the chat feature.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities exist in multiple locations of the admin panel.
    *   Inadequate input sanitization and output escaping mechanisms.
    *   Insecure file upload handling by not properly validating SVG file content.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the admin panel. This code could be used to:
    *   Steal administrator session cookies, leading to account takeover.
    *   Redirect administrators to malicious websites.
    *   Modify plugin settings or other WordPress content.
    *   Perform any other action an administrator is authorized to do.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Issue 1:** By submitting malicious input in the `Name` field via the plugin's user interface.
    *   **Issue 2:** By sending a chat message with a specially crafted ID.
    *    **Issue 3:** By attaching an SVG file with embedded malicious JavaScript.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to inject the Javascript code via the name field or the SVG file.
    *   For the `$result->id` vulnerability, an attacker can trigger the javascript injection by initiating a chat.

**Additional Information:**

*   The plugin developers were informed of the vulnerabilities and have addressed them through remote updates of the external javascript file `bleeper-agent-dev.js` and by updating the plugin to version 8.0.06.
*   The vulnerability related to SVG uploads was only present in the Pro version of the plugin.
*   The provided text mentions a security fix in version 9.1.0 and further security fixes in version 9.2.1. It also mentions the fix of XSS vulnerabilities in version 8.2.0.
