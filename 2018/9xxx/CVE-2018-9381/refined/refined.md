Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9381:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is related to the `gats_process_read_by_type_req` function within the Bluetooth subsystem.
- A local variable within this function is not being initialized properly.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure (ID):**  The lack of initialization of a local variable can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. The uninitialized memory might contain data from previous operations, which could potentially be leaked to an attacker with the ability to trigger the vulnerable code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information by exploiting the uninitialized variable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Triggering the vulnerable `gats_process_read_by_type_req` function within the Bluetooth subsystem.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the Bluetooth subsystem to trigger the vulnerable code path, which implies local access to the device.
- The attacker would need to send a specially crafted Bluetooth request to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The commit message "Initialize local variable in gats_process_read_by_type_req" further confirms the root cause.
- The fix addresses the issue by ensuring that the local variable is properly initialized before use.
- The affected version is Android 8.1
- The vulnerability is categorized as "Moderate" severity.
-  The fix was included in the June 2018 Pixel/Nexus Security Bulletin.
