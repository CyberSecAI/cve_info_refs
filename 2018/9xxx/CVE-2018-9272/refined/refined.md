{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Multiple dissectors and other modules could leak memory.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Memory leaks in TN3270 dissector",
    "Memory leaks in ISUP dissector",
    "Memory leaks in LAPD dissector",
    "Memory leaks in SMB2 dissector",
    "Memory leaks in GIOP dissector",
    "Memory leaks in ASN.1 dissector",
    "Memory leaks in MIME multipart dissector",
    "Memory leaks in H.223 dissector",
    "Memory leaks in PCP dissector"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "It may be possible to make Wireshark crash.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Injecting a malformed packet onto the wire",
    "Convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to inject malformed packets or have the victim open a malformed packet trace file."
