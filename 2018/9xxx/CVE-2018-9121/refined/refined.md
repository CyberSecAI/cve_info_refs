The provided content discusses multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the Crea8Social Social Network Script. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information related to CVE-2018-9121 (as it's listed alongside the other CVEs):

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and filtering of user-supplied data within the Crea8Social Social Network Script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored XSS:**
    - Vulnerable in post comments, user profiles, and posts. This means malicious scripts can be stored in the database and executed when other users view the affected content.
- **Reflected XSS:**
    - Vulnerable in the search feature. Malicious scripts embedded in the search query are executed in the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A regular user can create a malicious account and potentially hijack an administrator's account to gain full control of the platform.
- **Client-Side JS Execution:** Malicious JS code can be executed in the browser of other users who interact with the attacker's content or profile, enabling cookie theft or private information theft.
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can steal session cookies and private information from other users through the execution of malicious client-side JavaScript.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious input through user-generated content, including:
    - Post comments.
    - User profiles.
    - Regular posts.
    - Search queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Any user (including a regular user with a bogus account) can exploit these vulnerabilities. They do not need administrative access to launch the attacks.

**Payload Examples:**
- `<SCRIPT>alert(“XSS-Here”);//<</SCRIPT>`
- Search query example: `/search?term=%22%20onmousemove=%22alert(document.domain)%22`

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerabilities were identified during a "quick trial security assessment" and not a full penetration test.
- The vendor of Crea8Social was notified but did not respond within the 90-day disclosure deadline, prompting the public disclosure of the vulnerabilities.
- The content provides more details than the standard CVE description, including specific vulnerable modules, attack vectors, and proof-of-concept videos.
