Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9586:

**Summary:**

This CVE relates to an elevation of privilege vulnerability within the ManagedProvisioning application in Android. The vulnerability allows bypassing user interaction requirements, leading to potential unauthorized access.

**Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the ManagedProvisioning application incorrectly handling certain scenarios during device provisioning, specifically related to package verification. The code was temporarily disabling the package verifier during device owner (DO) provisioning which is no longer needed.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Incorrect Handling of Package Verification:** During DO provisioning, the package verifier was temporarily disabled.
    *   **Bypass of User Interaction:** This incorrect handling could allow a malicious application or process to bypass user interaction requirements normally imposed by Android's permission model.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
   *   **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** A successful exploit could allow a malicious application or process to gain elevated privileges, potentially allowing it to perform actions it normally wouldn't be authorized to do.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Local Exploitation:** A malicious application on the device could exploit this vulnerability, but remote exploitation via a specially crafted file may be possible depending on how provisioning is initiated.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Local Application:** The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the device or find a way to trigger the vulnerability using a specially crafted file during the device provisioning process.

**Technical Details (from the provided commit messages):**

*   The fix removes code that temporarily disabled the package verifier during Device Owner (DO) provisioning.
*   The change was made because the user dialog box that previously required this workaround no longer appears when package verification is active.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is classified as "High" severity, which means that exploitation would likely have a significant impact on the security of the device.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in AOSP versions 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, 8.1, and 9.
