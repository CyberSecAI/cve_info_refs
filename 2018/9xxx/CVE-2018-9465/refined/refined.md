```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `proc->files` cleanup is initiated by `binder_vma_close`. A reference on `binder_proc` is not sufficient to prevent the `files_struct` from being released while the `binder_proc` still has a reference. This can lead to an attempt to dereference the stale pointer obtained from `proc->files` prior to the `proc->files` cleanup.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use-after-free vulnerability due to incorrect management of the `files_struct` associated with the `binder_proc`.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attempt to dereference a stale pointer obtained from `proc->files`, potentially leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "A local attacker can trigger the `binder_vma_close` leading to a race condition where `files_struct` is freed while a reference to it still exists in `binder_proc`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local access to the device is required to trigger the vulnerable code path."
