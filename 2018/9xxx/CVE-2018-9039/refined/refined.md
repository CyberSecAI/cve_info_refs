Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-9039:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control when scoping variables to deployment targets within Octopus Deploy. Users with variable edit permissions could view and scope variables to deployment targets beyond what their team's environment permissions should allow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The system failed to enforce environment-based scoping for deployment targets when editing variables.
- **Information Disclosure:** Users could view deployment targets they should not have access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Violation:** An attacker could potentially gain knowledge of infrastructure details and configurations from environments they are not authorized to access by viewing other deployment targets and potentially related sensitive variables. This information could later be used for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is **Network**, requiring the attacker to have network access to the Octopus Deploy instance.
- **Authenticated User:** Requires an attacker to have valid user credentials with edit permissions for Project/Library variable sets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user within Octopus Deploy.
- They require the specific permission to edit/view Project/Library variable sets.
- They do not need user interaction or high privileges.
- The attacker's team needs to have limited environment access to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Octopus Deploy versions 2.0 and later, before version 2018.3.7.
- The issue was tracked as issue #4407 in the OctopusDeploy GitHub repository.
- The fix was released in Octopus Deploy version 2018.3.7.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 6.5 (Moderate).
