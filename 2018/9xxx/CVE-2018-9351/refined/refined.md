Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9351:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an issue within the `libavc` library, specifically related to handling odd resolutions. The commit message "Encode: Return error for odd resolution" suggests a failure to properly handle such resolutions which could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect handling of odd resolutions within the video decoding process. This leads to a potential vulnerability when processing specially crafted video content, or potentially when video parameters do not comply with normal expectations.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The provided information explicitly states that the vulnerability can lead to a DoS. This likely means that a specially crafted video stream can cause a crash, or halt the decoding process, making the system unresponsive or the application processing the media to be terminated.
- The severity is noted as High for DoS.

**Attack vectors:**
- Processing of malicious or malformed video content.
- The attack vector is through a media framework that uses libavc.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide or induce the processing of a specially crafted video stream with odd resolution that triggers the vulnerability.
- No special privileges needed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix is related to ensuring that an error is returned when an odd resolution is encountered.
- This vulnerability was present in Android versions 6.0, 6.0.1 and affects 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0 and 8.1 before being patched.
- The provided commit ID  `27c639d897fb0f1f0acf6a58b5c013d65c63bd04` from the android git repository `platform/external/libavc` is the fix applied to address this vulnerability.
