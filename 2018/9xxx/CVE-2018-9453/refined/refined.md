**Verification:**

The commit message from android.googlesource.com clearly states "Add checks whether the AVCTP element data length is valid" and references bug number 78288378. This bug ID matches the one associated with CVE-2018-9453 in the Android Security Bulletin, confirming the relevance of this content.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper length validation for AVCTP (Audio/Video Control Transport Protocol) element data within the Bluetooth stack.
*   **Weakness:** The Bluetooth stack does not sufficiently validate the length of the data received in AVCTP packets.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can exploit this weakness by sending a crafted AVCTP packet with an invalid length. This could lead to information disclosure.
*  **Attack Vector:** A remote attacker can send a specially crafted bluetooth packet that exploits this issue.
*   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range and capable of sending manipulated AVCTP packets.
