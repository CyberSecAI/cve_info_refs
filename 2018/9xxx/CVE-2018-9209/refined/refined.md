Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-9209

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the `endpoint.php` file in the `php-traditional-server` project which allows unrestricted file uploads due to a lack of file type validation and authentication checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Unrestricted File Upload:** The `endpoint.php` script does not validate the file extensions being uploaded. Line 38 explicitly sets `$uploader->allowedExtensions = array();` which allows all file types.
   - **Missing Authentication:**  The code does not check if the user is authenticated before allowing file uploads, enabling unauthenticated users to upload arbitrary files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By uploading a malicious executable file (e.g., PHP script), an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
    - An attacker can upload a file containing malicious code via the vulnerable `endpoint.php` script. This is done by making a direct request to the endpoint using a HTTP POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker only needs to be able to access the server hosting the vulnerable `endpoint.php` script. No prior authentication or special privileges are needed. The attacker only requires knowledge of the endpoint URL.

**Additional Notes:**
   - The advisory notes that the original author of the vulnerable software deleted the repository.
