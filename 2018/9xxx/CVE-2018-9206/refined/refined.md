  "CVE-2018-9206": {
    "description": "The blueimp's jQuery File Upload widget, in versions up to and including 9.22.0, is vulnerable to arbitrary file upload. The vulnerability stems from the lack of validation on the server-side PHP code (`UploadHandler.php`), allowing attackers to upload any file type, including executable files with `.php` extensions. This, combined with a default configuration in Apache 2.3.9+ that may disable `.htaccess` support, leads to remote code execution.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Lack of file type validation in the PHP upload handler and potential misconfiguration of web servers.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Unrestricted file upload",
        "Lack of file type validation",
        "Reliance on .htaccess for security which may be disabled in certain configurations."
      ],
      "impact": "Remote code execution by uploading and executing arbitrary PHP files.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP POST request to the server-side PHP handler."
      ],
        "required_attacker_capabilities": "Ability to send HTTP requests to the target server. Basic understanding of HTTP and web application vulnerabilities."
      },
    "affected_components": [
       "blueimp's jQuery File Upload widget <= 9.22.0",
      "server-side PHP code (UploadHandler.php)",
        "Apache web server v2.3.9+ (specific configuration)."
    ],
     "additional_notes": [
      "The vulnerability has been actively exploited in the wild since at least 2015 and was publicly disclosed to the vendor in 2018.",
       "The author includes a `.htaccess` in `/server/php/files` directory that attempts to force the file as a download and change the file extension to `.html`. However, this depends on Apache's `mod_headers` module being enabled and AllowOverride being set to All, which may not be the default settings."
    ],
     "remediation": "Upgrade to a patched version of the software that includes file type validation. Ensure your server configuration prevents execution of uploaded files. Specifically, make sure `.htaccess` functionality is enabled, or configure the server to disable execution of PHP in the upload directory if `AllowOverride` is set to `None`."
