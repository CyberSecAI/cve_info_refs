  "CVE-2018-9454": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability is related to processing L2CAP packets within the Bluetooth subsystem. Specifically, it involves how the system handles BNEP (Bluetooth Network Encapsulation Protocol) data, particularly during Out-of-Band (OOB) access. The issue is triggered by sending a zero-length L2CAP packet, leading to a condition where the system attempts to process a BNEP extension control packet with a zero payload size or an incorrect size. The vulnerability is triggered in the processing of L2CAP packets when handling Out-of-Band (OOB) access in the Bluetooth subsystem.",
    "Root cause": "Improper handling of zero-length L2CAP packets and BNEP extension control packets with incorrect payload sizes, leading to incorrect buffer processing and out-of-bounds access during OOB access.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation for L2CAP packet length.",
      "Incorrect buffer processing logic for BNEP extension control packets with invalid payload sizes.",
      "Lack of proper checks before accessing buffer using length field."
    ],
    "Impact": "Information disclosure vulnerability that could allow a local attacker to read sensitive information through incorrect processing of L2CAP packets.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending a specially crafted zero-length L2CAP packet to trigger out of bound access.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local attacker that can send packets to the bluetooth interface."
