```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application lacks proper CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection, allowing an attacker to trick a logged-in administrator into performing unintended actions.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "CSRF vulnerability in two separate functionalities: adding a user and adding an administrator. The application does not validate the origin of the requests.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can add a new user and a new administrator account to the system without the administrator's consent, leading to unauthorized access and control of the system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts malicious HTML pages (one.html and two.html) containing JavaScript that automatically submits POST requests to the vulnerable application endpoints. The victim, when logged into the vulnerable application, needs to be tricked into accessing the attacker's malicious HTML page in their browser.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to host the malicious HTML files and trick a logged-in administrator into accessing those pages. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the application, as the CSRF vulnerability is exploited through the session of the logged-in user."
