Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2018-9334:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is due to a local privilege escalation issue in the PAN-OS management web interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269):** The vulnerability allows an authenticated user to gain access to password hashes of local users, indicating a flaw in how privileges are managed within the web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to access password hashes of local users.
*   **Confidentiality Impact: HIGH:** The disclosure of password hashes represents a significant breach of confidentiality.
*   **No Integrity or Availability Impact:** The vulnerability does not affect the integrity of the system or its availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Attack Vector:** The attack is launched locally, suggesting the attacker needs access to the system or a local network segment.
*   **Attack Complexity: LOW:** The attack is not complex to execute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with access to the PAN-OS management web interface.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system or network.
*   **Manipulation of HTML Markup:** The attacker needs to manipulate the HTML markup in the PAN-OS management interface.

**Summary:**

CVE-2018-9334 is a local privilege escalation vulnerability in the PAN-OS management web interface. An authenticated local user can manipulate HTML markup to gain access to password hashes of local users. The vulnerability is rated as medium severity due to the high confidentiality impact, but no impact on integrity or availability.
