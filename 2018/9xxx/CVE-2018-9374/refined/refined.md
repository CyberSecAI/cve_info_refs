{
  "CVE-2018-9374": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "When a runtime permission of a group is already granted, the other permission of the group is automatically granted when requested. If a granted permission changes its group during an update, a permission from a potentially not approved group may get auto-granted.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "Improper permission handling during group changes.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Elevation of Privilege (EoP): An application may obtain permissions that the user did not explicitly grant, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive resources.",
    "Attack vectors": "An application that had a permission granted that changes groups can potentially get auto-granted the new group permission without the user's explicit consent.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs an application installed on the device, that has been granted a permission that changes its group during an update."
