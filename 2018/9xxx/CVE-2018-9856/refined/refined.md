- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Kotti application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) when assigning local roles via the `@@share` view. The application does not implement anti-CSRF tokens to protect these actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing CSRF protection. The vulnerability allows an attacker to force a logged-in user to perform actions (in this case, changing document ownership and permissions) without their knowledge or consent.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can manipulate a victim's browser to send a forged request to the Kotti application, changing the owner of a document and the access rights. In the example provided, a regular user (`testuser`) can be made the owner of an admin-owned document (`admin-document`), effectively granting full control of that document to the attacker. This could lead to unauthorized access and modification of sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is conducted via a malicious HTML page that includes a form. When an authenticated user visits this malicious page, their browser sends the forged request to the vulnerable Kotti application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to lure a logged-in victim into visiting a malicious page that makes a request to the vulnerable Kotti application. The attacker does not need direct access to the victim's account, only their active session.
