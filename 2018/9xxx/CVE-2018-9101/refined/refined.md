Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a combination of SQL injection and Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities present in MiVoice Connect and ST 14.2

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the application's queries, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the database.
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to information theft or malicious actions on behalf of the user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The vulnerabilities could lead to the exposure of user information stored in the database. This may include sensitive data, potentially leading to identity theft, unauthorized access to accounts, and/or compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **SQL Injection:** Attackers would likely exploit the SQL Injection vulnerability through manipulated user input or requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Reflected XSS:** Attackers would likely deliver malicious scripts via a crafted URL or input that reflects on the web page, targeting users that access the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send malicious SQL queries (for SQL injection) or inject malicious JavaScript (for XSS) through the application to a vulnerable system. This could mean the attacker might require a network connection to the server hosting the vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory explicitly mentions that the risk of these vulnerabilities is rated as "high".
- Mitel has released updates to address these vulnerabilities and advises customers to upgrade to the latest software versions.
- The provided content includes a link to the security bulletin (18-0003-001) which may contain further technical details.
