  "CVE-2018-9126": {
    "related_content": true,
    "summary": "The DNNArticle module 11 for DNN (formerly DotNetNuke) allows remote attackers to read the web.config file, and consequently discover database credentials, via the /GetCSS.ashx/?CP=%2fweb.config URI.",
    "root_cause": "The DNNArticle module's GetCSS.ashx handler does not properly sanitize or validate the 'CP' parameter, allowing directory traversal.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Directory Traversal"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, including the web.config file which contains sensitive information such as database credentials.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP GET request to `/desktopmodules/DNNArticle/GetCSS.ashx` with a crafted `CP` parameter containing a path traversal sequence (`%2fweb.config`)."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability."
