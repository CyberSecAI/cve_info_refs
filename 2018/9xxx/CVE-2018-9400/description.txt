In gt1x_debug_write_proc and gt1x_tool_write of
    drivers/input/touchscreen/mediatek/GT1151/gt1x_generic.c and gt1x_tools.c,
    there is a possible out of bounds write due to a missing bounds check. This
    could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges
    needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.
