- **Root cause of vulnerability:** SysInfo is installed with setuid root permissions by default, which allows any local user to execute the program with root privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in how the SysInfo program is designed, allowing a local user to launch a root shell due to its setuid root permissions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local user can gain full access to the local system by launching a root shell.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a local user with access to execute SysInfo.
