Based on the provided article, here's the information related to CVE-2018-9314:

**CVE-2018-9314** is one of the 14 vulnerabilities found in BMW cars by Tencent's Keen Security Lab. This vulnerability, along with others, allows an attacker to inject messages into the vehicle's CAN bus and Engine Control Unit (ECU) while the car is in motion.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The article mentions a "backdoor" in the infotainment unit. While the specific nature of this backdoor is not detailed (it could be an admin account with a default or no password, or hardcoded credentials), it allows a USB connection to bypass the infotainment system and reach the vehicle's K-CAN bus.
*   The reuse of Texas Instruments code to operate the special memory of the Jacinto chip to send CAN messages was also a contributing factor to the vulnerabilities.
*   Lack of proper security design on diagnostic functions of the ECUs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Backdoor in Infotainment Unit:** An unspecified vulnerability allows unauthorized access to the K-CAN bus from the infotainment system.
*   **Lack of Diagnostic Security:** The ECUs respond to diagnostic messages even at normal driving speeds, allowing for manipulation using those messages and routines.
*   **Memory Corruption:** A memory corruption vulnerability in the Telematics Control Unit (TCB) allows bypassing signature protection and achieving remote code execution in the firmware.
*   **Insecure CAN Bus Communication:** Vulnerabilities allow injection of messages into the CAN bus from the infotainment system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Vehicle Control:** Attackers could potentially take over or interfere with the operation of the vehicle, including the engine control unit (ECU), by injecting arbitrary diagnostic messages.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** A memory corruption vulnerability in the TCB could lead to remote code execution.
*   **Manipulation of Diagnostics:** Attackers can send diagnostic messages to ECUs even during normal driving, potentially causing serious security issues.
*   **Arbitrary Message Injection:** Attackers can inject arbitrary messages into the CAN bus.
*   **Triggering of BMW Remote Services:** Arbitrary messages could be sent to BMW Remote Services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **USB Connection:** Physical access via USB to the infotainment unit.
*   **Bluetooth:** Wireless attacks via Bluetooth to the infotainment unit.
*   **Cellular Network:** Wireless hijacking via the cellular phone network.
*  **OBD diagnostics port:** Physical access via the OBD port.
* **GSM Network Simulation:** Triggering BMW Remote Services through a simulated GSM network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Access:** In some instances, physical access to the car via USB or OBD diagnostics port is needed.
*   **Remote Access:** Other vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely via Bluetooth or the cellular phone network, as well as through GSM network simulation.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** Reverse engineering of firmware and understanding of CAN bus communication is required to exploit some vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**
* The article mentions that the full technical report is being withheld until March 2019 to allow for patching.
* The vulnerabilities were confirmed on BMW i3, X1, 525Li, and 730Li models, with the telematics control unit issues affecting models produced since 2012.
