Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9544:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content contains a commit message and an Android Security Bulletin that directly reference CVE-2018-9544 and bug ID A-113037220. Therefore the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Analysis:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies within the HID (Human Interface Device) component of the Android system, specifically in the `register_app` function. It appears there's an issue related to Out-Of-Bounds (OOB) access when registering an application.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary weakness is an out-of-bounds write, which can occur when the HID device registers an application.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Exploiting this vulnerability allows for information disclosure and potentially leads to arbitrary code execution within a privileged process. The severity is rated as "High."
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves a remote attacker who can gain access to data normally only accessible to locally installed applications with permissions. The vulnerability exists in the Bluetooth subsystem.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs the ability to interact with the Bluetooth service. They would also likely need to send specially crafted messages to trigger the OOB write within the `register_app` function.

**3. Technical Details and Descriptions**

*   The commit message associated with the fix for CVE-2018-9544 states "HID Device: Fix OOB in register_app". This clearly identifies the issue as an out-of-bounds write during the HID device's application registration process.
*   The vulnerability is described as enabling a "remote attacker to access data normally accessible only to locally installed applications with permissions."

**4. Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is located within the Bluetooth component of the Android system.
*   The Android Security Bulletin indicates that the fix for this issue is included in the 2018-11-01 security patch level.
*   The associated commit has a change ID of `I91bcd5032959458b926c479160c7e391b8de313b`.
*   There is also a mention of a related bug ID: 113111784. This is related to CVE-2018-9545 which is a separate but related issue (also present in the Bluetooth component). This suggests that both CVEs might have a common root cause or be related.

**Summary:**

CVE-2018-9544 involves an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the HID component's `register_app` function within the Android Bluetooth subsystem. Exploitation could lead to information disclosure or potentially code execution, allowing a remote attacker to access data normally restricted to locally installed applications with permissions. The vulnerability was addressed with the 2018-11-01 security patch.
