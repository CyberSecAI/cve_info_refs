Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the inclusion of hard-coded credentials within a JavaScript file (`login_par.js`). These credentials are used for authentication to the PrismaWEB management interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hard-coded Credentials:** The primary vulnerability is the storage of the username (`prismaweb`) and password (`prisma`) directly within the publicly accessible `login_par.js` file.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The presence of these credentials allows an attacker to bypass the intended authentication mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full System Access:** Successful exploitation grants an attacker administrative privileges on the PrismaWEB system.
*   **Security Bypass:** The hard-coded credentials effectively bypass the system's security controls.
*   **Potential DoS:** The advisory from zeroscience mentions "DoS" as one of the possible impacts, although the direct method isn't described and may be a secondary impact after gaining access, by misconfiguration.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Access to `login_par.js`:** An attacker can directly access the `login_par.js` file by navigating to the specific URL `http://<target>/user/scripts/login_par.js`, where target represents the ip address of the vulnerable device.
*   **Network Accessibility:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely, assuming the PrismaWEB server is accessible over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the vulnerable system's web server.
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic understanding of web navigation and how to access web resources.
*   No need for any specific exploit or software, just a web browser or the `curl` command.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The affected version is Prisma Industriale Checkweigher PrismaWEB 1.0 (Rev 21, EPROM 202FWSAM ??).
*   The vulnerability was tested on an HMS AnyBus-S WebServer.
*   The username is `prismaweb` and the password is `prisma`.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Gjoko 'LiquidWorm' Krstic.
*   The vendor was contacted but there was no response, leading to a public release of the advisory.
*   The advisory provides a curl command to fetch the vulnerable file `login_par.js` to get the credentials.
*   The vulnerability is also assigned to CVE-2018-9161, which is referenced in the advisory.
