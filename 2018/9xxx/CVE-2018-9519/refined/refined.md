Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9519:

**CVE-2018-9519:** This CVE refers to a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's HID debug driver. The specific commit that addresses this vulnerability is `717adfdaf14704fd3ec7fa2c04520c0723247eac`. The vulnerability was categorized as an Elevation of Privilege (EoP) with a moderate severity.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a missing length check before copying data to user space using the `copy_to_user()` function within the HID debug driver. If the length of the data being copied exceeds the size of the user-provided buffer, a buffer overflow occurs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `copy_to_user()` operation. The code does not validate the length of data to be copied against the size of the user buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Elevation of Privilege:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can potentially gain elevated privileges. This is because the buffer overflow could overwrite kernel memory, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not explicitly stated, the ability to overwrite kernel memory through a buffer overflow often can lead to arbitrary code execution, as the attacker could overwrite function pointers or other critical data structures.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system to trigger the vulnerability, since it is through the debug interface.
*   **User Space to Kernel Space:** An attacker in user space can trigger the vulnerable code in kernel space by interacting with the HID debug driver, specifically when reading debug information, and passing a buffer smaller than the debug output.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to interact with the HID debug driver, which generally requires some level of access to the device.
*   The attacker needs to be able to specify the size of the user buffer passed to the ioctl, such that is smaller than the length of the debug information that will be copied.

**Additional Notes**
* The fix adds a length check before calling `copy_to_user`.
* The provided git commit diff clearly shows the added check.
* The android security bulletin confirms the vulnerability and provides a link to the upstream kernel commit.
