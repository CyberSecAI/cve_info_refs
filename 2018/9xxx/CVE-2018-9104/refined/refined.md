- **Root cause of vulnerability**: SQL injection and Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities exist within the MiVoice Connect and ST 14.2 products.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - SQL Injection: This allows an attacker to manipulate database queries, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    - Reflected XSS: This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages, which are then executed by unsuspecting users, potentially leading to information disclosure or other malicious actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerabilities can lead to the exposure of user information stored in the database.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vectors involve exploiting the vulnerabilities in the MiVoice Connect (formerly named Connect ONSITE) and ST 14.2 applications, specifically through malicious SQL queries and injected scripts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be able to interact with the vulnerable applications. The specifics are not detailed, but this suggests that the attacker needs to be able to make requests to the vulnerable software.
