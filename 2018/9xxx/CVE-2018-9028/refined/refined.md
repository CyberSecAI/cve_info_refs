The provided content is related to CVE-2018-9028.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the use of unsalted passwords within the CA Privileged Access Manager.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The system stores user passwords without applying a salt before hashing. This makes them susceptible to offline attacks like rainbow table lookups or dictionary attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker who gains access to the password hashes can more easily crack them due to the absence of salts. This could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts and potentially the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves an attacker gaining access to the password database or system where password hashes are stored.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to obtain the database or system containing the unsalted password hashes. This could involve compromising the system, database, or a backup.
