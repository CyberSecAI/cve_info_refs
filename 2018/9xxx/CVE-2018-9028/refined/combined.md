Issued: June 14, 2018

Last Updated: June 14, 2018

CA Technologies Support is alerting customers to multiple potential risks with CA Privileged Access Manager. Multiple vulnerabilities exist that can allow a remote attacker to conduct a variety of attacks.  These risks include seven vulnerabilities privately reported within the past year to CA Technologies by security researchers, and nine vulnerabilities for Xceedium Xsuite that were publicly disclosed in July 2015.  CA Technologies acquired Xceedium in August 2015, and Xceedium products were renamed and became part of Privileged Access Management solutions from CA Technologies.

The first vulnerability, CVE-2018-9021, has a high risk rating and concerns the ajax\_cmd.php file, which can allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands.

The second vulnerability, CVE-2018-9022, has a high risk rating and concerns configuration file poisoning, which can allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.

The third vulnerability, CVE-2018-9023, has a medium risk rating and concerns the update\_crld script, which can allow an unprivileged user to gain root privileges.

The fourth vulnerability, CVE-2018-9024, has a low risk rating and concerns IP spoofing in logs, which can allow a remote attacker to masquerade as another machine.

The fifth vulnerability, CVE-2018-9025, has a low risk rating and concerns insufficient input validation on the login page, which can allow a remote attacker to poison a log file.

The sixth vulnerability, CVE-2018-9026, has a medium risk rating and concerns insecure handling of user sessions in multiple scripts, which can allow a remote attacker to conduct session fixation attacks.

The seventh vulnerability, CVE-2018-9027, has a medium risk rating and concerns insufficient input validation in multiple scripts, which can allow a remote attacker to conduct reflected XSS attacks.

The eighth vulnerability, CVE-2015-4664, has a high risk rating and concerns insufficient input validation in the login.php script, which can allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands.

The ninth vulnerability, CVE-2015-4665, has a medium risk rating and concerns insufficient input validation in the ajax\_cmd.php script, which can allow a remote attacker to conduct reflected XSS attacks.

The tenth vulnerability, CVE-2015-4666, has a high risk rating and concerns insufficient input validation in the read\_sessionlog.php script, which can allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to conduct directory traversal attacks and download sensitive information.

The eleventh vulnerability, also CVE-2015-4664, has a high risk rating and concerns insufficient input validation by the spadmind script, which can allow a local attacker to execute privileged commands.

The twelfth vulnerability, CVE-2015-4667, has a low risk rating and concerns the use of hard-coded credentials in multiple scripts, which can allow an attacker to potentially conduct a variety of attacks.

The thirteenth vulnerability, CVE-2015-4669, has a high risk rating and concerns insecure database credentials, which can allow a local user to conduct a variety of attacks.

The fourteenth vulnerability, CVE-2015-4668, has a low risk rating and concerns the openwin.php script, which can allow a remote attacker to conduct open redirect attacks.

The fifteenth vulnerability, CVE-2018-9028, has a low risk rating and concerns unsalted passwords, which can allow an attacker to more easily crack passwords.

The sixteenth vulnerability, CVE-2018-9029, has a medium risk rating and concerns insufficient input validation in multiple scripts, which can allow an attacker to conduct SQL injection attacks.
