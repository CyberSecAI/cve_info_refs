The provided content describes a vulnerability in MetInfo related to password reset functionality, specifically how it can be exploited via a Host header injection attack.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application uses the `HTTP_HOST` header from the incoming request to construct the password reset link sent in the email. This header is directly used without validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation: The application does not validate or sanitize the `HTTP_HOST` header.
- Host header injection: An attacker can manipulate the `Host` header in the password reset request.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Account takeover: By manipulating the `Host` header, an attacker can generate a malicious password reset link pointing to a server they control. When the legitimate user clicks the link, the attacker can intercept the reset token and use it to change the user's password.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a password reset request with a malicious `Host` header.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs to know the email address associated with the target user account.
- Attacker must be able to send requests to the vulnerable MetInfo instance.
