This occurs as the application improperly ignores the changes to the “/NeedsRendering” key or “TextField” field when verifying the XFA documents. | * Jörn Henkel |\n| Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to an Information Disclosure vulnerability when handling certain XFA documents with the “app.openDoc” function, certain PDF files with the ‘’LaunchAction” function, or submitting form data in certain XFA documents with encryption elements. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to exfiltrate XFA data from other documents on the file system or from SMB servers, retrieve NTLM information, or access form data.
