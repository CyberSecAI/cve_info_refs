This document mentions CVE-2018-9313 as one of the vulnerabilities discovered in BMW vehicles by Tencent's Keen Security Lab.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The article mentions a "backdoor" in the infotainment unit. While the specific nature of the backdoor is not detailed, it allows a USB connection to bypass the infotainment unit and access the vehicle's K-CAN bus.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-   **Backdoor in Infotainment Unit:** Allows unauthorized access to the K-CAN bus via USB.
-   **Insecure Diagnostic Function:** ECUs respond to diagnostic messages even at normal driving speeds, making them vulnerable to malicious commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Access to CAN Bus:** The "backdoor" allows access to the vehicle's K-CAN bus.
-   **Control of Vehicle Systems:** Attackers can inject messages into the CAN bus and engine control unit, potentially interfering with or taking control of vehicle operation.
-   **Arbitrary Diagnostic Messages:** Attackers can send arbitrary diagnostic messages to the ECUs.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Physical USB access:** Plugging a booby-trapped gadget into a USB port to access the K-CAN bus via the infotainment unit's "backdoor".
-   **Bluetooth Attack:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the infotainment unit via Bluetooth.
-   **Cellular Network Attack:** Hijacking the car's hardware via the cellular network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Physical Access:** Required for exploiting vulnerabilities via USB.
-   **Proximity:** Required for Bluetooth based attacks.
-   **Remote Access:** Possible via cellular network for certain vulnerabilities.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects BMW models with infotainment units produced from 2012 onwards.
- The article also mentions a memory corruption vulnerability in the telematics control unit that allows for remote code execution, although this is not directly related to CVE-2018-9313.
- The researchers were able to "influence the vehicle via different kinds of attack chains".
