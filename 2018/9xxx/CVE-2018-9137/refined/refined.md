Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-9137:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the CSV export functionality of Open-AudIT versions prior to 2.2. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize or escape characters in fields that are exported to CSV files. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into a CSV field.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CSV Injection (Formula Injection):** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled input before exporting it to a CSV file. This allows an attacker to embed malicious formulas or commands within the CSV data.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:**  If a user opens the crafted CSV file with Microsoft Excel, and ignores the warning that Excel will execute the data contained in the CSV, the injected commands within the CSV will be executed. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. In the provided example, it's shown that the `calc` command can be executed, but in theory any command can be injected and executed.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious CSV injection:** An attacker injects malicious characters and commands in the first character of a field such as =, +, -, @.
*   **Target user action:** The targeted user must then download the data to a CSV file and open the file using MS Excel or a similar tool that interprets formulas and ignores the warning, triggering the execution of the injected commands.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Access to Open-AudIT:** The attacker must have an account in Open-AudIT with permissions to modify items or data fields that are exported to CSV.
*   **Knowledge of CSV Injection:** The attacker needs to understand how CSV injection works and how to craft malicious payloads.
*   **User interaction:** The attacker needs to trick the user into opening the maliciously crafted CSV file to trigger the execution of commands.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability was fixed in Open-AudIT version 2.2, which includes a configuration item called `output_escape_csv` that, when set to 'y' by default, adds a single quote before the injected characters to prevent the execution of formulas.
*   The Exploit-DB entry provides a specific example of a malicious payload: `@SUM(1+1)*cmd|' /C calc'!A0`.
*   The severity is considered low due to the required user interaction needed to open the malicious CSV and ignore the warning from MS Excel.
* The identified vulnerable versions are Open-AudIT 2.1 and earlier.
