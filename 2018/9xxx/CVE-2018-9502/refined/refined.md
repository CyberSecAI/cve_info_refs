Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9502:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in a missing or incorrect check within the `rfc_parse_data` and `rfc_process_mx_message` functions in the Bluetooth stack. Specifically, the code was not properly validating the length of data being processed, leading to a potential out-of-bounds read.

*   **Weakness:** An insufficient bounds check when parsing Bluetooth data. The vulnerability stems from a lack of validation on the length of the remaining frame data being processed during the parsing of rfc messages.

*  **Impact:** The vulnerability is classified as an "Information Disclosure". It could allow an attacker to potentially leak memory contents from a Bluetooth process.

*   **Attack Vector:** A proximate attacker can exploit this vulnerability via a crafted Bluetooth message. This indicates that the attacker needs to be in Bluetooth range of the target device.

*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have the ability to send specially crafted Bluetooth messages to a vulnerable device.

**Technical Details**

*   The fix involves adding boundary checks in the `rfc_parse_data` function and also adding a check to the remaining frame length in the `rfc_process_mx_message` function. These checks will prevent the code from reading beyond the allocated buffer.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Multiple commits were involved in fixing this issue.
*   The vulnerability is present in Android versions 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, 8.1 and 9.
