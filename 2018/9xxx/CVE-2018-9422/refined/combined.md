| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1604217#c0)  Laura Pardo    2018-07-19 21:35:28 UTC  ``` An unoptimized code of key handling for shared futexes was found in the Linux kernel in the form of unbounded contention time due to the page lock for real-time users. Before the fix the page lock was a heavy unnecessary lock for the futex path that protected too much. After the fix the page lock is only required in a specific corner case.

Probably, there is a confusion about the commit messages as it mentions "one rare race". Actually no race was addressed by the commit but the commit message could be interpreted so, as fixing a race related to shmem pages and a swapcache.   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1102001#c0)  Johannes Segitz   2018-07-20 07:22:04 UTC  ``` rh#1604217  A flaw was found in the way futex deals with the key handling for shared futexes. This allows a rare race condition that requires the page lock in the slow path when examining the swapcache.  Upstream Patch: <https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/65d8fc777f6dcfee12785c057a6b57f679641c90>  References: <https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2018-07-01> <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1604217> <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-9422> ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1102001#c2)  Michal Hocko   2018-07-23 09:30:04 UTC  ``` Let's involve Mel.

I admit I'm confused and it does not help that neither the CVE link nor the bulletin includes information about how privileges can be escalated. At minimum, the attacker would need access to the same shmem data holding the shared mutex so the attacker has at least similar privilege already. I do not see how this translates into privilege escalation.  The intent of that patch was to address real-time users concerns about unbounded contention time due to the page lock. I wonder if the CVE is based on confusion about the changelog -- particularly the first paragraph? Before the patch, the page lock was a heavy unnecessary lock for the futex path that protected too much. After the patch, the page lock is only required in a specific corner case. No race was being addressed but the changelog could be interpreted as fixing a race related to shmem pages and swapcache.  If this patch is backported then commit 48fb6f4db940e92cfb16cd878cddd59ea6120d06 should be included. That fixes a case whereby an application bug can trigger a kernel warning (harmless but annoying). ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1102001#c4)  Michal Hocko   2018-07-23 10:27:53 UTC  ``` (In reply to Mel Gorman from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1102001#c3)) > (In reply to Michal Hocko from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1102001#c2)) > > Let's involve Mel.

                 CVE-2018-1000204
Debian Bug     : 898165

The previous update to linux failed to build for the armhf (ARM EABI
hard-float) architecture.  This update corrects that.  For all other
architectures, there is no need to upgrade or reboot again.  For
reference, the relevant part of the original advisory text follows.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2017-5715

    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various
    processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker
    controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary
    addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes
    running on the system.

    This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 2 (branch
    target injection) and is mitigated for the x86 architecture (amd64
    and i386) by using new microcoded features.

    This mitigation requires an update to the processor's microcode,
    which is non-free.  For recent Intel processors, this is included
    in the intel-microcode package from version 3.20180425.1~deb8u1.
    For other processors, it may be included in an update to the
    system BIOS or UEFI firmware, or in a later update to the
    amd64-microcode package.

    This vulnerability was already mitigated for the x86 architecture
    by the "retpoline" feature.

CVE-2017-5753

    Further instances of code that was vulnerable to Spectre variant 1
    (bounds-check bypass) have been mitigated.

CVE-2018-1066

    Dan Aloni reported to Red Hat that the CIFS client implementation
    would dereference a null pointer if the server sent an invalid
    response during NTLMSSP setup negotiation. This could be used by a
    malicious server for denial of service.

    The previously applied mitigation for this issue was not
    appropriate for Linux 3.16 and has been replaced by an alternate
    fix.

CVE-2018-1093

    Wen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image could trigger
    an out-of-bounds read in the ext4_valid_block_bitmap() function. A
    local user able to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this for
    denial of service.

CVE-2018-1130

    The syzbot software found that the DCCP implementation of
    sendmsg() does not check the socket state, potentially leading
    to a null pointer dereference.  A local user could use this to
    cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2018-3665

    Multiple researchers have discovered that some Intel x86
    processors can speculatively read floating-point and vector
    registers even when access to those registers is disabled.  The
    Linux kernel's "lazy FPU" feature relies on that access control to
    avoid saving and restoring those registers for tasks that do not
    use them, and was enabled by default on x86 processors that do
    not support the XSAVEOPT instruction.

    If "lazy FPU" is enabled on one of the affected processors, an
    attacker controlling an unprivileged process may be able to read
    sensitive information from other users' processes or the kernel.
    This specifically affects processors based on the "Nehalem" and
    "Westemere" core designs.

    This issue has been mitigated by disabling "lazy FPU" by default
    on all x86 processors that support the FXSAVE and FXRSTOR
    instructions, which includes all processors known to be affected
    and most processors that perform speculative execution.  It can
    also be mitigated by adding the kernel parameter: eagerfpu=on

CVE-2018-5814

    Jakub Jirasek reported race conditions in the USB/IP host driver.
    A malicious client could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption), and possibly to execute code, on a
    USB/IP server.

CVE-2018-9422

    It was reported that the futex() system call could be used by an
    unprivileged user for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-10853

    Andy Lutomirski and Mika Penttilä reported that KVM for x86
    processors did not perform a necessary privilege check when
    emulating certain instructions.  This could be used by an
    unprivileged user in a guest VM to escalate their privileges
    within the guest.

CVE-2018-10940

    Dan Carpenter reported that the optical disc driver (cdrom) does
    not correctly validate the parameter to the CDROM_MEDIA_CHANGED
    ioctl.  A user with access to a cdrom device could use this to
    cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2018-11506

    Piotr Gabriel Kosinski and Daniel Shapira reported that the
    SCSI optical disc driver (sr) did not allocate a sufficiently
    large buffer for sense data.  A user with access to a SCSI
    optical disc device that can produce more than 64 bytes of
    sense data could use this to cause a denial of service (crash
    or memory corruption), and possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-12233

    Shankara Pailoor reported that a crafted JFS filesystem image
    could trigger a denial of service (memory corruption).  This
    could possibly also be used for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-1000204

    The syzbot software found that the SCSI generic driver (sg) would
    in some circumstances allow reading data from uninitialised
    buffers, which could include sensitive information from the kernel
    or other tasks.  However, only privileged users with the
    CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_SYS_RAWIO capability were allowed to do this,
    so this has little or no security impact.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.57-1.  This update additionally fixes Debian bug #898165, and
includes many more bug fixes from stable update 3.16.57.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

Debian Bug     : 898165

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

This update is not yet available for the armhf (ARM EABI hard-float)
architecture.

CVE-2017-5715

    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various
    processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker
    controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary
    addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes

## Commit Message

```

The tls ulp overrides sk->prot with a new tls specific proto structs.
The tls specific structs were previously based on the ipv4 specific
tcp_prot sturct.
As a result, attaching the tls ulp to an ipv6 tcp socket replaced
some ipv6 callback with the ipv4 equivalents.

This patch adds ipv6 tls proto structs and uses them when
attached to ipv6 sockets.

# Android Security Bulletin—July 2018

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

*Published July 2, 2018 | Updated July 3, 2018*

The Android Security Bulletin contains details of security vulnerabilities
affecting Android devices. Security patch levels of 2018-07-05 or later address
all of these issues. To learn how to check a device's security patch level, see
[Check and update
your Android version](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705).

Android partners are notified of all issues at least a month before
publication. Source code patches for these issues have been released to the
Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository and linked from this bulletin.
This bulletin also includes links to patches outside of AOSP.

The most severe of these issues is a critical security vulnerability in Media
framework that could enable a remote attacker using a specially crafted file to
execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process. The
[severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are turned off for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

We have had no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of these newly
reported issues. Refer to the
[Android and Google Play Protect mitigations](#mitigations)
section for details on the
[Android security platform protections](/docs/security/enhancements)
and Google Play Protect, which improve the security of the Android platform.

**Note:** Information on the latest over-the-air update (OTA) and
firmware images for Google devices is available in the
[July 2018
Pixel / Nexus Security Bulletin](/docs/security/bulletin/pixel/2018-07-01).

## Android and Google service mitigations

This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the
[Android security platform](/docs/security/enhancements)
and service protections such as
[Google Play Protect](https://www.android.com/play-protect).
These capabilities reduce the likelihood that security vulnerabilities
could be successfully exploited on Android.

* Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by
  enhancements in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users
  to update to the latest version of Android where possible.
* The Android security team actively monitors for abuse through
  [Google Play Protect](https://www.android.com/play-protect)
  and warns users about
  [Potentially Harmful Applications](/static/security/reports/Google_Android_Security_PHA_classifications.pdf). Google Play Protect is enabled by default on devices
  with [Google Mobile Services](http://www.android.com/gms), and is
  especially important for users who install apps from outside of Google
  Play.

## Common questions and answers

This section answers common questions that may occur after reading this bulletin.

**1. How do I determine if my device is updated to address these issues?**

To learn how to check a device's security patch level, see
[Check
and update your Android version](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices).

* Security patch levels of 2018-07-01 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2018-07-01 security patch level.
* Security patch levels of 2018-07-05 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2018-07-05 security patch level and all previous patch levels.

Device manufacturers that include these updates should set the patch string level to:

* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2018-07-01]
* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2018-07-05]

**2. Why does this bulletin have two security patch levels?**

This bulletin has two security patch levels so that Android partners have the
flexibility to fix a subset of vulnerabilities that are similar across all
Android devices more quickly. Android partners are encouraged to fix all issues
in this bulletin and use the latest security patch level.

* Devices that use the 2018-07-01 security patch level must include all issues
  associated with that security patch level, as well as fixes for all issues
  reported in previous security bulletins.
* Devices that use the security patch level of 2018-07-05 or newer must
  include all applicable patches in this (and previous) security
  bulletins.

Partners are encouraged to bundle the fixes for all issues they are addressing
in a single update.

**3. What do the entries in the *Type* column mean?**

Entries in the *Type* column of the vulnerability details table reference
the classification of the security vulnerability.

| Abbreviation | Definition |
| RCE | Remote code execution |
| EoP | Elevation of privilege |
| ID | Information disclosure |
| DoS | Denial of service |
| N/A | Classification not available |

**4. What do the entries in the *References* column mean?**

Entries under the *References* column of the vulnerability details table
may contain a prefix identifying the organization to which the reference value belongs.

| Prefix | Reference |
| A- | Android bug ID |
| QC- | Qualcomm reference number |
| M- | MediaTek reference number |
| N- | NVIDIA reference number |
| B- | Broadcom reference number |

**5. What does a \* next to the Android bug ID in the *References*
column mean?**

Issues that are not publicly available have a \* next to the Android bug ID in
the *References* column. The update for that issue is generally contained
in the latest binary drivers for Pixel / Nexus devices available from the
[Google Developer site](https://developers.google.com/android/drivers).

**6. Why are security vulnerabilities split between this bulletin and
device/partner security bulletins, such as the Pixel / Nexus bulletin?**

Security vulnerabilities that are documented in this security bulletin are
required in order to declare the latest security patch level on Android devices.
Additional security vulnerabilities that are documented in the
device / partner security bulletins are not required for declaring
a security patch level. Android device and chipset manufacturers are encouraged
to document the presence of other fixes on their devices through their own security
websites, such as the
[Samsung](https://security.samsungmobile.com/securityUpdate.smsb),
[LGE](https://lgsecurity.lge.com/security_updates.html), or
[Pixel / Nexus](/docs/security/bulletin/pixel)
security bulletins.
