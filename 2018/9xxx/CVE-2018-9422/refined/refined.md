Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2018-9422:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an unoptimized code path in the Linux kernel's handling of shared futexes. Specifically, the page lock used in the futex path was an unnecessarily heavy lock that protected too much, leading to unbounded contention time, particularly for real-time users. This lock was required when examining the swapcache on the "slow path".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unoptimized Locking:** The original futex implementation used a heavy page lock in a way that caused contention and performance issues.
- **Potential Race Condition:** While initially considered as the root cause by some reports, it was determined that a true race condition was not the primary problem. However, the locking inefficiency was present.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** While there is some debate and conflicting information, the primary impact was initially reported as a privilege escalation. However, some analysis suggested that a true privilege escalation might not be easily achievable, although it was theoretically possible in certain scenarios.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The heavy locking and contention issues could lead to a denial of service condition for real-time users due to the unbounded wait times when acquiring the lock.
- **Contention:** Unnecessary contention on the page lock could degrade performance, especially in real-time scenarios.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Exploitation:** The vulnerability was triggered by using the `futex()` system call, which is accessible to unprivileged local users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unprivileged User:** An attacker only needed to be a local unprivileged user capable of making `futex()` system calls and having access to shared memory where a futex resides.
- **Access to shared memory:** The attacker would need access to the same shmem data holding the shared futex, which, according to some analysis, implies that the attacker likely has similar privileges already.
- **Ability to trigger the slow path**: The attacker needs to trigger the "slow path" which involves swapcache examination.

**Additional Notes:**
- The original issue was related to the futex implementation causing unbounded contention times for real-time users due to unnecessary page locking.
- Patches were introduced to reduce the scope of the page lock, only requiring it in specific corner cases, which drastically reduces the locking overhead in the normal futex path.
- There was some confusion initially about whether the issue was related to a race condition, however, it was confirmed that a race was not being fixed by the patch.
- The CVE was initially associated with privilege escalation, but some experts questioned its practicality and the conditions required to achieve it.
- The issue was addressed in the Linux Kernel 4.6-rc1.
- Some sources state the vulnerability is not exploitable.
