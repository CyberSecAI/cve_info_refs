The provided content is related to CVE-2018-9122.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the Crea8Social Social Network Script, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities (both stored and reflected) are present. Specifically, these vulnerabilities exist in:
    -  Post comments
    -  User profiles
    -  Posts
    -  Search feature

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to:
    - Privilege escalation allowing a normal user to potentially hijack an admin's account.
    - Client-side JavaScript code execution on other users' browsers.
    - Information disclosure, enabling attackers to steal session cookies or private information.

**Attack vectors:**
    - Injecting malicious scripts in comments, user profiles, and posts, which are then stored and executed when other users view them (stored XSS).
    - Injecting malicious scripts through search queries, which are executed when the search results page is displayed (reflected XSS).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - An attacker only needs to create a normal user account on the vulnerable Crea8Social platform.
    - The attacker needs to be able to post content, modify their profile, or perform search queries, depending on the specific vulnerability exploited.
