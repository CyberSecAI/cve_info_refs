Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9558:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an issue in the Near Field Communication (NFC) component within the Android system. The provided commit message indicates "Prevent OOB error for T2T read/write". This suggests an out-of-bounds (OOB) read/write error when handling T2T (Tag to Tag) communication, specifically with NFC tags.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

The primary weakness is an out-of-bounds read or write vulnerability, likely occurring during the processing of NFC tag data in the NFC subsystem. This can lead to memory corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**

The impact is elevation of privilege (EoP). If exploited, it could allow a local attacker to potentially gain elevated privileges within the context of a privileged process.

**Attack vectors:**

The attack vector involves exploiting a vulnerability in the way NFC handles T2T communication which allows for data manipulation during NFC tag read/write operations.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

The attacker needs to be local, meaning they would need to have a malicious app installed on the device or be able to otherwise interact with the NFC functionality of the affected device. They would also need to be able to manipulate or create a malicious NFC tag to trigger the vulnerable code path.

**Additional Notes**
*   The commit message refers to a bug ID of 112161557, which corresponds with the provided CVE reference from the Android Security Bulletin.
*   The fix involves adding code to prevent the out-of-bounds access when processing NFC data from T2T read/write operations
