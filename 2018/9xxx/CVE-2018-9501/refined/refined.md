Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9501:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists in the Settings app, specifically related to device lock settings when the device is not yet provisioned.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- When a device is not provisioned and the Settings app is launched, the entry point for changing the device lock is still present. Additionally, the search panel and search menu are still visible on the settings home page. This implies that a user might be able to modify lock settings, potentially leading to unintended access or manipulation before the device is properly set up.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially change or disable the device lock before the device is provisioned. This would allow unauthorized access to the device, potentially compromising user data and privacy.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have physical access to the device.
- The attacker needs to launch the Settings app on an unprovisioned device and navigate to the device lock settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Physical access to the device in an unprovisioned state
- Ability to navigate the user interface of the settings app

**Additional Details:**
The provided commit logs clarify the fix:
- Disables the entry point for changing device lock settings when the device is not yet provisioned.
- Removes the search panel from the settings home page when the device is not yet provisioned.
- Removes the search menu option when the device is not yet provisioned.
These changes prevent access to device lock settings and search functionality when the device isn't properly provisioned, thereby resolving the vulnerability.
