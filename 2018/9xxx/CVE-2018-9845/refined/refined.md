Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-9845:

**CVE Description:** The provided text includes "Access Control bypass on /admin - CVE-2018-9845" which matches the CVE ID.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the way Etherpad Lite handles authentication and authorization for the `/admin` path. Specifically, it is related to the `webaccess.js` file which contains logic to control access to different parts of the application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
   - **Authentication Bypass:** The code was vulnerable to an authentication bypass due to a case-sensitivity issue when checking the path for `/admin`.
   - The original code used `req.path.indexOf('/admin') != 0` which is case sensitive. If the `/admin` is specified in any other case, like `/Admin` it would bypass the check.

**Impact of exploitation:**
    - **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could gain access to the admin interface without proper authentication.
    - **Administrative actions:**  Access to the admin interface would grant the attacker the ability to perform administrative actions such as managing users, settings, and plugins.

**Attack vectors:**
    - **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker can send a crafted HTTP request with a modified path (e.g., `/Admin`, `/aDmIn`) to bypass the authentication check and access the admin panel.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Etherpad Lite server.
    - **No Prior Authentication:** The attacker doesn't need prior valid credentials since the vulnerability allows to bypass authentication

**Technical Details:**

The relevant change in `webaccess.js` is:

   // Do not require auth for static paths and the API...this could be a bit brittle
   if (req.path.match(/^\/(static|javascripts|pluginfw|api)/)) return cb(true);
 
-  if (req.path.indexOf('/admin') != 0) {
+  if (req.path.toLowerCase().indexOf('/admin') != 0) {
     if (!settings.requireAuthentication) return cb(true);
     if (!settings.requireAuthorization && req.session && req.session.user) return cb(true);
   }
```
The fix is to convert the path to lowercase (`req.path.toLowerCase()`) before checking if it starts with `/admin`, which resolves the case-sensitivity issue.
