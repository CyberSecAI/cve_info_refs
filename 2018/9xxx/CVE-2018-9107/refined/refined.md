Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper handling of user-controlled input when exporting data to a CSV file within the AcyMailing extension for Joomla. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user-provided data before including it in the CSV file, leading to CSV injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **CSV Injection:** The core vulnerability is CSV injection, also known as Excel Macro Injection or Formula Injection. This occurs when a program exports data into a CSV file without sanitizing or escaping special characters. When a user opens the crafted CSV file in spreadsheet software like Excel or LibreOffice Calc, these characters are interpreted as formulas instead of text, allowing malicious code to be executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** If a malicious formula is inserted into the CSV, it could execute arbitrary code on the machine of the user opening the file, giving the attacker the ability to run any command on the system. This could lead to a variety of malicious activities like installing malware, stealing data, or performing other actions. In the provided example, the calculator is launched, but much more malicious commands could be crafted.
- **Data Exfiltration:**  It's theoretically possible for the attacker to craft formulas to extract data or sensitive information from the spreadsheet and send it to an external location.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **User Input via Acymailing Component:** The primary attack vector is through user-controlled input within the AcyMailing extension. In this case, the username field is modified by a lower-privileged user.
- **CSV Export:** The vulnerability is triggered when a higher-privileged user exports user data via the AcyMailing component, which generates the malicious CSV file.
- **Victim Action:** The attack requires the victim (a user with higher privileges) to download and open the malicious CSV file using spreadsheet software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low-Privileged User Access:** The attacker needs access to the Joomla site as a user with permissions to modify their user profile and access Acymailing component.
- **Knowledge of CSV Injection:** The attacker needs to be aware of the potential for CSV injection and how to craft malicious formulas.
- **Victim Interaction:** The attack requires a higher-privileged user to export data, download and open the CSV file.

**Additional Information**

- The vulnerable component is "AcyMailing Starter" versions prior to 5.9.6.
- The exploit was tested on Ubuntu 14.04 x86_64/Kali Linux 4.12 i686.
- The vulnerability is resolved in version 5.9.6 of AcyMailing Starter.
- The exploit is demonstrated by changing the user's name to a malicious string before exporting.
