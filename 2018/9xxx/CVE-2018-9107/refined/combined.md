Injection
# Google Dork: N/A
# Date: 22-03-2018
################################
# Exploit Author: Sureshbabu Narvaneni
################################
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.acyba.com
# Software Link: https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/acymailing-starter/
# Affected Version: 5.9.5
#Category: WebApps
# Tested on: Ubuntu 14.04 x86_64/Kali Linux 4.12 i686
# CVE : CVE-2018-9107

1. Vendor Description:

AcyMailing is a reliable Newsletter and email marketing extension for
Joomla.
It enables you to efficiently manage an unlimited number of subscribers,
organize them into mailing lists, send personalized newsletters (Hi
{name}...)

2. Technical Description:

CSV Injection (aka Excel Macro Injection or Formula Injection) exists in
the export feature in the Acyba AcyMailing extension before 5.9.6 for
Joomla! via a value that is mishandled in a CSV export.

3. Proof Of Concept:

Login as low privileged user who is having access to Acymailing Component.
Rename user name as @SUM(1+1)*cmd|' /C calc'!A0.

When high privileged user logged in and exported user data then the CSV
Formula gets executed and calculator will get popped in his machine.

4. Solution:

Upgrade to version 5.9.6
https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/acymailing-starter/

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

[Tobi Gurtner (2).](/profile/profile/details/194973)

Posted on 23 May 2024

###### Functionality

Great functions and a great integration-possibility. We use it for all communication with our own MVC components.

It is easy to use for non technical person as well for us as Joomla and component Developers since 2009.

###### Support

If you are really in need. The team in France will help you. :-)

###### Support

###### Documentation

Bad, not exists, not german translated version, documentation is not useable

I used this to:
Newsletter and campaign, Contact forms and auto response, Newsletter and campaign, Contact forms and auto response
Owner's reply:
Hello,

AcyMailing is fully translated in German:

If the texts are not translated on your website, you can go in the AcyMailing configuration page, tab "Languages" and click the "Edit" icon next to the German language then click the "Load the latest version from our server" button. Once loaded, click the "Save" button and refresh the page => AcyMailing should be shown in German now.

Our documentation is indeed not translated in German as none of us masters this language. This is why our documentation is written in English, so that you could activate the browser translation tool.

Note that we focus more and more on adding tips and explanations directly in AcyMailing (the "(i)" next to options) so that users only need our documentation for very specific cases.

#### [Has become buggy and pushes to 'subscribe'](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/acymailing-starter/#rev-125021)

[rookey (2).](/profile/profile/details/8533)

Posted on 06 February 2024

###### Functionality

This extension was great before but isn't anymore. Changing subscriptions in the current version produces an error message.

###### Ease of use

No easy and simple download anymore, users are required to 'register' on their website. Not matching Joomla standards.

###### Support

Error message "0 method\_exists(): Argument #1 ($object\_or\_class) must be of type object|string, null given" when trying to change subscr

###### Documentation

I used this to:
Joomla 3 plugin, not sure which version I received through auto-update

#### [Much Commercial - Voilating OpenSource GNU/GPL rules](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/acymailing-starter/#rev-124655)

[Varma (1).](/profile/profile/details/547763)

Posted on 27 November 2023

###### Functionality

Functionalities are there but give lot of problems with Joomla 4 & 5

###### Ease of use

Not really easy to use. Using Acymailing seems harmful and not beneficial for open-source customers.

###### Support

I purchased the extension few months ago and have generated lot of issue for me on my website, and I reached them several times still no use

###### Documentation

Since they depend on an open-source platform under the GNU/GPL, restricting users from using the entire extension after the license expires.

I used this to:
While it's acceptable to restrict users from upgrading the version or receiving continued support after the license period, controlling the entire extension not to work and running vulnerable background scripts after the license expiration is a security risk.

#### [Powerful and versatile](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/acymailing-starter/#rev-123351)

[Didier Pollez (12).](/profile/profile/details/109255)

Posted on 15 March 2023

###### Functionality

Very versatile and easy to adapt for any type of use and many add-ons for other Joomla extensions.

###### Ease of use

It takes some getting used to but once you know the basics it is easy to configure and use.

###### Support

Top support, very quick answer and solution via the forum or ticket system.

###### Documentation

Very extensive description and documentation and forum, but necessary.

I used this to:
I used this to: I use it to send emails when new articles, events or documents appear. Users can subscribe and unsubscribe from the newsletters.

#### [The worst upgrade ever!](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/acymailing-starter/#rev-122347)

[HDsports (11).](/profile/profile/details/207255)

Posted on 20 September 2022

###### Functionality

Acyba 5 to 6/7 is the worst upgrade ever. Lost lot of functionality (f.e.: add more articles in a newsletter in one step)

###### Ease of use

very complex. With Acyba 5 it was easy to create an newsletter in less minutes. But with Acyba 6/7 you spend hours without success

I used this to:
Sending newsletter to 10,000 peoples.

Insert existing articles in the newsletter

#### [Great functionality, let down by customer focus](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/acymailing-starter/#rev-122307)

[Stephen Hart (2).](/profile/profile/details/323872)

Posted on 13 September 2022

###### Functionality

Very powerful with plenty of options, have used for many years. Enterprise membership provides front end functionality, which is excellent.

###### Ease of use

Some idiosyncrasies in naming of functions that make it less intuitive than it could be, but pretty good overall.

###### Support

Big watchout. Support weak and weirdly touchy. No tracking of support tickets. Got suspended from forum for pointing out lack of response.

###### Documentation

Has improved but not always keeping up with changes. Would say I find what I need quickly about 70% of the time.

I used this to:
Managing mailing lists, newsletters and membership comms for a Society.

Assigning send roles to others from front end.
Owner's reply:
Hi,

Any news about this?

Regards,

Alexandre.

#### [Nice Look, No result](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/acymailing-starter/#rev-122244)

[John (1).](/profile/profile/details/543373)

Posted on 29 August 2022

###### Functionality

It worked 9 years ago (Enterprise version, exorbitant cost). Since 2018 after purchasing upgraded version it stopped working.

###### Ease of use

It has all the ease to send emails but when your emails are not opened even 3% then it has neither ease nor result.

###### Support

Alexandre has no help to offer. He says: o unfortunately I've no "way" to rectify something as it might comes from tons of different reasons

###### Documentation

No manual available to help how to make sure of delivery of the emails as mails sent to me was also not received.

I used this to:
Sending news emails to clients. No question to by new version if there has been bad experience.

#### [A fantastic tool to avoid external e-mail services that do not comply with our GDPR policy](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/acymailing-starter/#rev-122171)

[Carlos (6).](/profile/profile/details/419246)

Posted on 18 August 2022

###### Functionality

I must admit that this is not a tool that I just installed. It is a tool that I have been using for over 10 years. It works great!

###### Ease of use

It is very easy to use once you get used to it. I have to say that this review is for the product acymailing essential. That is I paid 29 €

###### Support

Support is great. At least for the paying version. It is worth every cent.

###### Documentation

It is pretty self-explanatory everything. I am not sure if there is a documentation site, but at least, I did not need it.

I used this to:
I used it for 10 years. We do not want to use services like mailchimp or others, cause that would mean that We would need to transfer e-mail addresses of our subscribers to an external provider, which we are not allowed, following the GDPR Directive.
