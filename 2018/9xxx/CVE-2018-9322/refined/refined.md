The content discusses multiple vulnerabilities found in BMW vehicles by Tencent's Keen Security Lab, and it mentions CVE-2018-9322 as one of them. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerabilities stem from various issues in the car's infotainment system, telematics control unit, and wireless communication hardware.
*   Specifically, one vulnerability was due to the reuse of Texas Instruments code for operating the memory of the Jacinto chip, which allows sending CAN messages, and lack of proper security measures in diagnostic functions.
*   A "backdoor" in the infotainment unit was mentioned, but specific details are not given.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CAN bus Injection:** Attackers can inject messages into the vehicle's CAN bus and engine control unit (ECU), potentially interfering with vehicle operation.
*   **Memory Corruption:** A memory corruption vulnerability in the telematics control unit (TCB) allows bypassing signature protection and achieving remote code execution in the firmware.
*   **Insecure Diagnostics:** ECUs respond to diagnostic messages even at normal driving speeds, which could be exploited to reset the ECU or invoke other routines.
*   **"Backdoor" in Infotainment:** The presence of a "backdoor" that allows a USB connection to bypass the infotainment unit and reach the K-CAN bus to attack individual devices.
*   **Bluetooth Vulnerability**: Infotainment system is susceptible to over-the-air attacks via Bluetooth.
*   **Cellular Network Hijacking**: The car's hardware can be wirelessly hijacked through the cellular phone network.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Vehicle Control Interference:** Attackers could potentially take over or interfere with the operation of the vehicle.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Attackers can achieve remote code execution in the firmware of the telematics control unit.
*   **ECU manipulation:** Attackers can send arbitrary diagnostic messages to the ECUs, potentially resetting them or invoking other critical routines.
*   **Compromise of Vehicle Systems:** The ability to attack individual devices through the K-CAN bus.
*   **Data access or exfiltration** by gaining access to infotainment unit or other systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Exploitation:** Some vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely via Bluetooth or the cellular network.
*   **Physical Access:** Some vulnerabilities require physical access to the vehicle through USB or the ODB diagnostics port.
*   **Indirect Physical Access:** Some vulnerabilities require "indirect" physical access to the machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Attacker:** Can exploit vulnerabilities from outside the vehicle via Bluetooth or cellular network access.
*   **Physical Access:** Needs to be inside the vehicle with physical access to USB or ODB port for certain exploits.
*  **Ability to Simulate GSM network:** Ability to simulate a GSM network to trigger remote services.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerabilities affect BMW models equipped with the telematics control module produced from 2012 onwards.
*   The research was conducted on BMW i3, X1, 525Li, and 730Li models.
*   BMW has issued over-the-air updates for some bugs, while others require dealer-based patches.
*   Tencent is withholding full technical details until March 2019 to allow time for patching.
