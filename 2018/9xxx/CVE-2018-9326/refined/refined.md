Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The primary root cause is an arbitrary code execution vulnerability present in Etherpad version 1.6.3.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  The core vulnerability is that an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server running Etherpad.
*   **Unspecified Mechanism:** The specific mechanism or method that allows this arbitrary code execution is not detailed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full System Compromise:**  Arbitrary code execution can lead to complete compromise of the server where Etherpad is running. An attacker could potentially gain full control of the system.
*   **Data Breach:**  Attackers may be able to access, modify, or delete sensitive data stored within the Etherpad instance and potentially the system.
*   **Malware Deployment:** An attacker could deploy malware or other malicious software.
*   **Service Disruption:** The attacker could cause a denial of service and make the server unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is network-accessible (AV:N) meaning it can be exploited remotely over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:**  No prior authentication is needed (Au:N/PR:N), meaning the attacker does not need any valid credentials to launch an attack.
*   **Low Attack Complexity:**  The attack is of low complexity (AC:L), indicating that exploiting the vulnerability does not require special skills or complex steps, making it relatively easy to exploit.
*  **No User Interaction:** The vulnerability does not require any user interaction (UI:N).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The blog post mentions additional vulnerabilities fixed in version 1.6.4, including another arbitrary code execution vulnerability and a vulnerability allowing pad export without knowing the name, but these are not specifically related to CVE-2018-9326.
*   The vulnerability is present specifically in version 1.6.3 and addressed in 1.6.4.
*   The vulnerability is considered HIGH severity based on CVSS scores.
