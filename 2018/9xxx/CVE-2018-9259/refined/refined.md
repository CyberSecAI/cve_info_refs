- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The MP4 dissector in Wireshark could crash due to a malformed packet. Specifically, over-deep MP4 chunks may cause stack exhaustion.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient validation of MP4 chunk depth, leading to potential stack exhaustion.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Wireshark can be made to crash.
- **Attack vectors:** Injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs to be able to inject malformed packets into the network or provide a malformed capture file to a Wireshark user.
- **Affected versions:** 2.4.0 to 2.4.5, 2.2.0 to 2.2.13
- **Fixed versions:** 2.4.6, 2.2.14
