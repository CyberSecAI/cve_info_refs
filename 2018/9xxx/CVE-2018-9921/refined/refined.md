{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The CMS Made Simple web application allows an admin user to upload a custom checksum verification file. This feature, intended for verifying file integrity, is vulnerable to directory traversal.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Directory Traversal: The application allows the user to specify file paths outside the webroot by using '..\\', enabling access to sensitive system files.",
      "Information Disclosure: The vulnerability allows an attacker to probe for existence of files and directories, also potentially fingerprinting the version of known binaries by comparing md5 hashes."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can probe the file system for the existence of files and directories, allowing them to gather information about the system. By comparing md5 hashes, the attacker can also fingerprint the application and binaries present on the server. This information may facilitate further attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker must first be able to log in to the admin dashboard",
        "The attacker uploads a modified checksum file containing directory traversal sequences and paths to files or directories outside of the web root."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires administrative access to the CMS Made Simple web application to utilize the custom checksum functionality. They need to be able to create and upload a specially crafted checksum file."
