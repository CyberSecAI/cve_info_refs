{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the handling of depth hierarchy for SPS parameters in the HEVC decoder. The specification dictates that max_transform_hierarchy_depth_inter and max_transform_hierarchy_depth_intra cannot be greater than the difference between log2_ctb_size and log2_min_transform_block_size.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation leading to out-of-bounds read/write.",
       "Lack of proper bounds check on the depth hierarchy of SPS parameters"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) due to out-of-bounds memory access.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a crafted HEVC stream that violates the depth hierarchy limits, which is handled by the media framework of Android devices.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted HEVC stream, likely through a malicious application or by intercepting network traffic."
  },
  "additional_details": "The provided commit messages indicate that the fix adds limits checking for the depth hierarchy SPS parameters and also ensures that errors are returned for invalid SPS sub-layer parameters and for negative values of `max_dec_pic_buffering` and `num_reorder_pics` SPS parameters."
