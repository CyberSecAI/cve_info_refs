It means, multiple vulnerabilities exist in SAP HANA Extended Application Services, advanced.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Multiple security vulnerabilities are present in SAP HANA Extended Application Services, advanced. The blog post does not specify the exact nature of each vulnerability.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** The CVSS score associated with the note ([7.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)) indicates high confidentiality impact, low integrity impact, and no availability impact.
