{
  "CVE-2018-2399": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the Process Monitoring Infrastructure, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts in the context of a user's browser session, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is network-based, requiring a user to interact with a crafted URL or injected script through the vulnerable component.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into the Process Monitoring Infrastructure. This could be achieved by crafting a specific URL that includes malicious JavaScript, or by injecting the script in another way. The user also needs to visit or interact with the injected code."
