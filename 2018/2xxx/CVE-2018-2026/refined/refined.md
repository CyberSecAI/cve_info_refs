Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-2026:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a potential directory listing issue within IBM Financial Transaction Manager for Corporate Payment Services (FTM CPS) and Financial Transaction Manager for Digital Payments (FTM DP).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Listing:** The core weakness is that the application might allow an authenticated user to obtain a directory listing of internal product files. This suggests inadequate access controls or insecure directory traversal handling.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially gain access to internal product files, which could contain sensitive information, configuration details, or code, potentially leading to further attacks.
*   The CVSS score indicates a low impact on Confidentiality with a CVSS base score of 4.3 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N), meaning there is no impact on Integrity or Availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is over the network (AV:N)
*   **Low Attack Complexity:** The attack complexity is low (AC:L)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the FTM CPS or FTM DP application. This means that the vulnerability is not directly exploitable by an anonymous user. The required privileges are low (PR:L)
*   **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is required for exploitation (UI:N)

**Affected Products and Versions:**
*   **FTM CPS:** v3.0.2.0 - 3.0.2.1, v3.2.1.0
*   **FTM DP:** v3.2.0.0 - 3.2.0.1, v3.2.1.0

**Fixes:**
Patches are available for the affected versions.
