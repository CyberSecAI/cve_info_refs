{
  "CVE-2018-2815": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The implementation of the StubIORImpl class in the Serialization component of OpenJDK did not limit the amount of memory allocated when creating an object instance from a serialized form.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Unbounded memory allocation during deserialization"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A specially-crafted input could cause a Java application to use an excessive amount of memory when deserialized, leading to a denial of service (memory exhaustion).",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Deserialization of specially crafted input"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Ability to provide a specially crafted input to a Java application"
    ]
  }
}
