# USN-3747-1: OpenJDK 10 vulnerabilities

21 August 2018

Several security issues were fixed in OpenJDK 10.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)

## Packages

* [openjdk-lts](/security/cves?package=openjdk-lts) - Java runtime based on OpenJDK (debugging symbols)

## Details

It was discovered that OpenJDK did not properly validate types in some

situations. An attacker could use this to construct a Java class that could

possibly bypass sandbox restrictions. ([CVE-2018-2825](/security/CVE-2018-2825), [CVE-2018-2826](/security/CVE-2018-2826))

It was discovered that the PatternSyntaxException class in OpenJDK did not

properly validate arguments passed to it. An attacker could use this to

potentially construct a class that caused a denial of service (excessive

memory consumption). ([CVE-2018-2952](/security/CVE-2018-2952))

Daniel Bleichenbacher discovered a vulnerability in the Galois/Counter Mode

(GCM) mode of operation for symmetric block ciphers in OpenJDK. An attacker

could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-2972](/security/CVE-2018-2972))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [openjdk-11-jre](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openjdk-lts)
  -
  [10.0.2+13-1ubuntu0.18.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openjdk-lts/10.0.2%2B13-1ubuntu0.18.04.1)
* [openjdk-11-jre-headless](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openjdk-lts)
  -
  [10.0.2+13-1ubuntu0.18.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openjdk-lts/10.0.2%2B13-1ubuntu0.18.04.1)
* [openjdk-11-jre-zero](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openjdk-lts)
  -
  [10.0.2+13-1ubuntu0.18.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openjdk-lts/10.0.2%2B13-1ubuntu0.18.04.1)

This update uses a new upstream release, which includes additional bug

fixes. After a standard system update you need to restart any Java

applications or applets to make all the necessary changes.
