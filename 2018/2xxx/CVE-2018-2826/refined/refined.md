Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-2826:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper validation of types within OpenJDK. This could allow an attacker to construct a malicious Java class.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper type validation in OpenJDK. This could potentially allow attackers to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could lead to a bypass of sandbox restrictions. This could allow for unauthorized actions or access within the Java environment.
- The NetApp advisory specifies that exploitation could result in a takeover of Java, a partial denial of service (DoS) of Java, or to the unauthorized reading or modification of a subset or all of the data accessible to the Java process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker crafts a specially designed Java class that exploits the type validation flaw.
- The NetApp advisory specifies the attack vector as network based with a high access complexity and a user interaction required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to create and execute a malicious Java class on a system running a vulnerable version of OpenJDK.
- The attacker requires a high level of access complexity and a user interaction to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The Ubuntu advisory groups this CVE with CVE-2018-2825, indicating a similar underlying vulnerability related to type validation in OpenJDK.
- The NetApp advisory groups this CVE with several other CVEs, which are related to vulnerabilities in Java SE. The impact of these other CVEs are similar.
- The NetApp advisory provides a list of affected products and provides remediation information which mainly consists of updating Java or the specific product.
