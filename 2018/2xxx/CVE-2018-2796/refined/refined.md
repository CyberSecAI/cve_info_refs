  "CVE-2018-2796": {
    "root_cause": "Unbounded memory allocation during deserialization in PriorityBlockingQueue.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unbounded memory allocation during deserialization."
    ],
    "impact": "A specially-crafted input could cause a Java application to use an excessive amount of memory when deserialized, leading to a denial of service via memory exhaustion.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability can be exploited by supplying data to the PriorityBlockingQueue API without using sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, such as through a web service.",
       "Deserialization of a specially-crafted input."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send serialized data to be deserialized using a vulnerable version of OpenJDK.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability is present in the PriorityBlockingQueue class within the Concurrency component of OpenJDK."
