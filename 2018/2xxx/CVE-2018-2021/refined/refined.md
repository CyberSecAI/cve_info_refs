Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-2021:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is that IBM QRadar SIEM allows users to embed code within the user interface (UI). This is due to insufficient input sanitization or output encoding.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. This means malicious scripts can be injected into the application, which are then executed by other users' browsers when they view the affected pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation can lead to the execution of malicious scripts in the browsers of other users interacting with the QRadar SIEM interface.
*  The content does not give specifics on what actions can be performed via the XSS attack, but it is known that with XSS an attacker can steal cookies, perform actions on behalf of the user, or deface the interface.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves embedding malicious code within the QRadar UI by an attacker. This could happen through various user input fields or through manipulation of application components that display user-generated content.
*  The specific method of injection is not outlined in this bulletin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to have the ability to interact with the IBM QRadar SIEM system and inject malicious code, meaning a user account, and access to the application that would allow for the injection to occur.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

*   IBM QRadar 7.3 to 7.3.2 GA
*   IBM QRadar 7.2 to 7.2.8 Patch 15

**Remediation:**

*   Apply the specified patches:
    *   IBM QRadar/QRM/QVM/QRIF/QNI 7.3.2 Patch 1
    *   IBM QRadar/QRM/QVM/QRIF/QNI 7.3.1 Patch 8
    *   IBM QRadar/QRM/QVM/QRIF/QNI 7.2.8 Patch 16
