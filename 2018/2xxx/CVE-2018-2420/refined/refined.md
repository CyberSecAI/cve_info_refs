**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an **Unrestricted File Upload** vulnerability in the SAP Internet Graphics Server (IGS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper restrictions on file uploads within the SAP IGS component. This means that an attacker can upload arbitrary files to the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The impact is rated as **Medium** severity with a CVSS score of 6.5.
*   While confidentiality (C:N) is not directly impacted, the vulnerability can lead to **Low** integrity impact (I:L) and **High** availability impact (A:H). The attacker could potentially overwrite existing files, inject malicious code into the system through uploaded files, or cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by filling the storage.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is **Network** (AV:N), meaning the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely via network access.
*   The attack complexity is **High** (AC:H).
*   No privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability (PR:N).
*   No user interaction is required (UI:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable SAP IGS.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any prior privileges on the system.

**Affected Versions:**

*   SAP Internet Graphics Server versions: 7.20, 7.20EXT, 7.45, 7.45, 7.49, and 7.53 are affected.
