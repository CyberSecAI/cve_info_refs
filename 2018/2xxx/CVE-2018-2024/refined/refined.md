- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Log file protocol in IBM QRadar SIEM has an incorrect permission assignment vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect permission assignment, where permissions to a resource can be read or modified by unintended actors.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Unintended actors could read or modify resources due to the incorrect permissions assignment. The specific impact would depend on the nature of the resources and the extent of modifications.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability resides in the Log File protocol within the QRadar SIEM. The specific attack vector is not described in the article beyond that.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to be in a position to interact with the vulnerable Log File protocol to exploit the incorrect permission assignment. Specifics are not provided.
