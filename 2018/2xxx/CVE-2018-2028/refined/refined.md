Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Reverse Tabnabbing issue. This occurs when a website opens a new tab or window, and the new page is able to modify the original page that opened it. In this case, an authenticated user of IBM Maximo Asset Management could be tricked into replacing the legitimate page with a phishing site.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reverse Tabnabbing vulnerability allows for modification of the original page.
- The weakness is in how the application handles the opening of new tabs or windows.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could replace a legitimate IBM Maximo Asset Management page with a phishing page.
- This could lead to the theft of highly sensitive user information, such as usernames, passwords, or other credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An authenticated user of IBM Maximo Asset Management is required.
- The user must interact with a link or function that opens a new tab or window.
- The attacker controls the content of the newly opened page which can then modify the content of the original page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious page that will modify the original page when opened as a new tab/window.
- The attacker must trick an authenticated user into opening the malicious page from within the IBM Maximo Asset Management application.
- The attacker would not likely need any special access to the Maximo application itself to exploit the weakness, only to be able to control the content of the linked page that the Maximo application opens.
