#### Why should you use DomainMOD?

##### Self-Hosted & Private

With privacy being such a hot topic these days, why would you hand all of your domain information over to someone else? With DomainMOD, only **you** have access to your data.

##### Central Management

In addition to keeping track of your domains you can also manage your SSL certificates, registrar and SSL accounts, web hosting, DNS servers, IP addresses, and more.

##### Multilingual Support

DomainMOD supports the Dutch, English (Canada), English (United States), French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish languages.

##### Registrar Importing

Get up-and-running in a flash by importing your domains using your registrar's API. Simply add the API credentials, choose the account, and let DomainMOD do the rest.

##### Bulk Domain Updater

There's no need to waste time updating your domains one-by-one, with the Bulk Updater you can modify as many domains as you want, all with a couple clicks.

##### Custom Data Fields

Using Custom Fields you can track an unlimited amount of information for your domains & SSL certificates. With the ability to export this data, the tracking possibilities are endless.

##### Reporting

Your data is virtually useless without the ability to make sense of it, so DomainMOD contains a Reporting section that allows you to run various reports against your data.

##### Segment Filters

Segments allow you to save lists of domains that you can use to filter against your main domains. You can see how many match, how many don't, and easily view the results.

##### User-Based Currencies

Every user can set their currency and it will be used throughout the entire system. Every setting, webpage, report, and export will automatically display values in the user's currency.

##### Task Scheduler

The Task Scheduler allows you to run system tasks at set times. You can run currency conversions, send emails about upcoming expirations, check for new versions, and more!

##### Data Warehouse

The Data Warehouse lets you import data from your WHM web servers, which you can then view, export, and run reports against in order to gain insight into your servers.

##### Mobile-Friendly

DomainMOD was designed from the ground up with mobile in mind, so you'll never have a problem accessing your data while you're on the go.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Project Home: <https://domainmod.org>

Project Demo: <https://demo.domainmod.org>

Documentation: <https://domainmod.org/docs/>

Source Code: <https://domainmod.org/source/>

## About

DomainMOD is an open source application written in PHP & MySQL used to manage your domains and other internet assets in a central location. DomainMOD also includes a Data Warehouse framework that allows you to import your web server data so that you can view, export, and report on your live data. Currently the Data Warehouse only supports web servers running WHM/cPanel.

## Live Demo

Not sure if DomainMOD is what you're looking for? Don't want to take the time to install it only to find out that it's not? We hate when that happens ourselves, which is why we've setup a live demo so you don't waste your time.

So go ahead, take the live demo for a test drive before you install: <https://demo.domainmod.org>

## Requirements

**Software**: PHP 8.1-8.2.9, MariaDB 10.4-11.1.2 or MySQL 5.7-8.1.0

**PHP Extensions**: PDO (MariaDB/MySQL), cURL, OpenSSL, gettext

**PHP Settings**: allow\_url\_fopen

## Downloading

There are currently four options for downloading DomainMOD.

**Option #1 -- Using Docker**

Please see our official DomainMOD container on Docker Hub for more information: <https://hub.docker.com/r/domainmod/domainmod>

**Option #2 -- Downloading a .zip file**

Visit the following URL to download DomainMOD in a .zip file: <https://domainmod.org/download/>

**Option #3 -- Using Git**

To download using Git, change to the directory where you want to install DomainMOD and run the following command (this download option requires that you have Git installed on your server):

```
git clone https://github.com/domainmod/domainmod.git

```

**Option #4 -- Installing via Softactulous**

Softaculous is the web hosting industry's leading software auto-installer, and it has helped millions of users install applications with a few clicks of a mouse. Softaculous easily integrates into the leading control panels like cPanel, Plesk, DirectAdmin, InterWorx, H-Sphere, and more. Check your hosting control panel or contact your web host if you're not sure if they offer Softaculous.

To install DomainMOD simply open Softaculous, use the search feature to find DomainMOD, and then click the "Install Now" button. After you answer a few questions about your installation Softaculous will do the rest.

More Information: <http://www.softaculous.com/softaculous/apps/others/DomainMOD/>

## Installing

If you installed DomainMOD using Docker or Softaculous in the previous step you can ignore the rest of this *Installing* section, as you should already have DomainMOD up-and-running.

If you downloaded the .zip file in the previous step, you will now need to upload the archive to your web server and then unpack it into the folder where you wish to install (or unpack it and then upload it, whichever you prefer).

If you used Git to retrieve the source code in the previous step, just change to the directory where you ran the git command and your files are already waiting for you in a folder called /domainmod/. Feel free to rename this folder to whatever you want.

**Installation Steps**

1. Create a MySQL database that will be used to store DomainMOD's data.
2. In the '\_includes' folder, copy config.SAMPLE.inc.php to config.inc.php and then update config.inc.php to reflect your web server's settings.
3. In a web browser, visit the URL where you just installed DomainMOD, enter the requested information, and then click the Install button. For example, example.com/domainmod/. After a few seconds a message will appear letting you know that the installation was successful.
4. Setup the below cron job on your web server.

## Cron Job

DomainMOD includes a Task Scheduler that allows you to run various system jobs at specified times, which helps keep your DomainMOD installation up-to-date and running smoothly, as well as notifies you of important information, such as emailing you to let you know about upcoming Domain & SSL Certificate expirations.

The Task Scheduler is very powerful, and it enables features that you otherwise wouldn't be able to use, but in order for it to function you need to schedule the below cron job to run on your web server. Once the cron job is setup to run, the Task Scheduler will be live.

If you installed DomainMOD using Docker, the cron job will be setup and running automatically within the container, so there's nothing you need to setup manually.

**NOTE:** This file should be executed every 10 minutes.

```
Filename: /cron.php

```

## Security

Although we've done our best to secure DomainMOD, unfortunately there are many factors that could cause security holes, such as the software being run on insecure hardware, software like PHP and MySQL having out-of-date versions with known vulnerabilities, easy-to-guess passwords being used, and so on. Due to these factors we recommend the following steps to help secure your DomainMOD installation.

1. Secure your installation with an SSL Certificate.
2. Do not use easy-to-guess passwords. **Ever**.
3. Although DomainMOD has its own authentication system, we recommend that you also use HTTP authentication on your installation directory to add an extra layer of security.
4. Do not store your account passwords or API keys in DomainMOD. Although the ability to save this information exists, **use it at your own risk**. This information is fairly secure if you run DomainMOD on your local computer, but there's a much higher risk of someone gaining access to it if you host the site on a server that is accessible to the outside world.

   **WARNING:** Saving your API keys (and other relevant API connection information) in DomainMOD is necessary if you want to use the Domain Queue, however we recommend that you only save this information temporarily while you're using the Domain Queue, and that you remove it as soon as you're done.
5. Do not host DomainMOD on a public website or on an easy-to-guess URL.

   If you do end up hosting DomainMOD on a public website, you should use your website's robots.txt file to block bots and spiders from crawling your site, otherwise your DomainMOD URL may end up in public search results.
6. Do not give the URL to anyone who does not need to access DomainMOD. You should treat the URL like a password.
7. Always use the most up-to-date version of DomainMOD. This will help protect you from any security vulnerabilities that are found and fixed.

## Upgrading

**WARNING:** Before upgrading it's **strongly** recommended that you backup your DomainMOD installation directory and database. If something goes wrong during the upgrade there may be no way to recover your data, and having a backup of your installation directory and database will allow you to easily restore your previous version. The Backup & Restore documentation can be found here: <https://domainmod.org/docs/userguide/backup-restore/>

**Option #1 -- Docker Install**

If you installed DomainMOD using Docker, please see our official DomainMOD container on Docker Hub for upgrade information: <https://hub.docker.com/r/domainmod/domainmod>

**Option #2 -- .zip File Install**

If you installed DomainMOD by downloading the .zip file, visit the following URL to download the most up-to-date version: <https://domainmod.org/download/>

Once the download completes, upload and unpack the new archive overtop of where you installed the previous version (or unpack it and then upload it, whichever you prefer).

**Option #3 -- Git Install**

If you installed DomainMOD using Git right from your web server, just run the following command from within your installation directory to upgrade:

```
git pull

```

**Option #4 -- Softaculous Install**

If you installed DomainMOD using Softaculous you're just a few clicks away from upgrading to the newest version. Please see the upgrade instructions on the Softaculous Wiki: <https://www.softaculous.com/docs/How_to_upgrade_installations>

## Data Warehouse

DomainMOD has a Data Warehouse framework built right into it, which allows you to import the data stored on your web server. Currently the only web servers that are supported are ones that run WHM/cPanel.

If your web server doesn't run WHM/cPanel, or you don't want to import your web server data into DomainMOD, you can ignore this section.

**NOTE:** Importing your web server(s) into the Data Warehouse will not modify any of your other DomainMOD data, nor any of the data on your web server.

**Supported Data**

The following WHM sections are currently supported, but our end goal is to have every piece of WHM information that can be retrieved via the API stored in the Data Warehouse.

**Accounts**

Domain, IP Address, Owner, User, Contact Email, Plan, Theme, Shell, Partition, Disk Limit, Disk Usage, Max Addons, Max FTP Accounts, Max Email Lists, Max Parked Domains, Max POP Accounts, Max SQL Accounts, Max Subdomains, Creation Date, Suspend Status, Suspend Reason, Suspend Time, Max Email Per Hour, Failed Email % Before Defer, Min Failed Email # Before Defer

**DNS Zones**

Zone Filename, Original/Primary Source of Zone Data, Admin Email, Serial #, Refresh, Retry, Expiry, Minimum TTL, Authoritative Name Server

**DNS Records**

TTL, Class, Type, IP Address, CNAME, Mail Server, Mail Server Priority, TXT Data, Line # of Zone, # of Lines, RAW Data
