  "CVE-2018-19486": {
    "description": "Git before 2.19.2 on Linux and UNIX executes commands from the current working directory (as if '.' were at the end of $PATH) in certain cases involving the run_command() API and run-command.c, because there was a dangerous change from execvp to execv during 2017.",
    "root_cause": "The `prepare_cmd()` function, responsible for locating commands in the PATH, did not correctly handle cases where a command was not found in the PATH. It would proceed to call `execv` directly with the command name, effectively searching the current directory, instead of returning an `ENOENT` error like `execvp` would.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper handling of PATH"
    ],
    "impact": "Allows execution of arbitrary commands from the current directory if a command is not found in the PATH. This can be abused by an attacker placing a malicious script in a directory and then tricking a user to execute git commands from within that directory using a non-qualified command name.",
      "attack_vectors": [
       "Executing git commands with a non-qualified command name from a directory where a malicious script with the same name exists"
      ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to place a malicious script with the same name as the target command in the current directory where the user is executing a git command. The user must execute a git command with a non-qualified command name from within this malicious directory.",
    "affected_systems": [
      "Linux",
       "UNIX systems using Git versions prior to 2.19.2",
       "Red Hat Software Collections (various RHEL versions)"
    ],
    "remediation": "Upgrade Git to version 2.19.2 or later."
