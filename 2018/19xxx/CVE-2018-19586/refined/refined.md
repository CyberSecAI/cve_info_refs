Based on the provided code, here's an analysis of the potential vulnerability related to CVE-2018-19586:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability likely stems from how the `FileUploadData` class handles the `X-FULL-PATH` header in the `from(HttpServletRequest request)` method. Specifically, the code decodes the URL using `URLDecoder.decode` and then normalizes the path using `StringUtil.normalize(fullPath)`. The issue arises if the normalization process is insufficient or can be bypassed, allowing an attacker to inject path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) into the `fullPath` variable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The core vulnerability is the potential for path traversal. If the `StringUtil.normalize` function is not robust enough, an attacker could craft a malicious `X-FULL-PATH` header containing `../` sequences that, after decoding, allow them to specify arbitrary file paths on the server.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The code relies on header values for file path construction, which is inherently risky. There might be insufficient sanitization of this path, leading to path traversal if normalization does not adequately address this.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Access/Overwrite:** A successful path traversal attack could allow an attacker to:
    -  Read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem that the web application has access to. This could include sensitive configuration files, application code, or user data.
    -  Potentially write or overwrite files, potentially leading to code execution or other malicious behavior.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Overwriting crucial application files could lead to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Header Manipulation:** The attacker would need to send a specially crafted HTTP request with a malicious `X-FULL-PATH` header. This could be achieved through various means, like using a web proxy or a scripting language to forge the request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the application server.
- **Ability to Forge HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with custom headers.
- **Knowledge of Target Application:** The attacker needs some knowledge of how the application works, specifically that it relies on the `X-FULL-PATH` header.

**Details Beyond CVE Description**
The code provides specific details on how the file path is constructed from the `X-FULL-PATH` header, which is not generally available in a standard CVE description. Specifically, the decoding and path normalization methods are revealed which can be helpful in understanding the vulnerability. The use of a custom `StringUtil.normalize` function suggests a potential area of weakness if it doesn't properly handle path traversal sequences.

**In summary**, the provided code reveals a potential path traversal vulnerability caused by insufficient sanitization of the `X-FULL-PATH` header. This vulnerability could allow attackers to access or overwrite arbitrary files on the server.
