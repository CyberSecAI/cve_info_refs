  "vulnerability_details": {
    "CVE-2018-19515": {
      "root_cause": "The system/ajax.php script offers various functionalities, which are supposed to be available for the administrator of the system only. However, by using specific query parameters, most of these methods become available without authentication.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Authentication bypass"
      ],
      "impact": "Allows unauthenticated users to access administrative functionalities, including dumping database contents containing sensitive information (email addresses) and system configurations including the admin password.",
      "attack_vector": "By sending crafted HTTP requests to `system/ajax.php` with specific query parameters such as `atment_sddd1xGz`, `bgsend`, or `xls_bgimport`.",
      "required_capabilities": "No authentication required. An attacker can trigger this remotely with a basic HTTP request."
