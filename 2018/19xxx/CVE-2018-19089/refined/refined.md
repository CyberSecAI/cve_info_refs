The provided content describes multiple XSS vulnerabilities in the 'tianti' project.

**1. Stored XSS in user list module:**

*   **Root cause:** Lack of input sanitization/validation when saving user roles. The application takes user-provided role names and descriptions and stores them in the database. The stored values are then displayed on the user list page without encoding or escaping.
*   **Weakness:** Stored XSS vulnerability. User-controlled data is stored and later displayed without proper sanitization.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the role name or description fields. When other users view the user list, the injected script will execute in their browser, potentially leading to cookie disclosure and privilege escalation.
*   **Attack vector:** A malicious user submits a role name containing a payload such as `"><img src=i onerror=alert(document.cookie)>` via the `/tianti-module-admin/user/ajax/save_role` endpoint.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to create/modify user roles.

**2. Stored XSS in article management module:**
   * **Root cause**: The article management module has a similar lack of input sanitization, allowing malicious script to be stored when creating or editing articles. This malicious script executes when the article is viewed by other users.
   * **Weakness**: Stored XSS vulnerability due to lack of sanitization on article content.
   * **Impact**: Similar to the previous vulnerability, an attacker can inject malicious scripts, leading to potential cookie theft or privilege escalation when other users view the article.
   * **Attack vector:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts via article creation or edit features.
   * **Attacker capabilities**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to create or modify articles.

**3. Reflected XSS in user management module:**

*   **Root cause:** The user management module allows searching for users based on keywords. The entered keyword is reflected back in the search results page without proper encoding.
*  **Weakness:** Reflected XSS vulnerability. User input is directly included in the response page without sanitization.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing a JavaScript payload, and if a user clicks this URL, the script will be executed in the user's browser. This could lead to cookie theft and other malicious activities.
*   **Attack vector:** A malicious user constructs a URL with the `userName` parameter containing a payload such as `"><img src=i onerror=alert(document.cookie)>` when searching for users via the `/tianti-module-admin/user/list` endpoint.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to trick a user to click a crafted URL.

**Mitigation advice:**

The reporter suggests implementing global interceptors to:

1.  **Intercept user requests** and check for potential threats.
2.  **Intercept responses** and replace special characters with their corresponding HTML entities, thus preventing XSS by encoding the output.
