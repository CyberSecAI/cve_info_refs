Root cause of vulnerability:
    - Insufficient TLB flushing after IOMMU mapping changes and improper large page mappings on AMD x86 platforms.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Xen hypervisor bypasses certain IOMMU flushes on AMD x86 hardware, which are necessary after removing memory mappings to prevent undue memory access.
    - Xen can recombine small page mappings into larger ones unsafely.
Impact of exploitation:
    - Privilege escalation
    - Denial of service
    - Information leaks
Attack vectors:
    - Malicious or buggy guest OS
Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - Must be able to control a guest OS that has access to physical PCI devices.
