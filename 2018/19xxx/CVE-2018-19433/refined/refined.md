The provided content describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `showdoc` project.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `install/database.php` file, where the `lang` parameter from the `$_REQUEST` is directly used in the HTML without proper sanitization or encoding. Specifically, the value of `$_REQUEST['lang']` is assigned to the `$cur_lang` variable, and this value is then placed directly into a hidden input field's value attribute: `<input type="hidden" value="<?php echo $cur_lang;?>" id="lang">`

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS. By injecting malicious JavaScript code into the `lang` parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the victim's browser.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not sanitize or encode the user-provided `lang` parameter before embedding it in the HTML.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to:
    - Stealing cookies or session tokens.
    - Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    - Defacing the website.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript code within the `lang` parameter.
- Specifically, accessing the URL: `http://127.0.0.1:4999/install/database.php?lang=%22%3E%3Csvg/onload=alert(/lambdax/)%3E` triggers the XSS vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with a malicious `lang` parameter and trick the victim into visiting it or inject the link elsewhere.
- The attacker can be remote (no special access to the server is required, beyond the ability to make an http request to the vulnerable page).
