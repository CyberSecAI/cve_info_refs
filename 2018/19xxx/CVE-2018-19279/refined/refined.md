Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- When using Prim'X ZoneCentral for Windows to encrypt local folders on an NTFS file system, very small files (under approximately 600 bytes) are briefly written to disk in clear text before being overwritten with their encrypted version. This is due to a delay in the encryption process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cleartext Exposure:** Small files are briefly exposed in clear text on disk before encryption.
- **Persistence on SSD:** On SSD disks, cleartext portions may remain longer due to the way SSD firmware operates.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker could potentially access the cleartext content of small files if they are able to intercept them within the short delay before encryption. This could lead to a breach of confidentiality.
- The impact is rated as "Low" because the exposure is brief and limited to small files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Physical Access:** The attack vector is physical, meaning the attacker needs physical access to the machine where ZoneCentral is running.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the machine.
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker can be a user with low-level privileges on the system.
- **Timing:**  The attacker needs to be able to access the disk during the brief window where the small files are present in cleartext.

**Affected Systems:**
- ZoneCentral for Windows versions prior to 6.1.2236, specifically when encrypting folders on an NTFS file system. This vulnerability does not affect network shares or other file systems.

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability is mitigated by updating ZoneCentral to version 6.1.2236 or higher.

**Additional Notes:**
- The files are overwritten with their encrypted version in less than 5 seconds.
- The vendor intentionally does not provide detailed information on the operating methods used to exploit the vulnerability to avoid misuse by malicious actors.
