- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The PNOZmulti Configurator software stores sensitive credential data in cleartext. This data is specifically related to the PMI m107 diag HMI device.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Clear-text Storage of Sensitive Information (CWE-312)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with local access to the system running the PNOZmulti Configurator can view sensitive credentials in cleartext. An attacker with this data and physical access to the PMI m107 diag HMI device can then modify data on the device.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the system with the PNOZmulti Configurator software is required to view the sensitive data. Physical access to the PMI m107 diag HMI is required to modify data on it, after obtaining the credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs local access to the system where the PNOZmulti Configurator is installed, and also needs physical access to the PMI m107 diag HMI device.
