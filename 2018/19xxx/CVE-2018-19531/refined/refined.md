```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `decodeXml` function in the template, when used without a configured `xml.codec`, defaults to `java.beans.XMLEncoder`. This class is vulnerable to remote command execution when processing untrusted XML data.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use of `java.beans.XMLEncoder` for XML processing without proper sanitization of user-controlled input.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote command execution on the server running the template engine.",
  "Attack vectors": "By providing a specially crafted XML payload via the `decodeXml` function, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to control the XML data that is processed by the `decodeXml` function within the template engine."
