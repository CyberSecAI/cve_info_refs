Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that GitLab's web UI improperly handles personal access tokens. Instead of restricting access based on the token's assigned scopes and permissions, it allows full access to the Web UI with the privileges of the user who issued the token, regardless of the token's intended scope, when the `private_token` parameter or `Private-Token` header is included in a request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Bypass of Token Scope Restrictions:** Personal access tokens, which are supposed to have limited permissions based on their scope, grant full access to the GitLab Web UI.
*   **Sessionless Login:** The attack does not create a conventional web session, making it difficult to detect unauthorized access via traditional user authentication logs.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with a restricted access token can gain all the permissions of the user who created the token, including the ability to generate additional access tokens with arbitrary permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Account Compromise:** An attacker who gets hold of any personal access token can effectively take over the account of the user who issued it.
*   **Data Exfiltration/Modification:** Once the attacker gains access, they can view, modify, or delete data accessible to the compromised user.
*   **Malicious Actions:** The attacker can perform any action within the application that the compromised user can perform, including creating new users, adding malicious code, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker can include a `private_token` parameter or `Private-Token` header in any HTTP request sent to the GitLab instance. This can be done manually or programmatically.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to a Personal Access Token:** The attacker needs to obtain a valid personal access token from a legitimate user. It's important to note that the scope of the token is irrelevant in this exploit.
*   **Network Access to GitLab Instance:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the GitLab server.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability was discovered in GitLab version "11.1.4-ee" but was suspected to also exist in other versions.
*   The RSS `feed_token` parameter might also be vulnerable in the same manner.
* The provided CVSS score is 7.6, indicating a high severity vulnerability.
