# Personal access token scope

From <https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/101860>:

> Due to a lack of time at the moment, this is not a nicely formatted report, but I think it is more important to get the message out.
>
> We are a penetration testing company and during an assignment last week with one of our clients, I discovered a security vulnerability in Gitlab:
>
> Using any “personal access token” regardless of the assigned scopes/permissions it is possible to access the full Web-UI with all functions and permissions of the issuing user.
>
> Including, issuing more access tokens with any scope/permission. To make things worse these session-less logins, don't show up in the user authentications or active web-sessions and it is thus hard to detect an ongoing attack.
>
> To achieve this, one only has to insert (manually or automatically) a “private\_token” parameter or “Private-Token” header into every request send by the browser.
>
> The tested Gitlab version was “11.1.4-ee [d17962f9](/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/commit/d17962f93455877eff70e4ad5dcc831d2469a8e0 "Update VERSION to 11.1.4-ee")” but looking at the source code it should also be present in the latest version and seems to be around for a while.
>
> After looking quickly at the source code the RSS “feed\_token” parameter may also be affected in the same way, but as the assignment is closed, I currently don’t have access to a Gitlab instance to check this.
>
> The current expected CVSS Score is 7.6 (High), as this issue at least constitutes a severe privilege escalation for restricted tokens and may have further impact depending on the user permissions and the exact use-case.
>
> CVSS-String: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L
>
> I hope this information is enough. If not, please don’t hesitate to contact me.
>
> Please note, that this vulnerability report is governed by our Vulnerability Disclosure Policy you can find attached.
>
> Thank you!

> Regards,
