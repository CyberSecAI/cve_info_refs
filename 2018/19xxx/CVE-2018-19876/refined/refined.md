Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a memory management issue in cairo when used with FreeType versions 2.9 and later. Specifically, when `FT_Get_MM_Var` is called, the memory it returns should be freed using `FT_Done_MM_Var` but cairo was using `free()` to release this memory which is incorrect when a custom memory allocator is configured and results in a crash. This is because FreeType uses its own memory management functions like `FT_ALLOC` and `FT_FREE` when configured with a custom allocator.
- This issue was introduced in cairo 1.16.0 when cairo started using FT_Get_MM_Var but is triggered when a custom memory allocator is configured in WebKit.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Invalid Free:** The core vulnerability is an invalid free, not a double free as initially suspected. `cairo_ft_apply_variations` was using `free()` to release memory allocated by FreeType's `FT_Get_MM_Var` when it should have used `FT_Done_MM_Var` if freetype version was >=2.9, leading to a heap corruption if a custom allocator is used as it's the case with WebKit. This happens because when using custom allocators `FT_ALLOC` and `FT_FREE` are used and `free` is not compatible with the memory allocated this way, corrupting the heap.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Crash:** The primary impact of this vulnerability is a crash due to memory corruption. This can lead to denial of service.
- **Potential for RCE (Remote Code Execution):** Although the immediate impact is a crash, the potential for remote code execution exists because memory corruption vulnerabilities can often be leveraged to gain control of the program.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Web Content:** The vulnerability is triggered via web content that renders text, which causes cairo to use the problematic code path in `cairo_ft_apply_variations` when a font with variations is used.
- **Specific FreeType versions:** The vulnerability is triggered when using FreeType version 2.9 and later in combination with cairo 1.16.0 and the custom allocator used by WebKit.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Ability to serve malicious web content:** The attacker needs to be able to serve web pages to the victim's browser. The malicious web page needs to load a font with variations.
- **Targeted environment:** The target system needs to be using cairo version 1.16.0 or later and FreeType version 2.9 or later and using WebKit.

**Additional details:**

- The bug report indicates that the issue was initially worked around in WebKit by avoiding the problematic code path based on the cairo version.
- A merge request was created in cairo to fix the underlying issue by using `FT_Done_MM_Var` when appropriate. This fix has been merged in the cairo repository but not yet released in an official version.
- The original reproducer stopped working at some point, which suggests that timing or environment details might play a role in triggering the vulnerability. However, the underlying issue remains.
- The vulnerability is not specific to a single application but to any application using cairo, freetype >= 2.9, and a custom memory allocator.
- CVE-2018-19876 was assigned to this issue.
