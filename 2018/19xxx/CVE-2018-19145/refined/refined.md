The provided content relates to CVE-2018-19145.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `search.php` file of the S-CMS application. Specifically, the `keyword` parameter is directly embedded into the HTML `value` attribute of an input field without proper encoding.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web page by manipulating the `keyword` parameter in the search function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to perform malicious actions on behalf of the user. This can include:
    - Stealing cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker would inject malicious JavaScript code in the `keyword` parameter of the search functionality via a GET request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted request to the vulnerable web page (S-CMS/search.php) with the malicious payload in the `keyword` parameter.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges or access to the server hosting the web application.
