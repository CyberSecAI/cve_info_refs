## Installation

Starting with Yoast SEO consists of just two steps: installing and setting up the plugin. Yoast SEO is designed to work with your site’s specific needs, so don’t forget to go through the Yoast SEO first-time configuration as explained in the ‘after activation’ step! For the most up-to-date guidance on how to install Yoast SEO products, [please visit our help center](https://yoast.com/help/yoast-installation-manuals/#h-yoast-seo-and-yoast-seo-premium-for-wordpress).

## FAQ

### How do the XML Sitemaps in the Yoast SEO plugin work?

Having an XML sitemap can be beneficial for SEO, as Google can retrieve essential pages of a website very fast, even if the internal linking of a site isn’t flawless.

The sitemap index and individual sitemaps are updated automatically as you add or remove content and will include the post types you want search engines to index. Post Types marked as noindex will not appear in the sitemap. [Learn more about XML Sitemaps](https://yoa.st/3qt).

### How can I add my website to Google Search Console?

It is straightforward to add your website to Google Search Console.

1. Create a Google Search Console account and login into your account.

2. Click ‘Add a property’ under the search drop-down.

3. Enter your website URL in the box and click ‘Continue’.

4. Click the arrow next to ‘HTML tag’ to expand the option.

5. Copy the meta tag.

6. Log in to your WordPress website.

7. Click on ‘SEO’ in the dashboard.

8. Click on ‘General’.

9. Click on the ‘Webmaster Tools’ tab.

10. Paste the code in the Google field and click ‘Save Changes’.

11. Go back to Google Search Console and click ‘Verify’.

If you want more details steps, please visit [our article on our help center](https://yoa.st/3qu).

### How do I implement Yoast SEO breadcrumbs?

The steps below are a temporary solution as manual edits made to theme files may be overwritten with future theme updates. Please contact the theme developer for a permanent solution. We’ve written an article about the [importance of breadcrumbs for SEO](https://yoa.st/3qv).

To implement the [breadcrumbs](https://yoa.st/3qw) function in Yoast SEO, you will have to edit your theme. We recommend that prior to any editing of the theme files, a backup is taken. Your host provider can help you take a backup.

Copy the following code into your theme where you want the breadcrumbs to be. If you are not sure, you will need to experiment with placement:

```
<?php
if ( function_exists( 'yoast_breadcrumb' ) ) {
    yoast_breadcrumb( '<p id="breadcrumbs">','</p>' );
}
?>

```

Common places where you could place your breadcrumbs are inside your `single.php` and/or `page.php` file just above the page’s title. Another option that makes it really easy in some themes is by just pasting the code in `header.php` at the very end.

In most non-WooTheme themes, this code snippet should not be added to your `functions.php` file.

Alternatively, you can manually add the breadcrumb shortcode to individual posts or pages: `[wpseo_breadcrumb]`

If you need more details or a step by step guide, read our [Implementation guide for Yoast SEO breadcrumbs](https://yoa.st/3qx).

### How do I noindex URLS?

Yoast SEO provides multiple options for setting a URL or group of URLs to noindex. [Read more about how to do this in this guide](https://yoa.st/3qy/).

### Google shows the wrong description, how do I fix this?

If you’ve crafted nice meta descriptions for your blog posts, nothing is more annoying than Google showing another description for your site completely in the search result snippet.

Possible causes could be:

1. wrong description in code

2. Google cache is outdated

3. Search term manipulation

4. Google ignored the meta description

You can [read more here on how to solve the issue with the wrong description](https://yoa.st/3qz).

### How often is Yoast SEO updated?

Yoast SEO is updated every two weeks. If you want to know why, please read [this post on why we release every two weeks](https://yoa.st/3q-)!

### How do I get support?

As our free plugin is used by millions of people worldwide, we cannot offer you all one on one support. If you have trouble with the Yoast SEO for WordPress plugin, you can get help on the support forums here at [wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wordpress-seo/) or by checking out our help center at [yoast.com/help/](https://yoa.st/3r1).

The plugins you buy at Yoast are called ‘premium plugins’ (even if Premium isn’t in its name) and include a complete year of free updates and premium support. This means you can contact our support team if you have any questions about that plugin.

2 star for the free version. Ive tried different SEO plugin I will not mentioned those names but I have publish a new website and I tried using this plugin for the 2nd time after several years but the features that were free before are now paid. Basically if you are using free version its just a bloated plugin so instead just use a different SEO plugin if you arent planning to get the premium one.
4 star for paid version. I can see a lot of good features but i dont have access since im only using free version maybe i can give this 5 star rating if im able to test out those paid features.

Essential for perfect SEO. Integration well with Elementor and other pagebuilders for me

I remember using this plugin a long time ago. Now I’ve come back to it for a new blog and it seems a lot more bloated than earlier versions. It still works, and is easy to use, but there are a lot of unnecessary features too. A lot of upselling and banner ads etc.
