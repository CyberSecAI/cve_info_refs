## Description

[![@Hexife](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10476944?u=1b4e4a24c2e74016f69a6e0abe76f7a6ea06f989&v=4&size=48)](/Hexife)[Hexife](https://github.com/Hexife)opened [on Nov 14, 2018](https://github.com/intelliants/subrion/issues/801#issue-380847801)

**Brief of this vulnerability**

In uploading process, Subrion allows to upload pht, phar files. There are able to execute as PHP script following server environment.

**Test Environment**

* Apache/2.4.18 (Debian)
* PHP 5.6.38-2+ubuntu16.04.1+deb.sury.org+1 (cli)

**Affect version**

4.2.1

**Payload**

1. move to `http://[address]:[port]/[app_path]/panel/uploads` with admin credential
2. Save php codes with pht or phar extensions. and upload it like below.

```
# test.pht
<?php system(id);?>

```

3. Right Click and Open the uploaded file name **or**

   move to `http://[address]:[port]/[app_path]/uploads/[uploaded file].`
4. Profit!

**Reason of This Vulnerability**

Subrion has `.htaccess` file for preventing execution of uploaded file.

```
# Deny files access for some file extensions
<FilesMatch "(?i)\.(php|php5|php4|php3|php2|phtml|pl|py|jsp|asp|htm|shtml|sh|cgi)$">
    ForceType text/plain
    Order Deny,Allow
    Deny from All
</FilesMatch>

# Process script files as plain text
AddHandler default-handler .php .php5 .php4 .php3 .php2 .phtml .pl .py .jsp .asp .htm .shtml .sh .cgi

```

In upload directory, `.htaccess` did not prevent execution of the files that have the `pht` and `phar` extensions. As a result, they are able to execute as PHP script.

I tested the `pht` extensions because my test environment is PHP 5.6, so `mod_php` can not execute `phar` extension scripts as PHP. But If Subrion installed in PHP 7.2+ envrionment, `phar` extension is also able to execute as PHP.
