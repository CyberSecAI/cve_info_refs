Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the "Jaeger URL" field on the operations settings page. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the field.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers when they visit the affected operations settings page. This can lead to various impacts such as session hijacking, data theft, and malicious actions performed on behalf of the victim.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is the "Jaeger URL" field in the project's operations settings page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have at least the "Maintainer" role in the project to access and modify the operations settings and inject the malicious script. Although the XSS is only visible to maintainers, a malicious user can be added as a maintainer to trigger the XSS.
