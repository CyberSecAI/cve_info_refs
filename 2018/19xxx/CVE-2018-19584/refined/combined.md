Title:         Disclosure of Private Group's Member and Milestone Details
Scope:         *.gitlab.com
Weakness:      None
Severity:      High
Link:          https://hackerone.com/reports/420492

Details:
PoC:
<https://gitlab.com/-/boards/813851/users.json>
<https://gitlab.com/-/boards/813851/milestones.json>

This is possible because the board endpoint doesn't require authorisation to view the users.json and milestones.json

board with id 813851 belongs to the gruop 3711406, which is private.

## Steps to reproduce

Make a group, set it to be private, and create a board, jot down the board id, and now you can view the member of the private group with these url

[https://gitlab.com/-/boards/{board\_id}/users.json](https://gitlab.com/-/boards/%7Bboard_id%7D/users.json)
[https://gitlab.com/-/boards/{board\_id}/milestones.json](https://gitlab.com/-/boards/%7Bboard_id%7D/milestones.json)

## Impact

easiest way to verify probably is to go <https://gitlab.com/-/boards/1/milestones.json> <https://gitlab.com/-/boards/1/users.json>

and keep increasing the ID of the board, and you will notice none of them require authorisation.

Just remember to login before you visit the url.
