Details:
The board endpoint does not require authorization to view the users.json and milestones.json files. This allows an authenticated user to view the member and milestone details of private groups by accessing the board endpoint.

PoC:
https://gitlab.com/-/boards/813851/users.json
https://gitlab.com/-/boards/813851/milestones.json

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a private group and a board within it.
2. Note the board ID.
3. As an authenticated user, visit the following URLs, replacing `{board_id}` with the actual ID:
  - https://gitlab.com/-/boards/{board_id}/users.json
  - https://gitlab.com/-/boards/{board_id}/milestones.json

Impact:
Disclosure of private group members and milestone details.

Attack vectors:
An authenticated user can access the `/users.json` and `/milestones.json` endpoints of any board, regardless of the group's privacy settings.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on GitLab.
