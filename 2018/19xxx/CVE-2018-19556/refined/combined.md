# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Detail: <https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/147063/Z-Blog-1.5.1.1740-Full-Path-Disclosure.html>

Duplicated with [CVE-2018-6846](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6ww6-frcj-4qm8 "CVE-2018-6846"). We fixed them after [CVE-2018-6846](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6ww6-frcj-4qm8 "CVE-2018-6846") confirmed. See: [7f09eb1](https://github.com/zblogcn/zblogphp/commit/7f09eb1d4eaf5e640a2bb07c9dcb97de77bd3c77)

### [CVE-2018-7736](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3qh5-grgw-6275 "CVE-2018-7736")

Author: @ponyma233

Detail: ~~<https://github.com/ponyma233/cms/blob/master/Z-Blog_1.5.1.1740_bugs.md>~~

Detail: <https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/147066/Z-Blog-1.5.1.1740-Cross-Site-Scripting.html>

As same as [CVE-2018-10680](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8xmp-wxjp-6hxw "CVE-2018-10680") and [CVE-2018-11208](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gm9r-74vm-63jm "CVE-2018-11208"). We decline to accept it as a valid issue. If you get the admin privilege, we have so many self-xss ways.

## Useless

### [CVE-2018-10680](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8xmp-wxjp-6hxw "CVE-2018-10680")

Author: [@Oran9e](https://github.com/Oran9e)

Detail: [#185](https://github.com/zblogcn/zblogphp/issues/185)

We declined to accept a self-xss with admin privilege.

### [CVE-2018-11208](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gm9r-74vm-63jm "CVE-2018-11208")

Author: [@Jayway007](https://github.com/Jayway007)

Detail: [#187](https://github.com/zblogcn/zblogphp/issues/187)

We declined to accept a self-xss with admin privilege.

## Fake

### [CVE-2018-19556](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gv3m-w682-jc3j "CVE-2018-19556")

Author: [@novysodope](https://github.com/novysodope)

Detail: <https://github.com/novysodope/Z-BlogPHP1.5Zero/commit/49b1b99d2df0fd2a3ae61655b516a1c6bc998b57>

It's Adobe's bug, not us. As him said, see [CVE-2017-1125](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c69g-rq53-jjpm "CVE-2017-1125") and [CVE-2018-4901](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f7cw-fqvv-747p "CVE-2018-4901").

### [CVE-2018-19463](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-87q4-fqr2-3wr2 "CVE-2018-19463")

Author: [@novysodope](https://github.com/novysodope)

Detail: <https://github.com/novysodope/Z-BlogPHP1.5Zero/commit/8526931c1e5fbe185740d91f9b286c38d3401445>

**It's fake**. We have no dynamic including. No one can run PHP by uploading an image in current version. By the way, it needs authentication.

### [CVE-2018-11209](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hvj4-mm2p-82f7 "CVE-2018-11209")

Author: [@Jayway007](https://github.com/Jayway007)

Detail: [#188](https://github.com/zblogcn/zblogphp/issues/188)

It's a joke. I laughed.
