Next, the attacker conducts a DoS attack against> the Z-Wave S0 Security version product by continuously sending divided> "Nonce Get (0x98 0x81)" frames. The reason for dividing> the "Nonce Get" frame is that, in security version S0, when a node> receives a "Nonce Get" frame, the node produces a random new nonce> and sends it to the Src node of the received "Nonce Get" frame. After the> nonce value is generated and transmitted, the node transitions to wait mode.> At this time, when "Nonce Get" is received again, the node discards> the previous nonce value and generates a random nonce again. Therefore,> because the frame is encrypted with previous nonce value, the received> normal frame cannot be decrypted.> > ------------------------------------------> > [Additional Information]> attacker and attack target must coexist within maximum 30 M> (Repeater function can make distance more further)> > ------------------------------------------> > [VulnerabilityType Other]> DoS> > ------------------------------------------> > [Vendor of Product]> Sigma Design> > ------------------------------------------> > [Affected Product Code Base]> Z Wave Products - S0 ~ S2> > ------------------------------------------> > [Affected Component]> Disable all the functions, by using encryption and merging function of the product which use Z-Wave's S0 or higher security module> > ------------------------------------------> > [Attack Type]> Local> > ------------------------------------------> > [Impact Denial of Service]> true> > ------------------------------------------> > [Attack Vectors]> By making a short "Nonce Get" frame longer and continuously sends a frame so that the service does not operate normally> > ------------------------------------------> > [Reference]> https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/z-wave> https://github.com/OpenZWave> https://github.com/genielabs/zwave-lib-dotnet> > ------------------------------------------> > [Discoverer]> WYP
