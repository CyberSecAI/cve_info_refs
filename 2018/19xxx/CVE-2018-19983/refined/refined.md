{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way Z-Wave S0 security devices handle 'Nonce Get' frames. When a node receives a 'Nonce Get' frame, it generates a new nonce and discards the previous one. By continuously sending divided 'Nonce Get' frames, an attacker can force the node to repeatedly generate new nonces, rendering previous frames undecryptable and causing denial of service.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of nonce values upon receiving repeated 'Nonce Get' frames.",
      "Lack of proper rate-limiting or validation for 'Nonce Get' frames."
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (DoS). The device becomes unable to process normal Z-Wave frames because they cannot be decrypted with the current nonce after a nonce reset.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack is carried out by continuously sending divided 'Nonce Get (0x98 0x81)' frames to the target device using a Z-Wave frame-transmission program (e.g., Z-Wave PC Controller, OpenZWave, CC1110). The attacker needs to be within a 30-meter range of the target, unless repeaters are used to extend the range.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires the capability to transmit Z-Wave frames. The attacker needs to have a device that can communicate with Z-wave devices, using programs like Z-Wave PC Controller, OpenZWave or similar tools. The attacker needs to be within the communication range or use repeaters."
