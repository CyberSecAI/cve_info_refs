Issue #960 identified that the buffer allocated for copying the

This commit changes the way the status code is read, avoids copying
data, and also ensures that the status code is three digits long,
is non-negative and occurs on the first line of the response.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c0)  Marcus RÃ¼ckert   2016-12-12 14:19:11 UTC  ``` I would like to enable dbus support in keepalived. which atm is blocked by the rpmlintrc check.  Code: <https://github.com/acassen/keepalived/>  Service file: <https://github.com/acassen/keepalived/blob/master/keepalived/dbus/org.keepalived.Vrrp1.conf>  any objections? ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c2)  Johannes Segitz   2017-03-30 14:34:37 UTC  ``` Making the bug private to the discuss the issues found.  1, Heap overflow when parsing HTTP responses  extract_status_code extracts the HTTP status codes from monitored servers.          /* Allocate the room */         buf_code = (char *)MALLOC(10);          /* Status-Code extraction */         while (buffer < end && *buffer++ != ' ') ;         begin = buffer;         while (buffer < end && *buffer++ != ' ')                 inc++;         strncat(buf_code, begin, inc);  So if the status code is longer then 9 bytes we run into a problem here.   *** Error in `/usr/sbin/keepalived': free(): invalid pointer: 0x00000000006a76c0 *** ======= Backtrace: =========

2](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c2) is not very promising.  Has this been fixed upstream, or reported to upstream at all?  Johannes, could you take care of this? Would be a shame to keep your finding a secret ;-)  Otherwise I think we can close the bug until we have a more robust version available that can be re-audited. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c5)  Johannes Segitz   2018-10-19 07:28:34 UTC  ``` (In reply to Matthias Gerstner from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c4)) shame on me. I sent this to upstream but didn't get a reaction. I'll try again with github issues and then we can close this ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c6)  Johannes Segitz   2018-10-24 14:07:01 UTC  ``` (In reply to Johannes Segitz from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c2)) The issue is fixed upstream in f28015671a4b04785859d1b4b1327b367b6a10e9 ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c7)  Johannes Segitz   2018-10-25 15:11:59 UTC  ``` I found two other issues. One isn't exploitable since it's caught by by dbus itself. The other is the ability to overwrite arbitrary files if  PrintData or PrintStats is invoked and fs.protected_symlinks=0 (default 1 for our products)  Reproducer:  user: johannes@linux-v0tl:~> ls -lah /passwd -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2.9K Oct 25 16:47 /passwd johannes@linux-v0tl:~> head -n 1 /passwd at:x:25:25:Batch jobs daemon:/var/spool/atjobs:/bin/bash johannes@linux-v0tl:~> ln -s /passwd /tmp/keepalived.data  root: # fs.protected_symlinks=0 # busctl call org.keepalived.Vrrp1 /org/keepalived/Vrrp1/Vrrp org.keepalived.Vrrp1.Vrrp  PrintData # head -n1 /passwd ------< Global definitions >------  /tmp/keepalived.data and /tmp/keepalived.stats is also created mode 666, so information can leak/be modified to/by unprivileged users. I'll create an upstream issue. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c8)  Johannes Segitz   2018-10-25 15:17:16 UTC  ``` Tracked in  <https://github.com/acassen/keepalived/issues/1048>  I would like to invest a little bit more time here (is also a good learning opportunity for dbus for me) ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c9)  Johannes Segitz   2018-10-26 08:23:57 UTC  ``` overall I'm not sure we want to enable this. There's not much defense in depth in there. E.g. set_valid_path in keepalived/vrrp/vrrp_dbus.c will happily overflow while creating a valid_path because it only checks that the input string still has characters, not if there's still space in the output buffer. Can't be exploited directly since handle_method_call checks the size, but it would be nice to have the check in the function that created the path, so it can't be forgotten if it's reused somewhere else. Lets see if I find more ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c10)  Johannes Segitz   2018-11-06 16:43:55 UTC  ``` (In reply to Johannes Segitz from [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c8)) The issue was fixed upstream and I'll request a CVE id for it  @Darix: So with that I would be willing to whitelist this if you still need the functionality. Is this the case? ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c11)  Marcus RÃ¼ckert   2018-11-07 13:50:24 UTC  ``` Yes please ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c12)  Johannes Segitz   2018-11-08 08:03:31 UTC  ``` (In reply to Johannes Segitz from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c7)) I asked MITRE for a CVE and they assigned three: CVE-2018-19044 for <https://github.com/acassen/keepalived/commit/04f2d32871bb3b11d7dc024039952f2fe2750306> CVE-2018-19045 for <https://github.com/acassen/keepalived/commit/c6247a9ef2c7b33244ab1d3aa5d629ec49f0a067>, <https://github.com/acassen/keepalived/commit/5241e4d7b177d0b6f073cfc9ed5444bf51ec89d6> CVE-2018-19046 for the case, that a user already created /tmp/keepalived.data or /tmp/keepalived.stats with mode 666, so it's not covered by the umask fix and should still be fixed ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c13)  Johannes Segitz   2018-11-08 08:29:54 UTC  ``` Once the issues are fixed I'll add the whitelist entry for the dbus service ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c14)  Johannes Segitz   2018-11-08 10:22:45 UTC  ``` making public so it can be used as CVE reference ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c15)  Swamp Workflow Management   2018-11-08 15:50:05 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1015141) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/647347> Factory / rpmlint ``` [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c16)  Johannes Segitz   2018-11-09 07:36:46 UTC  ``` (In reply to Johannes Segitz from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c6)) This was assigned CVE-2018-19115. ``` [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c17)  Johannes Segitz   2018-11-12 16:25:48 UTC  ``` (In reply to Johannes Segitz from [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c12)) CVE-2018-19046 is fixed by ac8e2ef, 26c8d63 and 17f9441 ``` [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c18)  Marcus Meissner   2018-11-12 19:03:01 UTC  ``` what files can you modified that are mode 666>?   what can be doen with the content? ``` [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c19)  Johannes Segitz   2018-11-13 07:45:24 UTC  ``` (In reply to Marcus Meissner from [comment #18](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c18)) /tmp/keepalived.data or /tmp/keepalived.stats could have been created with e.g. mode 666, so the umask fix doesn't work.

## Topic

An update for keepalived is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The keepalived utility provides simple and robust facilities for load balancing and high availability. The load balancing framework relies on the well-known and widely used IP Virtual Server (IPVS) kernel module providing layer-4 (transport layer) load balancing. Keepalived implements a set of checkers to dynamically and adaptively maintain and manage a load balanced server pool according to the health of the servers. Keepalived also implements the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRPv2) to achieve high availability with director failover.

Security Fix(es):

* keepalived: Heap-based buffer overflow when parsing HTTP status codes allows for denial of service or possibly arbitrary code execution (CVE-2018-19115)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA512

Package        : icecast2
Version        : 1:1.2.13-1+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-19115
Debian Bug     : 914393

keepalived has a heap-based buffer overflow when parsing HTTP status
codes resulting in DoS or possibly unspecified other impact, because
extract_status_code in lib/html.c has no validation of the status code
and instead writes an unlimited amount of data to the heap.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
1:1.2.13-1+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your keepalived packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

## Topic

An update for keepalived is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5 Extended Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The keepalived utility provides simple and robust facilities for load balancing and high availability. The load balancing framework relies on the well-known and widely used IP Virtual Server (IPVS) kernel module providing layer-4 (transport layer) load balancing. Keepalived implements a set of checkers to dynamically and adaptively maintain and manage a load balanced server pool according to the health of the servers. Keepalived also implements the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRPv2) to achieve high availability with director failover.

Security Fix(es):

* keepalived: Heap-based buffer overflow when parsing HTTP status codes allows for denial of service or possibly arbitrary code execution (CVE-2018-19115)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

## Description

keepalived before 2.0.7 has a heap-based buffer overflow when parsing HTTP status codes resulting in DoS or possibly unspecified other impact, because extract\_status\_code in lib/html.c has no validation of the status code and instead writes an unlimited amount of data to the heap.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other usersâ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a programâs source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hatâs CVE database.

When a technologyâenabled and most likely used by defaultâcompletely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-trackingÂ  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.Â  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.Â  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.Â  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.Â  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.Â  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Fix buffer overflow in extract\_status\_code()

```
Issue [#960](https://github.com/acassen/keepalived/issues/960) identified that the buffer allocated for copying the
HTTP status code could overflow if the http response was corrupted.

This commit changes the way the status code is read, avoids copying
data, and also ensures that the status code is three digits long,
is non-negative and occurs on the first line of the response.

## Topic

An update for keepalived is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 Extended Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The keepalived utility provides simple and robust facilities for load balancing and high availability. The load balancing framework relies on the well-known and widely used IP Virtual Server (IPVS) kernel module providing layer-4 (transport layer) load balancing. Keepalived implements a set of checkers to dynamically and adaptively maintain and manage a load balanced server pool according to the health of the servers. Keepalived also implements the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRPv2) to achieve high availability with director failover.

Security Fix(es):

* keepalived: Heap-based buffer overflow when parsing HTTP status codes allows for denial of service or possibly arbitrary code execution (CVE-2018-19115)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.
