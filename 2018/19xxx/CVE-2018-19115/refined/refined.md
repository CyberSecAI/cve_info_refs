Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-19115:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a heap-based buffer overflow in the `extract_status_code()` function within the `lib/html.c` file of Keepalived. This function is responsible for parsing HTTP status codes from server responses.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** The `extract_status_code()` function allocates a fixed-size buffer on the heap (10 bytes) to store the extracted status code. However, the function doesn't properly validate the length of the status code received in the HTTP response. If a response with a status code longer than 9 bytes is encountered, the function writes beyond the allocated buffer, causing a heap overflow.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The code does not validate the size or format of the HTTP status code before copying it into the buffer, which leads to the overflow.
*   **Unbounded Copying:** `strncat` is used without ensuring the destination buffer has enough capacity for the data being copied

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service. By sending a specially crafted HTTP response with an excessively long status code, a remote attacker can cause Keepalived to crash.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** The vulnerability has the *potential* for arbitrary code execution although it is not confirmed. Overwriting heap memory can potentially corrupt data structures or function pointers, which may lead to arbitrary code execution under certain conditions, but this is not a guaranteed or confirmed impact.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network.
*   **Specially Crafted Network Traffic:** The attacker must send a specially crafted HTTP response with a manipulated status code to trigger the overflow. This is typically achieved by making the status code in the response larger than the allocated buffer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Keepalived instance.
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Traffic:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a web server that is monitored by the vulnerable Keepalived instance, allowing them to control the HTTP response containing the malicious status code.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Keepalived versions prior to 2.0.7.
*   Patches have been made available by various vendors (Red Hat, Ubuntu, Debian) to address this issue.
*   The fix involves avoiding copying of status code by parsing it directly as a string.
* The vulnerability is in `lib/html.c` file within the `extract_status_code()` function.
* The vulnerability was identified in the context of dbus support being enabled for keepalived.
