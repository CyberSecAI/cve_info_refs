The provided document is a changelog for Centreon Web 18.10.0 and includes a section detailing security fixes. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is not specifically detailed for each fix, but the changelog mentions several XSS and SQL injection vulnerabilities. It generally points to improper input sanitization, or inadequate escaping of user-supplied data when displayed or used in database queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple XSS vulnerabilities were present across various parts of the application, including:
    - ACL list page
    - Administration pages
    - Host list page
    - Adding poller macros
    - Host, service, & downtime comments
    - General application
    - Monitoring pages
    - ACL Access Groups
- **SQL Injection:** SQL injection vulnerabilities were found in:
    - SNMP trap editing
    - Virtual metric functionality

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **XSS:** Successful exploitation of XSS vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web application, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the application
    - Stealing sensitive information
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
- **SQL Injection:** SQL Injection could allow an attacker to:
    - Read sensitive data from the database
    - Modify or delete data
    - Potentially gain unauthorized access to the system or underlying OS if the database user has such permissions

**Attack vectors:**
- **XSS:** Attackers could inject malicious scripts through various user input fields, such as comments, descriptions, or configuration settings within the Centreon interface.
- **SQL Injection:** Attackers could exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities by crafting malicious inputs in specific areas of the application, like SNMP trap editing and virtual metrics.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attackers would need to be authenticated users of the Centreon platform or have the ability to provide malicious inputs that are not sanitized.
- Attackers would need to be able to access and manipulate the vulnerable parts of the web application.

**Additional notes:**
- The changelog also mentions the introduction of a new escape method to fix XSS issues (commit 5820a04), which suggests an effort to address these vulnerabilities systematically.
- The fixes are implemented through pull requests (PRs), implying the use of version control and a structured development process.
