Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-19840:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `WavpackPackInit` function within `pack_utils.c`. A crafted WAV audio file with a sample rate of zero causes an infinite loop due to a mishandling by `WavpackSetConfiguration64`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Infinite loop:** The core weakness is the program's inability to handle a zero sample rate, leading to a resource exhaustion condition.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The infinite loop consumes system resources, effectively causing a DoS by making the application unresponsive.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A successful attack results in a denial-of-service. The application becomes unresponsive due to the infinite loop, preventing legitimate users from processing audio files.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a maliciously crafted WAV audio file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs the ability to provide the targeted system with a malicious audio file.
*   No special privileges are required on the system. The attack can likely be initiated by an unprivileged user.
*   User interaction is required, as a user must attempt to process the malicious file using the vulnerable software.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content identifies the specific code location `pack_utils.c` where `WavpackPackInit` function has the vulnerability,  and it also names the function `WavpackSetConfiguration64` as source of the problem.

Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-19841:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the `WavpackVerifySingleBlock` function in `open_utils.c`. A specifically crafted WavPack Lossless Audio file triggers an out-of-bounds read, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** The vulnerability stems from an incorrect boundary check which leads to accessing memory beyond the allocated buffer.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The out-of-bounds read results in an application crash, causing a DoS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Exploitation results in a denial-of-service due to an application crash, rendering the targeted system unable to process audio files.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a malicious WavPack Lossless Audio file that triggers the vulnerability when processed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs the ability to provide the target system with a crafted audio file.
*   No special privileges are required; the attack can likely be initiated by an unprivileged user.
*   User interaction is needed, as a user must attempt to process the malicious file using the vulnerable software.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content specifies that `WavpackVerifySingleBlock` is located in `open_utils.c`. It also indicates that wvunpack is one way to trigger the bug.

Here is a combined summary of both vulnerabilities:

*   Both vulnerabilities are present in the `wavpack` library which is used to handle the encoding and decoding of WavPack audio files.
*   Both of them can be triggered via malicious audio files, with sample rate zero (CVE-2018-19840) or specially crafted data (CVE-2018-19841) causing denial-of-service conditions.
*   Both of them were fixed on version 5.2.0 and later.
