**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input within the "Title" field of Bolt CMS when previewing a page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Specifically, the vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The provided exploit demonstrates how to inject malicious JavaScript code into the "Title" field, which is then executed in the victim's browser when previewing the page.
