The provided content is related to CVE-2018-19029.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by an untrusted pointer dereference within the LAquis SCADA software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Untrusted Pointer Dereference (CWE-822). The software does not properly validate a memory address provided by an attacker.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or a system crash.

**Attack vectors:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by using a specially crafted project file containing a malicious memory address.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted project file to the affected software. This can be done remotely since the vulnerability is remotely exploitable. The attacker does not require special privileges or user interaction, however, must have a low skill level to exploit.
