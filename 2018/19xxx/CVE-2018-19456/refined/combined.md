| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1110949#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2018-10-05 17:28:59 UTC  ``` Git 2.14.5, 2.15.3, 2.16.5, 2.17.2, 2.18.1, and 2.19.1  These releases fix a security flaw (CVE-2018-17456), which allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary code by crafting a malicious .gitmodules file in a project cloned with --recurse-submodules.  When running "git clone --recurse-submodules", Git parses the supplied .gitmodules file for a URL field and blindly passes it as an argument to a "git clone" subprocess.  If the URL field is set to a string that begins with a dash, this "git clone" subprocess interprets the URL as an option.  This can lead to executing an arbitrary script shipped in the superproject as the user who ran "git clone".  In addition to fixing the security issue for the user running "clone", the 2.17.2, 2.18.1 and 2.19.1 releases have an "fsck" check which can be used to detect such malicious repository content when fetching or accepting a push. See "transfer.fsckObjects" in git-config(1).  Credit for finding and fixing this vulnerability goes to joernchen and Jeff King, respectively.

The relevant code in SUSE:SLE-11-SP1:Update/git has changed quite a bit. This functionality has been rewritten in C (was shell script previously), starting with commit ee8838d157. The functionality was already available back then, but I'm not sure whether it was vulnerable to this sort of attack. Needs further analysis. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1110949#c5)  Takashi Iwai   2018-10-08 14:44:53 UTC  ``` Also Leap 42.3 has its own version (2.13.7-based). ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1110949#c6)  Swamp Workflow Management   2018-10-08 15:40:05 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1110949) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/640652> 42.3 / git ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1110949#c8)  Takashi Iwai   2018-10-09 12:30:06 UTC  ``` Now backported to SLE15 and Leap42.3.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1114729#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2018-11-05 16:19:09 UTC  ``` From <https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/releases/tag/v0.27.6> <https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/releases/tag/v0.26.8>  This as a security release fixing the following list of issues:      The function family git__strtol is used to parse integers     from a buffer. As the functions do not take a buffer length as     argument, they will scan either until the end of the current     number or until a NUL byte is encountered. Many callers have     been misusing the function and called it on potentially     non-NUL-terminated buffers, resulting in possible out-of-bounds     reads. Callers have been fixed to use git__strntol functions     instead and git__strtol functions were removed.      The function git__strntol64 relied on the undefined behavior     of signed integer overflows. While the code tried to detect     such overflows after they have happened, this is unspecified     behavior and may lead to weird behavior on uncommon platforms.      In the case where git__strntol32 was unable to parse an     integer because it doesn't fit into an int32_t, it printed an     error message containing the string that is currently being     parsed. The code didn't truncate the string though, which     caused it to print the complete string until a NUL byte is     encountered and not only the currently parsed number. In case     where the string was not NUL terminated, this could have lead     to an out-of-bounds read.      When parsing tags, all unknown fields that appear before the     tag message are skipped. This skipping is done by using a plain     strstr(buffer, "\n\n") to search for the two newlines that     separate tag fields from tag message. As it is not possible to     supply a buffer length to strstr, this call may skip over the     buffer's end and thus result in an out of bounds read. As     strstr may return a pointer that is out of bounds, the     following computation of buffer_end - buffer will overflow     and result in an allocation of an invalid length. Note that     when reading objects from the object database, we make sure to     always NUL terminate them, making the use of strstr safe.      When parsing the "encoding" field of a commit, we may perform     an out of bounds read due to using git__prefixcmp instead of     git__prefixncmp. This can result in the parsed commit object     containing uninitialized data in both its message encoding and     message fields. Note that when reading objects from the object     database, we make sure to always NUL terminate them, making the     use of strstr safe. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1114729#c2)  Swamp Workflow Management   2018-12-07 14:10:54 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2018:4009-1: An update that solves one vulnerability and has one errata is now available.
