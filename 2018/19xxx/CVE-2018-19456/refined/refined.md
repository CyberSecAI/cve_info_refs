Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-19456:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how the WP Backup+ plugin for WordPress handles file downloads. Specifically, it does not properly sanitize user input, allowing for the retrieval of sensitive files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Disclosure**: The primary weakness is the plugin's failure to restrict access to server files and directories. By manipulating the request, attackers can potentially access and download sensitive server files like `download.sql`.
- **Arbitrary code execution**: Git and libgit2 also had a vulnerability where a specially crafted .gitmodules file could lead to arbitrary code execution when cloning a repository with submodules. This occurs when the URL field of a submodule in the `.gitmodules` file starts with a dash, which is then interpreted by the `git clone` subprocess as an option instead of a URL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Leakage**: Attackers can gain access to sensitive information, such as database backups, potentially exposing usernames, passwords, and other confidential data.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Through the use of a malicious `.gitmodules` file, arbitrary code can be executed on the victim's machine when cloning a repository, allowing an attacker to gain further control of the victim machine.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation**: Attackers can craft malicious HTTP requests targeting the vulnerable download functionality of the plugin. This likely involves manipulating parameters to point to sensitive server files.
- **Malicious .gitmodules:** An attacker can create a malicious `.gitmodules` file with a specially crafted URL starting with a dash. When a user clones the repository with the malicious .gitmodules, the `git clone` subprocess will interpret the URL as a command-line option and may execute arbitrary code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable WordPress installation or provide the malicious repository to a victim.
- **Basic knowledge of HTTP requests and WordPress plugin structure**: The attacker needs to have some understanding of HTTP requests to exploit the WP Backup+ plugin. The attacker also needs to understand git and how it handles submodules to exploit the `git` vulnerability.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided information indicates that SUSE products were not directly affected by the WP Backup+ vulnerability itself.
- However, SUSE products were affected by a related `git` and `libgit2` vulnerability, CVE-2018-17456, which was fixed in the provided updates.
-  The fix for the `git` vulnerability involved sanitizing the input to prevent it from being misinterpreted as a command-line option.
-  The fix for `libgit2` involved ignoring submodule URLs and paths that start with a dash.

The information available is more detailed than the initial CVE description, providing specific examples, affected components (e.g. git, libgit2) and mitigation strategies implemented.
