This document provides a security update log for various Evernote products. While the document doesn't mention CVE-2018-19658 directly, it does contain information on multiple security issues that were fixed across different Evernote applications and platforms.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant vulnerabilities mentioned:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** This is the most frequently mentioned vulnerability, impacting various components:
    *   Markdown rendering in Mac and Windows versions. (MAC-832, WEBFRONT-4479, WINDOWS-684)
    *   Rendering of attachment filenames in Windows. (WWINNOTE-19568, WINNOTE-19620)
    *   Google Drive integration in Windows and Android versions (WINNOTE-15870, DRDNOTE-23054)
    *   Related search results in Chrome and Safari Clipper extensions. (CC-1693, SAFARICLIP-992)
    *   Activity view and other web views in Windows. (WINNOTE-13340, WINNOTE-13475, WINNOTE-13472)
    *   Related Context feature in Windows. (CE-735)
    *   Clipping from malicious sites in Chrome Clipper. (CC-2561)
*   **HTML Injection:** A potential issue in the Chrome Clipper's login page. (CC-1729)
*   **Authentication Token Transmission over HTTP:** In specific Windows versions (6.4-6.7), authentication tokens were sent over HTTP instead of HTTPS, but note content, usernames, and passwords were encrypted during transit. (WINNOTE-19299)
*   **DLL Hijacking/Preloading:** Vulnerabilities found in the Windows installer and binaries. (WINNOTE-15637, WINNOTE-8970)
*   **Local Data Deletion Issue:** When local folder configuration changed, data was not deleted in older Windows versions. (WINNOTE-14610)
*   **File:// URI Handling:** Lack of prompts before opening files using `file://` URIs on macOS (MACOSNOTE-12400)
*   **Cross-Application IPC Channel:** Insecure NSConnection usage on macOS (MACOSNOTE-18729)
*  **PIN Lock Bypass:** Issues found in iOS, Android and Blackberry versions. (IOSNOTE-28074, DRDNOTE-20794,DRDNOTE-22660, EFB-1836)
*  **PIN Lock Bruteforcing:** Issue found on Android version. (DRDNOTE-24142)
*   **Keychain Items Accessibility:** Insecure keychain attributes in iTunes/iCloud backups. (IOSNOTE-22342)
*   **Same-Origin Policy Bypass:** WebViews using `file://` URLs in iOS. (IOSNOTE-19688, CP-3280)
*  **SSL Certificate Error Ignored:** Some webviews ignoring SSL certificate errors on debug/internal builds (DRDNOTE-20842)
*   **SDWebImage Library Vulnerability:** Outdated library used in iOS and iOS Food app. (IOSNOTE-19338, IOSFOOD-4320)
*   **Adonit SDK Vulnerability:** Fetching content over HTTP instead of HTTPS on iOS Penultimate. (IOSPENULT-4056)
*   **Local File Opening:** Lack of warning when opening local files in Windows. (WINNOTE-8997)
*   **SD Card Note Storage:** Notes stored in the SD card instead of internal memory on Android. (DRDNOTE-9500, DRDNOTE-11183)

**Root Cause:**

*   Improper sanitization of user-supplied data (XSS).
*   Insecure handling of file URIs.
*   Vulnerabilities in third party libraries.
*   Lack of proper input validation.
*   Insecure communication protocols.
*   Weak access controls for sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** Could lead to session hijacking, stealing sensitive information, or defacing the user interface.
*   **HTML Injection:** Could allow an attacker to inject malicious HTML content.
*   **Authentication Token Transmission over HTTP:** Exposure of authentication tokens, though note content was encrypted.
*   **DLL Hijacking:** Could enable arbitrary code execution.
*   **PIN Lock Bypass/Bruteforcing:** Unauthorized access to notes.
*   **File URI handling:** Could potentially lead to arbitrary file access.
*   **Insecure IPC Channel:** Could lead to privilege escalation or cross-application compromise.
*   **SSL certificate errors:** Could lead to man-in-the-middle attacks

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Malicious Markdown content in notes.
*   Manipulated file names in attachments.
*   Exploiting Google Drive integration.
*   Malicious websites during web clipping.
*   Exploiting the extensionâ€™s login page.
*   Man-in-the-middle attacks for HTTP token transmission.
*   Local file system access for DLL hijacking.
*   Physical access or malware for brute force PIN attempts
*   Manipulated file uris
*   Network attacks or malicious debug/internal builds

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Ability to create or inject malicious content into the note taking application.
*   Ability to intercept network traffic.
*   Local access for some DLL hijacking vulnerabilities.
*   Physical access or malware for brute force PIN attempts

**Additional Information:**
The document specifies the versions of Evernote products where each vulnerability has been fixed. It also indicates the end-of-support dates for certain products, which means they will not receive further security updates.

**Relevance to CVE-2018-19658:**
