Root cause of vulnerability:
The `CollectiveWorkOrderCost.php` script in webERP version 4.15 is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of the `SearchParts` parameter.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- SQL Injection vulnerability in the `SearchParts` parameter.

Impact of exploitation:
- Attackers can potentially extract sensitive information such as database version, database user, or potentially other data.

Attack vectors:
- The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP request to the `CollectiveWorkOrderCost.php` page with a malicious SQL injection payload within the `SearchParts` parameter.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to access the webERP application through the network and be able to send HTTP requests. An authenticated user is required to reach the vulnerable page.
