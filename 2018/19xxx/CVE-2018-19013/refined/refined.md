Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2018-19013:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by the **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')**. Specifically, the application fails to properly sanitize commands within a project file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection (CWE-77):** The software allows an attacker to inject commands into a specially crafted project file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could inject commands to delete files and/or delete the contents of a file on the device.
*   Successful exploitation could result in a **loss of integrity** (file deletion) and **denial of service**.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attack vector is local (AV:L). The attacker must have access to the system where the vulnerable software is running.
*   **Crafted Project File:** The attacker must craft a malicious project file containing injected commands.
*   **User Interaction:** User interaction is required (UI:R), as a user must open the crafted project file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low privileges:** The attacker needs low privileges on the system (PR:L).
*   **Local access:** The attacker requires local access to the affected machine.
*   **Requires User Action:** The attacker must convince a user to open a malicious project file.
*   **Complexity:** The attack complexity is high (AC:H).

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in **Omron CX-Supervisor versions 3.42 and prior.**
*   A CVSS v3 base score of **5.0** has been assigned to the vulnerability, with a vector string of **AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H**
*   The report mentions that a successful exploit of this vulnerability could result in a denial-of-service condition, and/or allow an attacker to achieve code execution with privileges within the context of the application. However, this specific CVE only relates to the described command injection vulnerability of deleting files/content.
*   The vendor has released a fix in version 3.5.0.11, recommending that projects are upgraded, saved in the new format, and rebuilt in this latest version.
