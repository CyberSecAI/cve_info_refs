- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper Input Validation
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The affected EtherNet/IP web server modules do not properly validate input to the SNMP service.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can send a crafted UDP packet to the SNMP service, causing a denial-of-service condition that persists until the device is restarted. This denies communication with the SNMP service.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can send a crafted UDP packet.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the affected device. Low skill level is required to exploit this vulnerability.
