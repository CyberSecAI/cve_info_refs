Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input (`$keyword`) when constructing an SQL query. Specifically, the `$keyword` variable is directly embedded into the SQL `LIKE` clause without any escaping or filtering.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By injecting specially crafted SQL fragments within the `$keyword` parameter, an attacker can manipulate the database query, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or modifying database content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Disclosure:** Attackers can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, which can include user credentials, personal information, and other confidential data.
*   **Data Modification:** Attackers can alter the database content, potentially inserting malicious records, modifying existing data, or deleting information.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, successful SQL injection can grant attackers elevated privileges within the database.
*   **Denial of Service:** Attackers could potentially disrupt the application's database connectivity, causing it to become unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET/POST Request:** The attack vector involves exploiting the `search.php` page of the S-CMS application through a specially crafted HTTP request that includes the malicious SQL injection payload within the `keyword` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable S-CMS application.
*   **Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to be familiar with SQL syntax and injection techniques to craft effective attack payloads.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Code Location:** `S-CMS/search.php` line 155
*   **Vulnerable Code Snippet:**
    ```php
    $sql="select * from SL_text where(T_title like '%".$keyword."%' or T_content like '%".$keyword."%' ) order by T_id desc";
    ```
*   **Exploit Example:**
    *   `%' AND 1=1 AND '%'='`
    *    `%' AND 1=2 AND '%'='`
    These examples illustrate the basic idea of injecting additional SQL conditions that are always true and always false respectively. More complex SQL injection payloads can be used to extract or modify the database content.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided content contains proof-of-concept exploit attempts that show how an attacker can verify the presence of the SQL injection vulnerability.
* The blog post also links to a download page for the vulnerable S-CMS software.

**In Summary:**

The content accurately describes a SQL injection vulnerability in S-CMS. The vulnerability is located in the `search.php` file where user-provided input is not sanitized before being used in an SQL query. An attacker could exploit this to gain unauthorized access to the underlying database.
