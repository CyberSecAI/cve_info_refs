    - **Root Cause:** Hard-coded passwords used for FTP, configuration file decryption and factory access.
    - **Weaknesses:**  Use of hard-coded passwords, lack of secure password generation/storage
    - **Impact:** Unauthorized access and device compromise.
    - **Attack Vectors:** Exploiting FTP, accessing backup files, and using hidden factory credentials.
    - **Required Capabilities:** Network access or ability to access device configuration files.

**3. Hidden Functionality: telnetd Switch:** (CVE-2018-19068)
    - **Root Cause:** Hidden HTTP requests allow enabling/disabling the telnet service.
    - **Weaknesses:**  Unnecessary hidden functionality; lack of proper access control.
    - **Impact:** Remote enabling of telnetd allows for more exploitation vectors.
    - **Attack Vectors:**  Sending specific HTTP requests.
    - **Required Capabilities:** Network access or knowledge of the hidden functionality.

**4. Remote Command Injection in User Add:** (CVE-2018-19070)
    - **Root Cause:**  The `usrName` parameter in the `addAccount` functionality is used in a command line executed by the shell without sanitization.
    - **Weaknesses:**  Command injection vulnerability.
    - **Impact:** Unauthenticated remote command execution as root.
    - **Attack Vectors:**  Sending a crafted HTTP request to the CGIProxy.
    - **Required Capabilities:** Network access to the device's web interface and knowledge of the vulnerability.

**5. Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resources:** (CVE-2018-19071, CVE-2018-19072)
    - **Root Cause:**  The `/mnt/mtd/boot.sh` script and the `/mnt/mtd/app` directory are world-writable.
    - **Weaknesses:** Insecure file/directory permissions.
    - **Impact:** Persistent compromise by modifying boot scripts or replacing software archives.
    - **Attack Vectors:** Modifying the vulnerable resources directly on the device.
    - **Required Capabilities:** Local access to the device.

**6. Remote Command Injection in `/mnt/mtd/boot.sh` via `ProductConfig.xml`:** (CVE-2018-19073)
     - **Root Cause:** The `modelName` from `ProductConfig.xml` is used in an `eval` statement in `/mnt/mtd/boot.sh` without sanitization.
     - **Weaknesses:** Command injection vulnerability due to use of `eval` on untrusted input.
     - **Impact:** Remote command execution as root
     - **Attack Vectors:** Injecting shell meta-characters into modelName in a crafted `ProductConfig.xml` file, and then restore it on the device.
     - **Required Capabilities:** Valid administrative credentials and network access.

**7. Improper Access Control: Firewall:** (CVE-2018-19074, CVE-2018-19075)
    - **Root Cause:** The firewall only protects the web interface, other services are still accessible. Additionally, firewall responses disclose credential validity.
    - **Weaknesses:** Inadequate firewall implementation, information disclosure
    - **Impact:** The firewall bypass allows for exploitation of other vulnerabilities. Information about valid credentials can be gleaned.
    - **Attack Vectors:**  Network access to the device.
    - **Required Capabilities:** Network access.

**8. Missing Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts:** (CVE-2018-19076)
    - **Root Cause:** The device lacks proper brute-force protection for the FTP and RTSP services.
    - **Weaknesses:**  Lack of rate limiting or account lockout mechanisms.
    - **Impact:** Allows brute force attacks against user credentials.
    - **Attack Vectors:**  Network access to the device's FTP or RTSP services.
    - **Required Capabilities:** Network access.

**9. Denial of Service of the RTSP video feed:** (CVE-2018-19077)
    - **Root Cause:** Improper processing of negative `Content-Length` values in the RTSP service.
    - **Weaknesses:**  Input validation issue in RTSP service.
    - **Impact:** Denial of service by crashing or freezing the video feed, requiring a device reboot.
    - **Attack Vectors:** Sending a crafted RTSP request.
    - **Required Capabilities:** Network access to the device's RTSP service.

**10. Administrator Credential Disclosure via Anonymous ONVIF GetStreamUri:** (CVE-2018-19078)
    - **Root Cause:** Anonymous access allowed to the ONVIF service, specifically the `GetStreamUri` method exposes admin username/password in the RTSP URI.
    - **Weaknesses:**  Lack of authentication in the ONVIF implementation.
    - **Impact:** Credential disclosure.
    - **Attack Vectors:** Accessing ONVIF through a specific method.
    - **Required Capabilities:** Network access to the device's ONVIF service.

**11. Unauthenticated Reboot via Anonymous ONVIF SystemReboot:** (CVE-2018-19079)
    - **Root Cause:**  Anonymous access to the ONVIF `SystemReboot` method.
    - **Weaknesses:** Lack of authentication in the ONVIF implementation.
    - **Impact:** Remote unauthenticated reboot.
    - **Attack Vectors:** Accessing ONVIF through a specific method.
    - **Required Capabilities:** Network access to the device's ONVIF service.

**12. Unauthenticated Persistent XSS via Anonymous ONVIF SetHostname:** (CVE-2018-19080)
    - **Root Cause:**  Anonymous access to the ONVIF `SetHostname` method allows injecting a persistent XSS payload.
    - **Weaknesses:**  Lack of authentication, improper input sanitization.
    - **Impact:** Persistent XSS attack targeting web interface users.
    - **Attack Vectors:** Accessing ONVIF through a specific method.
    - **Required Capabilities:** Network access to the device's ONVIF service.

**13. Unauthenticated Remote Command Injection via Anonymous ONVIF SetDNS:** (CVE-2018-19081)
    - **Root Cause:** Anonymous access to the ONVIF `SetDNS` method allows injecting a command into the DNS server IP address field, which is then executed as root.
    - **Weaknesses:**  Lack of authentication, command injection vulnerability.
    - **Impact:** Remote unauthenticated command execution as root.
    - **Attack Vectors:**  Accessing ONVIF through a specific method.
    - **Required Capabilities:** Network access to the device's ONVIF service.

**14. Stack-based Buffer Overflow in ONVIF SetDNS:** (CVE-2018-19082)
    - **Root Cause:**  The `SetDNS` method in ONVIF has a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in handling the `IPv4Address` parameter.
    - **Weaknesses:** Stack-based buffer overflow.
    - **Impact:** Remote denial of service and potential for code execution.
    - **Attack Vectors:** Sending a crafted ONVIF SetDNS request with an overly long IPv4 address.
