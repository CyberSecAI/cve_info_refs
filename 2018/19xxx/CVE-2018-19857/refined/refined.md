  "cve": "CVE-2018-19857",
  "description": "The CAF demuxer in modules/demux/caf.c in VideoLAN VLC media player 3.0.4 may read memory from an uninitialized pointer when processing magic cookies in CAF files, because a ReadKukiChunk() cast converts a return value to an unsigned int even if that value is negative. This could result in a denial of service and/or a potential infoleak.",
  "affected_software": {
    "name": "VLC media player",
    "versions": [
      "3.0.4",
      "prior to commit 0cc5ea748ee5ff7705dde61ab15dff8f58be39d0 in the master branch"
    ]
  },
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Integer underflow due to type casting",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uninitialized memory read",
      "Type casting of a negative return value to unsigned int",
      "Lack of proper error handling after memory allocation failure"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (crash) and/or potential information leak",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Maliciously crafted CAF file"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
        "Ability to provide a specially crafted CAF file to the target user"
    ]
  },
  "additional_details": [
   "The vulnerability exists within the ReadKukiChunk function of the CAF demuxer.",
   "When vlc_stream_Peek() fails to allocate memory, it returns VLC_ENOMEM (-2).",
   "This negative value is cast to unsigned int, thus circumventing the error check.",
   "The uninitialized pointer `p_peek` is then used to copy data which results in a crash or an information leak.",
    "The vulnerability can be triggered through a specially crafted CAF file, where the mChunkSize value in the kuki chunk header is set to a large number that will cause the allocation to fail in vlc_stream_peek()"
    ]
