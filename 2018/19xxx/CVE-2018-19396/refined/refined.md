Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-19396:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how PHP's serialization and unserialization functions handle COM objects. Specifically, the `com_properties_get` function within the `ext/com_dotnet/com_handlers.c` file always returns NULL. When the `serialize` function attempts to get the properties of a COM object, it uses `zend_get_properties_for`, which then leads to `zend_array_count` being called on a NULL pointer causing a crash. The unserialize function has a similar issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The core weakness is the lack of a null check before calling `zend_array_count` on the result of `zend_get_properties_for` when handling COM objects during serialization, which leads to a crash. A similar issue exists when unserializing.
*   **Incorrect COM Object Handling:** The `com_properties_get` function always returns NULL, which causes issues with serialization/unserialization process.
*   **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The serialize/unserialize functions do not properly validate the properties of the object being processed, leading to the crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a crash of the PHP process, resulting in a denial of service. This is because a crafted serialized or unserialized object can trigger the null pointer dereference, causing the program to terminate unexpectedly.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Serialization:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by serializing a PHP object of type `com`, `variant`, or `dotnet` and processing it with vulnerable PHP versions.
*   **Unserialization:** An attacker can also trigger the vulnerability by crafting a malicious serialized string representing a `com`, `variant`, or `dotnet` object and unserializing it with vulnerable PHP versions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to trigger serialization:** The attacker needs to be able to trigger the serialization of a COM, variant or dotnet object within a PHP application.
*   **Ability to trigger unserialization:** The attacker needs to be able to control the input to an `unserialize` function, providing a crafted string of a serialized `com`, `variant` or `dotnet` object.
*   **Access to a vulnerable system:** The attacker needs to target a system that is running a vulnerable version of PHP (5.x through 7.1.24) and has the COM/dotnet extension enabled.

**Additional Notes:**
* The bug report indicates that this affects PHP 5.0RC1 to the master branch, indicating its presence in various PHP versions.
* The bug was fixed in the PHP source code. Patches were submitted and a pull request was merged.
