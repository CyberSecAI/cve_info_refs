{
  "CVE-2018-19854": {
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel in the crypto_report_one() and related functions in the crypto/crypto_user.c (the crypto user configuration API) which do not fully initialize structures that are copied to userspace, potentially leaking sensitive kernel memory content to a userspace.",
    "Root cause": "The crypto_report_one() and related functions in crypto/crypto_user.c do not fully initialize structures before copying them to userspace.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Information Disclosure",
      "Use of uninitialized memory"
    ],
    "Impact": "Sensitive kernel memory content can be leaked to userspace.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Local attacker with ability to interact with the crypto user configuration API."
