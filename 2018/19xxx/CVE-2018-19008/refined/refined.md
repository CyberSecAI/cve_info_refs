Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-19008:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability lies in the file parser of the Text Editor application within the ABB CP400 Panel Builder software. The application fails to properly validate input, allowing the insertion of specially crafted files. This is due to improper input validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The application does not adequately check or sanitize input files, leading to the possibility of malicious file injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could enable an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system running the vulnerable Text Editor application.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation can also lead to a denial-of-service condition within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector involves the use of specially crafted files. An attacker would need to insert such a file into the application.
*  The advisory states "This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely"

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs some form of local access or the ability to transfer malicious files to the system running the vulnerable software.
*   **User Interaction:** The exploit requires user interaction, since the user must open the crafted file.
*   **High Skill Level**: The advisory indicates a high skill level is needed to exploit.
