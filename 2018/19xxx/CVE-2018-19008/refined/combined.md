<https://new.abb.com/products/ABB1SAP500400R0001>

For additional information, see the ABB advisory ABBVU-IACT-3BSE091042 at the following location:

[SECURITY - CP400 Panel Builder TextEditor 2.0, Improper input validation vulnerability ABBVU-IACT-3BSE091042](https://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=3BSE091042&LanguageCode=en&DocumentPartId=&Action=Launch)

ABB also recommends the following security practices and firewall configurations to protect process control networks from attacks that originate from outside the network:

* Conduct or reinforce cybersecurity awareness training for users.
* Follow general cybersecurity best practice recommendations for industrial control systems.
* Be aware that it is possible to infect Panel Builder files with malware.
* Be careful with files that are received unexpectedly and/or from unexpected sources.
* Carefully inspect any files transferred between computers, scan them with up-to-date antivirus software, so that only legitimate files are transferred.
* Manage user accounts following the principle of least privilege.

More information on recommended practices can be found in ABB’s Security for Industrial Automation and Control Systems paper - 3BSE032547.

NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS-CERT website](/ics/) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

NCCIC also recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:

* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.
* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](/reading_room/emailscams_0905.pdf) for more information on avoiding email scams.
* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](/cas/tips/ST04-014.html) for more information on social engineering attacks.

No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely. High skill level is needed to exploit.
