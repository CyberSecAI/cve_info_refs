Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### @pearkes **[pearkes](/pearkes)** commented [Dec 6, 2018](#issue-388408857) • edited Loading

Since Consul 0.5.1, our documentation and parts of our implementation have stated that setting `verify_server_hostname` to `true` would implicitly configure `verify_outgoing` to true. A bug in this implementation resulted in this being partially incorrect and resulting in plaintext communication in agent-to-agent RPC.

All affected users can add the verify\_outgoing key (set to `true`) to their configuration and restart all Consul agents - both client and server. We recommend checking the validity of the TLS certificates since the issue may have been masking expired or invalid certificates, as they were not being used.

This corrects the documentation we will make live now, as well as the fix that will go into Consul 1.4.1.

Note that this is assigned [CVE-2018-19653](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4qvx-qq5w-695p "CVE-2018-19653") and we will be posting separately on the Consul mailing list to notify users with more detailed instructions and information.
