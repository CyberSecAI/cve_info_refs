# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Description

[![@bnbdr](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24456233?u=3d4362551f7037a14c5e121d5d9983c47054b89e&v=4&size=48)](/bnbdr)[bnbdr](https://github.com/bnbdr)opened [on Dec 8, 2018](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara/issues/999#issue-388920998)

A malicious **compiled** rule file could escape YARA's virtual machine and execute arbitrary code despite the added checks introduced by `PARANOID_EXEC`.

This is possible due to the design of the virtual machine, which stores and operates on pointers to `YR_OBJECT`s from the virtual stack, as well as the following bugs:

* `OP_COUNT` can be used to read a DWORD from any arbitrary address.
* the VM scratch memory is uninitialized and could leak important addresses from the real stack.

These were assigned the following IDs, respectively:

* [CVE-2018-19976](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wrpm-24mf-gq6c "CVE-2018-19976")
* [CVE-2018-19975](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qmr8-5qxx-8j5h "CVE-2018-19975")
* [CVE-2018-19974](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qgr5-73wm-7w3g "CVE-2018-19974")

and how it can still be used to run arbitrary codeDec 4, 2018

* [#exploit](https://bnbdr.github.io/tags/exploit)
* [#write-up](https://bnbdr.github.io/tags/write-up)
* [#YARA](https://bnbdr.github.io/tags/yara)

Unlike my [fastidious explanation](../swisscheese/) of YARA’s binary rule format, I’ll try to keep this post short by focusing on YARA’s VM architecture and how a compiled rule can **still** be used to run arbitrary code, despite the mitigations added to the latest release of YARA[1](#fn:7).

The issues I’d discovered were assigned [CVE-2018-19974](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-19974), [CVE-2018-19975](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-19975) and [CVE-2018-19976](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-19976).

To skip straight to the exploitation part jump [here](#paranoid-exec), head over to the [repo](//github.com/bnbdr/swisscheese) or the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara/issues/999).

## YARA’s Virtual Machine

YARA’s virtual machine (henceforth referenced as `yvm` for brevity) uses a stack[2](#fn:1) (`vstack`) and has a small scratch memory (`vmem`). All operations of the bytecode use `QWORD` values (`yval`). The virutal machine also supports branching, arithmic operations, etc (implemented in [exec.c](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara/blob/v3.8.1/libyara/exec.c#L190)).

`yvm` allocates a pretty big virtual stack by default (0x4000 bytes). This size is configurable by passing `stack-size` as a command-line argument.

Most opcodes either explicitly or implicitly push or pop off the `vstack`, changing the stack-pointer (`sp`) accordingly. When the opcode `OP_HALT` is reached `yvm` asserts the `vstack` is empty (`sp == 0`).

Contrary to the virtual stack, `vmem` is placed on the **real stack** and is quite small - holding only 16 `yval`s. Accessing this memory region is possible using `OP_PUSH_M` and `OP_POP_M`(amongst others). Both of which use the `vstack` as target or source and have one operand that specifies the index in `vmem` to access.

`yvm` has a `None` equivalent known as `UNDEFINED` (which equals `0xFFFABADAFABADAFF`) to differentiate between “Falsy” and `UNDEFINED` cases. This is used for “fail” cases like converting strings to numbers, dividing by zero, etc.

### types

To fully support all of YARA’s features, the bytecode has several different core types of `yval`s:

`int64`
`double`
`pointer`
`object`
`match-string`
`string`
`regex`

Out of the above, most noteworthy is the `object` type which corresponds to the `YR_OBJECT` struct [in YARA’s implementation](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara/blob/v3.8.1/libyara/include/yara/types.h#L681). This is used to support “named” objects (`yobj`) that are exposed by `yvm` and its modules[3](#fn:2), and fall between the following “class” types:

| **class** | **exposed functionality** | **opcode** | **yara rule example** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **structure** | fetch member `yobj` by name | `OP_OBJ_FIELD` | `pe.number_of_sections` |
| **dictionary** | fetch `yobj` by name | `OP_LOOKUP_DICT` | `pe.version_info["CompanyName"]` |
| **array** | fetch `yobj` at index | `OP_INDEX_ARRAY` | `dotnet.streams[i]` |
| **`yval` wrapper** | fetch `yobj`’s `yval` | `OP_OBJ_VALUE` | `pe.number_of_sections == 1` |
| **function** | peform action with `yval` list | `OP_CALL` | `pe.imports("LoadLibrary")` |

Before performing any of the above the bytecode must load the `yobj` to the stack using `OP_OBJ_LOAD`. To check `pe.number_of_sections` the bytecode would have to do something like this:

```
OP_OBJ_LOAD     ascii   "pe"
# stack: [pe<yobj>]
OP_OBJ_FIELD    ascii   "number_of_sections"
# stack: [number_of_sections<yobj>]
OP_OBJ_VALUE
# stack: [1<yval>]
...

```
### modules

If you go ahead and disassemble[4](#fn:3) the following rule you’ll notice a few extra opcodes were generated compared to the above `yarasm`[5](#fn:4):

```
import "pe"

rule single_section
{
    condition:
        pe.number_of_sections == 1
}

```

One of them is `OP_IMPORT`. It tells `yvm` to load the `"pe"` module- otherwise `OP_OBJ_LOAD` would fail to locate a `yobj` with that identifier. At this point `yvm` hands over the heavylifting to `yr_modules_load` where the loading logic is performed in two steps:

1. **declarations**: creating a tree of “named” objects (`yobj`s) for the `yvm` runtime.
2. **parsing**: iterating over the input to be scanned and initializing the relavant `yobj`s that were decalred in the previous step.

Basically, all the `yobs` declared in the **declarations** step can now be “found” by `OP_OBJ_LOAD`.

### functions

`yvm` allows its modules to “export” functions for the bytecode to call. Just like any other `yobj`, function-class `yobj`s are found in the same manner. The only difference as far as the bytecode goes is using them.

As noted by the [docs](https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/v3.8.1/writingmodules.html), YARA allows function overloading:

```
begin_declarations;
/*                                        code
                                ret-val    |
                        arg-list  |        |
                   name     |     |        |
                     V      V     |        V                     */
   declare_function("md5", "ii", "s", data_md5);
   declare_function("md5", "s", "s", string_md5);

end_declarations;

```

Therefore, whenever `OP_CALL` is encountered `yvm` will check the length of the arg-list format (the operand) and pop `yval`s from the `vstack` to an `args` array (limited to 128 `yval`s). `yvm` will then use the next `yval` off the `vstack` as a function-`yobj` and search it for the matching prototype.

---

## “PARANOID\_EXEC”

YARA version 3.8.1 introduced `PARANOID_EXEC` to mitigate maliciously compiled bytecode (with added checks on the rule file itself too). Most importantly it added:

* boundry checks on all opcodes that access `vmem`
* boundry checks before writing to `args` array (which is on the **real stack**)
* extra checks on `vstack` boundries
* a canary in every `yobj` created by `yvm`, randomized when YARA is initialized.

## The paranoid is never entirely mistaken

This too started with pure intentions. I wish to contribute a feature to YARA; one I couldn’t implement without looking carefully at YARA’s modules with regards to their life-cycle and their interaction with the bytecode.

#### [CVE-2018-19976](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-19976)

Only after some time did it hit me - the entire concept of loading a `yobj` to the stack is itself an info-leak, **by design**. And due to the architecture of `yvm` I could change that pointer however I liked using arithmic opcodes to point someplace else, hopefully user-controlled.

Even if I leave it to ~~chance~~ ASLR and hope for the best, almost all the promising opcodes check the canary and the class type of the `yobj` before touching it, making it *[literally](https://xkcd.com/1108/)* impossible.

#### [CVE-2018-19975](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-19975)

Cue in `OP_COUNT`:

```
    // no checks here
    r1.i = r1.s->matches[tidx].count;

```

Which to those less familiar with YARA code, loosly[6](#fn:8) translates to:

```
    *TOS <-- *(UINT_PTR)(*TOS+0x38)

```
#### [CVE-2018-19974](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-19974)

To top it all of, I realized that `vmem` was uninitalized, leaking some more addresses (but not necessary for my PoC).

## It hurt itself in its confusion

I’d set onwards to write a PoC exploit. The master plan was building a fake **function** `yobj` on the `vstack`. To make sure it works I had to set the overload prototype for the function, point the code to a gadget, populate the leaked canary, and then make YARA use that fake `yobj` to my advantage by executing `OP_CALL`.

There was one lingering issue - where exactly is the `vstack`?

Before I started skimming through the available leaked values in the uninitalized `vmem`, I remembered `OP_IMPORT` causes a lot of allocations and I can control when. Long story short, the `vstack` is reliably positioned `0x20450`(or `0x20490` if debugging in VS) behind the `"pe"` module[7](#fn:5).

So now I got a lovely fake `yobj` whose “function” address will be called using the following prototype:

```
typedef int (*OP_CALL_TARGET)(void*, void*, void*);

```

There was still the matter of building and placing a ROP chain. As for building- getting to a **real** function `yobj` is really easy with `OP_OBJ_LOAD`/`OB_OBJ_FIELD`. And since all of YARA’s modules are statically compiled I can easily infer YARA’s base address by “loading” an existing function `yobj`.

Ironically, the largest buffer under my control that’s also placed on the real stack is the `args` array. By setting a large enough arg-list format for my fake function `yobj` I can populate it with up to 128 `yvals` - 256 gadgets! The only thing missing is that first gadget to start it all- to return right into my `args` array. Luckily finding a rogue `add esp, 0XXh; ret` was easy enough.

At this point I felt pleased with my PoC and settled on locating `WinExec` by calculating its offset[7](#fn:5) from `GetProcAddress`, which is imported by YARA.

### Epilogue

I tried making the [yara assembly code](//github.com/bnbdr/swisscheese/tree/d789b187de43241f9c408b39436bafbf2c7d07f8/extracheese.yarasm) for this exploit as readable as possible and wrote a [syntax highlighting extension](//github.com/bnbdr/swisscheese/tree/d789b187de43241f9c408b39436bafbf2c7d07f8/yarasm-syntax/) for VSCode. I encourage those curious to take a look.
