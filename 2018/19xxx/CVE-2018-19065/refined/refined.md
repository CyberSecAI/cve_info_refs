Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-19065:

**1. Verification:**

The provided text directly mentions `4. Use of Hard-coded Credentials: Configuration back-up file (CWE-798) [CVE-2018-19065, CVE-2018-19066]` which indicates it is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Hardcoded Encryption Key:** The Foscam device uses a hardcoded password ("BpP+2R9\*Q" or "Pxift\*") to encrypt the configuration backup file. This allows anyone with the password to decrypt the backup file.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials):** The primary vulnerability is the use of hardcoded credentials for encryption. The same key is used across devices.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker can decrypt the configuration backup file, potentially revealing sensitive information such as administrative credentials, network configurations, and other settings. This could allow further attacks on the device or the network it is connected to.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Configuration File Access:** An attacker needs to obtain a copy of the configuration backup file from a vulnerable device.
*   **Decryption:**  The attacker needs to utilize the hardcoded encryption key using `openssl` to decrypt the archive file.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Configuration File:** The attacker must have access to the configuration backup file which can be obtained either by having administrative access or gaining access to the device via other exploits.
*   **Technical Knowledge:**  The attacker needs to know the openssl command along with the hardcoded password to decrypt the archive.

**Summary:**

CVE-2018-19065 is due to the use of hardcoded encryption keys to secure configuration backup files in Foscam IP cameras. This allows anyone with the key to decrypt the file, exposing potentially sensitive information.
