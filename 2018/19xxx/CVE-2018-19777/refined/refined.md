{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an infinite loop in the `svg_dev_end_tile` function within `fitz/svg-device.c` due to zero values for `t->step.x` and `t->step.y` which are used as loop counters, resulting in no progress in the loop.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Infinite loop vulnerability due to incorrect handling of tile step values."
    ],
    "impact": "The infinite loop can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, consuming excessive resources and preventing the application from processing further requests or completing tasks.",
    "attack_vectors": "A specially crafted PDF file processed by MuPDF can trigger the infinite loop when converting to SVG format.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a crafted PDF file to be processed by MuPDF which triggers the `svg_dev_end_tile` function with a pattern that has a step of 0, either directly or due to floating point calculation errors."
  },
  "affected_component": "Artifex MuPDF 1.14.0",
    "additional_information": "The provided content references a related bug fix commit [754ac68f119e0c25cd33c5d652d8aabd533a9fb3](http://www.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/findgit.cgi?754ac68f119e0c25cd33c5d652d8aabd533a9fb3) which addresses the infinite loop by setting the zero values to 1.  However, the initial fix was not complete and an attacker could still trigger the bug by providing very small but non-zero step values such that the loop would proceed for a very long time"
