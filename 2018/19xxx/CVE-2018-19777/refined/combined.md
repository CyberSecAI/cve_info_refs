| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=700301#c0)  kuaicar87    2018-11-30 03:08:49 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 16426](attachment.cgi?id=16426 "the POC to trigger the bug") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=16426&action=edit "the POC to trigger the bug") the POC to trigger the bug  When I tried to convert a pdf file to svg file, there is an infite loop in svg_dev_end_tile in source/fitz/svg-device.c.   ``` static void svg_dev_end_tile(fz_context *ctx, fz_device *dev) { ......  for (x = 0; x > -w; x -= t->step.x) 		for (y = 0; y > -h; y -= t->step.y) 			fz_write_printf(ctx, out, "<use x=\"%g\" y=\"%g\" xlink:href=\"#pac%d\"/>\n", x, y, t->pattern);  } gef➤  p t.step $11 = {   x = 0,    y = 0 } ``` because the values of t->step.x and t->step.y always are zero, so the program can be stuck in infinite loop state. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=700301#c1)  kuaicar87    2018-11-30 03:10:23 UTC  ``` This bug is reported by fish@360TeamSeri0us, please send email to teamSeri0us360@gmail.com if you have some quetions. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=700301#c2)  M.J.G.    2019-05-13 13:00:59 UTC  ``` I can confirm this bug is still present in 1.15.0. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=700301#c3)  Tor Andersson    2019-05-15 17:05:28 UTC  ``` commit [754ac68f119e0c25cd33c5d652d8aabd533a9fb3](http://www.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/findgit.cgi?754ac68f119e0c25cd33c5d652d8aabd533a9fb3) Author: Robin Watts <Robin.Watts@artifex.com> Date:   Mon May 13 13:28:57 2019 +0100      [Bug 700301](show_bug.cgi?id=700301 "RESOLVED FIXED - infinite loop in function svg_dev_end_tile in source/fitz/svg-device.c"): Fix potential infinite loop in svg output device.          The POC in the bug no longer triggers the problem, but potentially     the problem is there all the same.          Spot an attempt to define a pattern with X or Y height of 0, and     cope with it. We print a warning, and reset the X or Y step to 1. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=700301#c4)  M.J.G.    2019-05-16 13:16:21 UTC  ``` I don't want to be extra picky, but I'm not sure this fix is complete:  Since we're dealing with floats here, xstep and ystep may very well be != 0 (say, only in the lowest digit) but as soon as we add up the steps often enough (say, 10^d times, d the representable digits) we will have x == x - xstep, i.e. the same problem.  Thus, an evil attacker can still trigger the bug with specifically chosen steps.  I see two possible solutions:  - impose a larger lower bound on the step size (then just >0) in begin_tile()  - check for x-xstep != xstep in end_tile(); might be too expensive ``` |  |

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-10f02ad597
2019-11-12 02:08:10.642359
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : mupdf
Product : Fedora 30
Version : 1.16.1
Release : 1.fc30
URL : <http://mupdf.com/>
Summary : A lightweight PDF viewer and toolkit
Description :
MuPDF is a lightweight PDF viewer and toolkit written in portable C.
The renderer in MuPDF is tailored for high quality anti-aliased
graphics. MuPDF renders text with metrics and spacing accurate to
within fractions of a pixel for the highest fidelity in reproducing
the look of a printed page on screen.
MuPDF has a small footprint. A binary that includes the standard
Roman fonts is only one megabyte. A build with full CJK support
(including an Asian font) is approximately five megabytes.
MuPDF has support for all non-interactive PDF 1.7 features, and the
toolkit provides a simple API for accessing the internal structures of
the PDF document. Example code for navigating interactive links and
bookmarks, encrypting PDF files, extracting fonts, images, and
searchable text, and rendering pages to image files is provided.

Bug 700301: Fix potential infinite loop in svg output device.The POC in the bug no longer triggers the problem, but potentially
the problem is there all the same.
