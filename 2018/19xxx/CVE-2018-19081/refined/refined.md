- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Foscam camera's ONVIF implementation allows anonymous access to the `devicemgmt` `SetDNS` method, which is vulnerable to command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Unauthenticated remote command injection
    - Improper access control (anonymous ONVIF access)
    - Insufficient input sanitization in the `SetDNS` method
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Arbitrary command execution as root on the device.
    - Full compromise of the device, including potential for malware installation and use as a bot in a botnet.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Network-based, through ONVIF protocol, specifically the `SetDNS` method
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs network connectivity to the device.
    - No authentication is required as the ONVIF implementation allows anonymous access.
    - The attacker needs to send a crafted ONVIF `SetDNS` request containing shell commands.
