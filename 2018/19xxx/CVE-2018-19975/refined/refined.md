{
  "CVE-2018-19975": {
    "Description": "In YARA 3.8.1, bytecode in a specially crafted compiled rule can read data from any arbitrary address in memory, in libyara/exec.c. Specifically, OP_COUNT can read a DWORD.",
    "Root cause": "The `OP_COUNT` instruction in YARA's bytecode does not perform bounds checks when accessing memory, leading to an arbitrary memory read.",
     "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer [CWE-125]"
      ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can read arbitrary memory, potentially gaining sensitive information. This can lead to information disclosure and may enable further exploitation.",
    "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious YARA rule with specific bytecode instructions, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability when the rule is loaded and executed.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create and compile malicious YARA rules and then have them executed by a vulnerable YARA instance. This typically requires local access or the ability to submit rules to a YARA engine. No special privileges are required."
