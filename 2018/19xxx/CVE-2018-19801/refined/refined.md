{
  "CVE-2018-19801": {
    "description": "aubio v0.4.0 to v0.4.8 has a NULL pointer dereference in new_aubio_filterbank via invalid n_filters.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a missing validation of the n_filters parameter in the `new_aubio_filterbank` function. When an invalid `n_filters` value is provided, a NULL pointer dereference occurs.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "NULL pointer dereference",
      "Missing input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit of this vulnerability can lead to a denial of service (DoS) due to the application crashing.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by providing an invalid value for the `n_filters` parameter to the `new_aubio_filterbank` function.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to control the input parameters to the `new_aubio_filterbank` function. This can occur via a network call, malicious file, or other means. No special privileges are required."
