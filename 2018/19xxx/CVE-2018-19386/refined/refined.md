- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `idcStateError.iwc` error page in SolarWinds Database Performance Analyzer does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `page` parameter, leading to a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application directly includes the unsanitized `page` parameter in the HTML response within an `href` attribute.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the user's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, and data theft.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing the JavaScript payload in the `page` parameter and induce a victim to visit the crafted URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send the crafted URL to the target user, typically through a phishing email, malicious link, or other social engineering means. No prior authentication is necessary to exploit this vulnerability.
