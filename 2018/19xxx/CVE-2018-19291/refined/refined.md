Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the DiliCMS application. Specifically, the application allows user and user group deletion actions via simple GET requests without any CSRF tokens or other validation mechanisms.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **CSRF Vulnerability:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of CSRF protection. This means that an attacker can craft malicious web pages that, when visited by an authenticated administrator, trigger actions on the vulnerable DiliCMS application.
- **GET-based Sensitive Actions:** The application uses GET requests for sensitive actions like user and user group deletion, which makes these actions easily triggerable by an attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **User Deletion:** An attacker can force a logged-in administrator to delete users in the system.
- **User Group Deletion:** An attacker can force a logged-in administrator to delete user groups, which potentially impacts the application's access control and user management.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted HTML page that includes `<img>` tags that point to the deletion URLs in DiliCMS. This can be delivered to the victim via various methods, such as:
  - Embedding the malicious HTML in a forum post
  - Sending the malicious HTML via email
  - Hosting it on a website and enticing the administrator to visit the page

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Attacker must create a malicious HTML page:** The attacker needs the ability to create and host HTML or embed it somewhere a victim might view it.
- **Victim must be logged into DiliCMS as an administrator:** The attack relies on the victim having an active session with administrative privileges in the DiliCMS application.
- **Victim interaction required:** The victim must load/render the malicious HTML page in their browser.

**Additional Details:**

The provided content gives specific examples of how the exploit works. It includes HTML snippets that show how to exploit both the user and group deletion vulnerabilities via simple `<img>` tags. This level of detail is not present in a standard CVE description, making this information valuable.
