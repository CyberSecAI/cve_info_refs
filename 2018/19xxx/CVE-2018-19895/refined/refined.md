The provided content describes multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in ThinkCMF X2.2.2.

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root cause:** Improper handling of user-supplied input within the `check/delete` method of `CommentadminController.class.php`. Specifically, the `$_POST['ids']` parameter is directly concatenated into an SQL query without proper sanitization or the use of parameterized queries.
*   **Weakness:** SQL Injection due to direct string concatenation into SQL statements.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.
*  **Attack vector:** Sending a POST request to `/index.php?g=Comment&m=commentadmin&a=check&check=1` with a crafted `ids[]` parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires manager privileges.

**Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Root cause:** Direct use of the unsanitized `$_POST['parentid']` parameter within the `edit_post` method of `NavController.class.php`, which leads to SQL injection when constructing the where clause in SQL query.
*  **Weakness:** SQL Injection due to direct string concatenation into SQL statements.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a POST request to `/index.php?g=Admin&m=nav&a=edit_post` with a malicious `parentid` parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires manager privileges.

**Vulnerability 3:**

*  **Root cause:**  The `delete` method in `SlideController.class.php` uses `implode` on `$_POST['ids']` and then directly concatenates the result into the where clause, leading to SQL injection.
*   **Weakness:** SQL Injection due to direct string concatenation into SQL statements.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries.
*  **Attack vector:** Sending a POST request to `/index.php?g=Admin&m=slide&a=delete` with a crafted `ids[]` parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires manager privileges.

**Vulnerability 4:**

*   **Root cause:** The `_listorders` method in `AdminbaseController.class.php` processes user-provided data in `$_POST['listorders']` and uses it to construct SQL queries.  Specifically, if the first element of the array is 'exp', then the second element is concatenated directly to the query.
*   **Weakness:** SQL Injection vulnerability during the update of `listorder` in database records, caused by an unsafe handling of user input within the `_listorders` method.
*  **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a POST request to `/index.php?g=Admin&m=Link&a=listorders` with a crafted `listorders` parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires manager privileges.

**Vulnerability 5:**

*   **Root cause:**  The `edit_post` method in `ArticleController.class.php` is vulnerable to a 'bind' SQL injection due to the way ThinkPHP 3.2.3 handles array input when used in conjunction with 'bind'.
*   **Weakness:** SQL Injection vulnerability due to usage of the `bind` keyword in user-controlled input.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a POST request to `/index.php?g=portal&m=article&a=edit_post` with a crafted `post[id][0]` and `post[id][1]` parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires only normal user privileges.
