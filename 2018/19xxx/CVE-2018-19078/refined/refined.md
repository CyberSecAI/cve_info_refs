The provided content is related to CVE-2018-19078.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an improper access control in the Foscam camera's ONVIF implementation, allowing anonymous access. Specifically, the `GetStreamUri` method discloses administrative credentials.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Control:** The ONVIF implementation allows unauthenticated access to the `GetStreamUri` method, which should require authentication.
- **Credential Disclosure:** The `GetStreamUri` method returns the administrator's username and password in the URI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential Disclosure:** An unauthenticated attacker can obtain the administrator's username and password. This would grant the attacker the ability to fully control the device and gain access to sensitive resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Foscam camera's ONVIF service (typically port 888).
- **ONVIF Method:** The attacker uses the ONVIF `media GetStreamUri` method without authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need any credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to communicate with the ONVIF service on the vulnerable device.
- **ONVIF Client:** The attacker needs a tool or script capable of making ONVIF requests, such as the provided `cli.py` script.

**Additional Notes**
- This vulnerability does not appear to exist on all Foscam camera models or firmware versions.
- The specific example provided in the document uses the `cli.py` tool to demonstrate the vulnerability.
- The extracted URI will contain credentials similar to `rtsp://root:toor@HOST:88/videoMain`, which provides the administrative username and password.
