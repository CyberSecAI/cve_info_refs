Root cause of vulnerability:
The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when exporting data, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit other vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Attack vectors:
A malicious GET request to /exports/export.php with a crafted XSS payload within the datatoexport parameter.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted GET request to the vulnerable endpoint.
