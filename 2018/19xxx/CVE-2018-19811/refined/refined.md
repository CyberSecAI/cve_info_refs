  "CVE-2018-19811": {
    "root_cause": "The web application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it in the web page, leading to a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Improper input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or phishing attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker can craft a malicious URL containing JavaScript code in the 'ConnPoolName' parameter and entice a victim to click it. The vulnerable application will then execute the attacker's script within the context of the user's session when the victim navigates to the crafted URL.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and convince a victim to click on it. This could be achieved through social engineering or by inserting the malicious URL into a web page or email."
