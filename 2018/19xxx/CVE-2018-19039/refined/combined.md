You’re probably curious whether this issue affects you.  [CVE-2018-19039 “File Exfiltration vulnerability Security fix”](https://grafana.com/blog/2018/11/13/grafana-5.3.3-and-4.6.5-released-with-important-security-fix/) covers a recently discovered security flaw that allows any Grafana user with Editor or Admin permissions to have read access to the filesystem, performed with the same privileges as the Grafana process has.

We have good news: **if you’re running PMM 1.10.0 or later ([released April 2018](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/release-notes/1.10.0.html)), you’re not affected by this security issue.**

The reason you’re not affected is an interesting one. CVE-2018-19039 relates to Grafana component PhantomJS, which Percona omitted when we changed how we build the version of Grafana embedded in Percona Monitoring and Management. We became aware of this via bug [PMM-2837](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-2837) when we discovered images do not render.

We fixed this image rendering issue in and applied the required security update in [1.17](https://www.percona.com/blog/2018/11/20/percona-monitoring-and-management-pmm-1-17-0-is-now-available). This ensures PMM is not vulnerable to CVE-2018-19039.

Users of PMM who are running release [1.1.0](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/release-notes/1.1.0beta.html) (February 2017) through [1.9.1](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/release-notes/1.9.1.html) (April 2018) are advised to upgrade ASAP.  If you cannot immediately upgrade, we advise that you take two steps:

1. Convert all Grafana users to Viewer role
2. Remove all Dashboards that contain text panels
## How to Get PMM Server

PMM is available for installation using three methods:

* [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/percona/pmm-server/) – `docker pull percona/pmm-server` – [Documentation](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/deploy/server/docker.html)
* [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B077J7FYGX) – [Documentation](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/deploy/server/ami.html)
* [Open Virtualization Format (OVF)](https://www.percona.com/downloads/pmm/) – [Documentation](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/deploy/server/virtual-appliance.html)

# Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) 1.17.0 Is Now Available

November 20, 2018

[Dmitriy Kostiuk](https://www.percona.com/blog/author/dmitriy-kostiuk)

![Percona Monitoring and Management 1.17.0](data:image/svg+xml...)

[Percona Monitoring and Management 1.17.0 (PMM)](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/index.html) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL performance. You can run Percona Monitoring and Management 1.17.0 in your own environment for maximum security and reliability. It provides thorough time-based analysis for MySQL®, MongoDB®, and PostgreSQL® servers to ensure that your data works as efficiently as possible.

Although we patched a bug this release related to a Grafana CVE announcement, previous releases since 1.10 (April 2018) were not vulnerable, and we encourage you to see our [Grafana CVE blog post](https://www.percona.com/blog/2018/11/20/percona-monitoring-and-management-pmm-1-17-0-is-now-available) for further details.

In this release, we made six improvements and fixed 11 bugs.

## Dashboard Improvements

We updated five Dashboards with improved Tooltips – If you haven’t seen this before, hover your mouse over the ![](data:image/svg+xml...) icon in the top left of most graph elements, and you’ll see a new box appear.  This box provides a brief description of what the graph displays, along with links to related documentation resources so you can learn further.  We hope you find the content useful!

![Percona Monitoring and Management 1.17.0](data:image/svg+xml...)

The Dashboards we’re updating are:

1. MySQL Amazon Aurora Metrics
2. MySQL MyISAM/Aria Metrics
3. MySQL Replication
4. Prometheus Exporters Overview
5. Trends

We hope you enjoy this release, and we welcome your feedback via the [Percona PMM Forums](https://percona.com/forums/questions-discussions/percona-monitoring-and-management/)!

If you have ever used backups with Percona Distribution for MongoDB Operator, you should already know that backed-up data is stored outside the Kubernetes cluster – on Amazon S3 or any S3-compatible storage. Storage types not compatible with the S3 protocol were supported indirectly in the case of an existing S3 wrapper/gateway. A good example […]

At some point, your needs for improving database performance may run into a threshold where optimization and tuning are no longer enough. If you cannot change the database engine and can no longer tune the parameters for your workload, you need to use scaling. As it is widely known, scaling may be either vertical or […]

In most cases, MySQL password instructions provide information on changing MySQL user passwords on the production system (e.g., reset root password without restart).

# [Grafana 5.3.3 and 4.6.5 Security Update](/t/grafana-5-3-3-and-4-6-5-security-update/11961)

[Grafana](/c/support/security-announcements/38)

File Exfiltration vulnerability (CVE-2018-19039)

On the 5th of November at 1700 CEST we were contacted about a potential security issue that could allow any users with Editor or Admin permissions in Grafana to read any file that the Grafana process can read from the filesystem. Note, that in order to exploit this you would need to be logged in to the system as a legitimate user with Editor or Admin permissions.

#### Affected versions

Grafana releases 4.1 through 5.3.2 are affected by this vulnerability.

#### Solutions and mitigations

All installations between 4.1.0 and 5.3.2 that have users that should not have access to the filesystem where Grafana is running must be upgraded as soon as possible. If you can not upgrade, you should set all users to viewers and remove all dashboards that contain text panels.

All instances of [Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/cloud) have already been updated to 5.3.3. Grafana Enterprise customers have been proactively noticed.

We would like to thank Daniele Costa, NCC Group for reporting this issue.

### Conclusion

If you run a Grafana between version 4.1.0 and 5.3.2 with users that should not have access to the filesystem where Grafana is running, please upgrade to Grafana [5.3.3](https://grafana.com/grafana/download/5.3.3) or [4.6.5](https://grafana.com/grafana/download/4.6.5) as soon as possible.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# How CVE-2018-19039 Affects Percona Monitoring and Management

November 20, 2018

[Dmitriy Kostiuk](https://www.percona.com/blog/author/dmitriy-kostiuk) and [Michael Coburn](https://www.percona.com/blog/author/michael-coburn)

[![CVE-2018-19039](data:image/svg+xml...)](https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CVE-2016-6663-and-CVE-2016-6664.jpg)Grafana Labs has released an important security update, and as you’re aware PMM uses Grafana internally. You’re probably curious whether this issue affects you.  [CVE-2018-19039 “File Exfiltration vulnerability Security fix”](https://grafana.com/blog/2018/11/13/grafana-5.3.3-and-4.6.5-released-with-important-security-fix/) covers a recently discovered security flaw that allows any Grafana user with Editor or Admin permissions to have read access to the filesystem, performed with the same privileges as the Grafana process has.

We have good news: **if you’re running PMM 1.10.0 or later ([released April 2018](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/release-notes/1.10.0.html)), you’re not affected by this security issue.**

The reason you’re not affected is an interesting one. CVE-2018-19039 relates to Grafana component PhantomJS, which Percona omitted when we changed how we build the version of Grafana embedded in Percona Monitoring and Management. We became aware of this via bug [PMM-2837](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-2837) when we discovered images do not render.

We fixed this image rendering issue in and applied the required security update in [1.17](https://www.percona.com/blog/2018/11/20/percona-monitoring-and-management-pmm-1-17-0-is-now-available). This ensures PMM is not vulnerable to CVE-2018-19039.

Users of PMM who are running release [1.1.0](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/release-notes/1.1.0beta.html) (February 2017) through [1.9.1](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/release-notes/1.9.1.html) (April 2018) are advised to upgrade ASAP.  If you cannot immediately upgrade, we advise that you take two steps:

1. Convert all Grafana users to Viewer role
2. Remove all Dashboards that contain text panels
## How to Get PMM Server

PMM is available for installation using three methods:

* [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/percona/pmm-server/) – `docker pull percona/pmm-server` – [Documentation](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/deploy/server/docker.html)
* [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B077J7FYGX) – [Documentation](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/deploy/server/ami.html)
* [Open Virtualization Format (OVF)](https://www.percona.com/downloads/pmm/) – [Documentation](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/deploy/server/virtual-appliance.html)

## [SlamData](http://slamdata.com/)

SlamData is the leading provider of post relational analytics. Modern applications including IoT, social media and SaaS often create and store data in non-relational formats, including JSON, XML, or CSV. These formats do not fit easily into a relational data structure required for querying with existing analytics and BI tools. This forces organizations to build complex ETL processes or spend weeks attempting to wrangle the data. SlamData is the only solution that works natively against any data regardless of degree of structure. The open source solution allows users to explore, query and visualize complex data without any ETL or mapping, ever. User can easily embed reports and build interactive dashboards that reflect live data stored in MongoDB. SlamData powers analytics and reporting solutions for Fortune 500 companies, startups and government agencies. It’s the go-to tool for software developers, data scientists, business intelligence professionals, product managers and more.

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2020-13362.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2020-13396.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2020-13379 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-13379)

#### Description

The avatar feature in Grafana 3.0.1 through 7.0.1 has an SSRF Incorrect Access Control issue. This vulnerability allows any unauthenticated user/client to make Grafana send HTTP requests to any URL and return its result to the user/client. This can be used to gain information about the network that Grafana is running on. Furthermore, passing invalid URL objects could be used for DOS'ing Grafana via SegFault.

# Percona Careers

Live and work from anywhere!

[Find your next role](#get-started)

### Remote by Design

Since its founding in 2006, Percona has always been a remote company. The reason? It’s a tech company that knows how to use technology effectively and doesn’t want to have geography limit its talent pool, said CEO Ann Schlemmer.
![](data:image/svg+xml...)

We have a high degree of trust with our staff. Leaders aren’t checking to see what time workers log in each day or moni toring if their light on Slack is green. You can’t have that sort of behavior and have an effective remote company. I have pride in how we live our values. That’s one of our values: We don’t care where you’re located... If someone is a digital nomad and that’s their lifestyle and that makes them happiest, I think that brings productivity. The goal is for employees to get their work done and then just enjoy life.”
![](data:image/svg+xml...)
**Ann Schlemmer**
CEO Percona

![](data:image/svg+xml...)

Every day at Percona, I am fortunate to collaborate with exceptional colleagues across every department, creating an environment where expertise is all around us. Our collective excellence is not only a daily inspiration, but it also raises the performance bar for everyone. I am truly grateful to be a part of a culture where our commitment to core values is palpable, driving our unwavering dedication to delivering for our customers, community, and colleagues. We rarely have a boring day here at Percona!”
![](data:image/svg+xml...)
**Bennie Grant**
COO Percona

![](data:image/svg+xml...)

What keeps me excited every day is Percona's unique culture and remote-only approach.

## Topic

An update for ceph and grafana is now available for Red Hat Ceph Storage 2.5 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Ceph Storage is a scalable, open, software-defined storage platform that combines the most stable version of the Ceph storage system with a Ceph management platform, deployment utilities, and support services.

Security Fix(es):

* grafana: File exfiltration (CVE-2018-19039)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Bug Fix(es):

* This issue was discovered with OpenStack Cinder Backup when 'rados\_connect\_timeout' was set. Normally the timeout is not enabled. If the cluster was highly loaded the timeout could be reached, causing the segfault. With this update to Red Hat Ceph Storage, if the timeout is reached a segfault no longer occurs. (BZ#1655685)
* With this release, you now have the ability to reset a user's statistics using the 'radosgw-admin' command. In previous versions, the user's recorded statistics diverged from the actual statistics. When using the '--reset-stats' option with the 'radosgw-admin' command, along with specifying the Ceph Object Gateway user, the stats will be recalculated. (BZ#1673217)
* In the duplicate checking code an inconsistency was found that caused duplicate indices to be added, instead of trimming them. The duplicate checking code logic has been fixed, making adding and trimming duplicate indices consistent, which results in correctly trimming duplicate indices. (BZ#1676709)
* Two bugs were found in the garbage collection list iteration logic. One of these bugs was a race condition when doing system restarts. These bugs were causing higher-than-expected workloads and stalling in garbage collection processing. Issues with list truncation and entry deletion were fixed, reducing the potential for garbage collection stalls and high-read I/O during garbage collection removal. (BZ#1680050)
* Due to a bug in multi-site sync of versioning-suspended buckets, certain object versioning attributes were overwritten with incorrect values. Consequently, the objects failed to sync and attempted to retry endlessly, blocking further sync progress. With this update, the sync process no longer overwrites versioning attributes. In addition, any broken attributes are now detected and repaired. As a result, objects are synced correctly in versioning-suspended buckets. (BZ#1690927)
* Previously, bucket indices could include "false entries" that did not represent actual objects and that resulted from a prior bug. Consequently, during the process of deleting such buckets, encountering a false entry caused the process to stop and return an error code. With this update, when a false entry is encountered, Ceph ignores it, and deleting buckets with false entries works as expected. (BZ#1690930)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1653307#c0)  Vasishta    2018-11-26 14:05:57 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1508579](attachment.cgi?id=1508579 "File contains playbook log") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1508579&action=edit "File contains playbook log") File contains playbook log  Description of problem: Tried purging a cluster initiated using lvm_batch scenario. lvms were not removed though playbook succeeded.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): ceph-ansible-3.2.0-0.1.rc3.el7cp.noarch  How reproducible: Always (2/2)  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Configure a cluster (we tried containerized cluster) with osds configured usin lvm_batch 2.purge the cluster  Actual results: playbook completes successfully, lvms created during initializing the cluster are not removed  Expected results: lvms created during cluster configurations must be removed if user wants to purge the clusters.  Additional info:   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1653307#c3)  Andrew Schoen    2018-11-26 16:14:42 UTC  ``` The purge-docker-cluster.yml playbook is not using the ceph-volume module provided by ceph-ansible to zap these devices. Sebastian, is the zap container being used in that playbook using 'ceph-volume lvm zap --destroy'? Can this playbook also use the ceph-volume module?   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1653307#c4)  seb    2018-11-26 16:27:30 UTC  ``` I have a PR for this here: <https://github.com/ceph/ceph-ansible/pull/3195/files> I just haven't had the time to pursue this.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1653307#c5)  Vasishta    2018-11-26 17:20:57 UTC  ``` Can we target this bz to 3.2 ?   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1653307#c7)  Vasishta    2018-11-29 17:11:56 UTC  ``` I was just being optimistic as lvms were removed in non-containerized scenario and there was some work already done on fix (PR 3195).  Yes, not a blocker.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1653307#c8)  Andrew Schoen    2018-12-11 15:14:59 UTC  ``` I believe this was fixed with [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1644828](show_bug.cgi?id=1644828 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - ceph-volume zap --destroy should remove LVs completly")  Vasishta, what version of ceph were you testing with? The fix for the BZ I linked should be in ceph-12.2.8-36.el7cp  Thanks, Andrew   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1653307#c9)  Harish NV Rao    2018-12-11 15:56:54 UTC  ``` Andrew, [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1644828](show_bug.cgi?id=1644828 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - ceph-volume zap --destroy should remove LVs completly") is not targeted to 3.2 rc. It is in POST state.  If that BZ is fixed, can you please change the target release and bug state?   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1653307#c10)  Harish NV Rao    2018-12-11 15:59:03 UTC  ``` Andrew, [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1644828](show_bug.cgi?id=1644828 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - ceph-volume zap --destroy should remove LVs completly") is not targeted to 3.2 rc.

The fix for the BZ I > linked should be in ceph-12.2.8-36.el7cp  Sorry, I'm not sure about the ceph version, from logs I think I was using container image ceph-3.2-rhel-7-containers-candidate-38188-20181121222025  We had filed this BZ when we faced issues in playbook purge-dockercl-cluster.yml and being tracked for ceph-ansible PR 3195.

### File Exfiltration vulnerability (CVE-2018-19039)

On the 5th of November at we were contacted about a potential security issue that could allow any users with Editor or Admin permissions in Grafana to read any file that the Grafana process can read from the filesystem. Note, that in order to exploit this you would need to be logged in to the system as a legitimate user with Editor or Admin permissions.

#### Affected versions

Grafana releases 4.1.0 through 5.3.2 are affected by this vulnerability.

#### Solutions and mitigations

All installations between 4.1.0 and 5.3.2 that have users that should not have access to the filesystem where Grafana is running must be upgraded as soon as possible. If you can not upgrade, you should set all users to viewers and remove all dashboards that contain text panels.

All instances of [Grafana Cloud](/cloud) have already been updated to 5.3.3. Grafana Enterprise customers have been provided with fixed binaries ahead of this disclosure.

**CVE ID**: CVE-2018-19039

### Timeline and postmortem

Here is a detailed timeline starting from when we originally learned of the issue.

5 Nov 2018 16:30 CET
Received details of vulnerability from Sebastian Solnica.
6 Nov 2018 13:00 CET
Confirmed issue.
Started working on a fix for latest stable in a private mirror.
Backported the fix to 4.6.5 in private mirror.
6 Nov 2018 16:00 CET
Received CVE-2018-19039
Started preparing 5.3.3 and 4.6.5 release from private mirror.
6 Nov 2018 17:33 CET
Started rolling out 5.3.3 to Grafana Cloud customers.
Decided on making release public on Tuesday Nov 13 13:00 CET. The date was chosen to give people time to prepare and not run into the weekend. The time was chosen to fall into main work time of the EU and US while still giving Asia a fair chance to react.
7 Nov 2018 22:05 CET
Proactively provided Grafana Enterprise customers with details and download links.
Completed rollout of 5.3.3 to Grafana Cloud.
13 Nov 2018 13:00 CET
Publish of release & this blog post.
