- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An abort occurs in `libwebm::Webm2Pes::InitWebmParser()` due to a null pointer being passed to a `std::string` constructor, leading to a `std::logic_error`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The code in `libwebm` does not properly validate input data, specifically allowing a null pointer to be used when constructing a `std::string`. This leads to an unhandled exception.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. The program terminates abnormally, causing it to crash.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a crafted input to the `webm2pes` utility. Specifically, the provided Proof of Concept (POC) uses `/dev/null` as input, which somehow triggers the null pointer issue.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to execute the `webm2pes` utility with crafted input.
