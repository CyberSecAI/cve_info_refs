Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the inadequate validation of network data (specifically block headers and blocks containing coinstake transactions) in chain-based Proof-of-Stake (PoS) cryptocurrencies before committing resources like RAM and disk space. This stems from the insecure adaptation of Bitcoin's "headers-first" feature into PoS implementations. Unlike Proof-of-Work (PoW), where validation is relatively straightforward, PoS validation is more complex and context-sensitive. Implementations have taken shortcuts, leading to exploitable weaknesses.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Lack of Coinstake Validation (Vulnerability #1):**
    *   Some cryptocurrencies fail to validate the coinstake transaction present in a block before storing it in RAM or disk.
    *   This happens when a node receives a block or header that is not part of the longest chain and postpones full validation.
    *   In the case of "headers-first" implementation, the coinstake transaction is not part of the header and thus not validated when a header is received
    *   This allows an attacker to send invalid headers or blocks, filling up the victim's RAM or disk with bogus data.

2.  **Spent Stake Attack (Vulnerability #2):**
    *   Some cryptocurrencies perform a preliminary check to ensure that the output being spent exists in the main chain and that the PoS kernel hash meets the difficulty target. However this check is incomplete.
    *   The check does not verify that the UTXO is unspent and is done against TxDB for the main chain itself even if the block is on a fork.
    *   Attackers can exploit this incomplete validation through "stake amplification," by creating multiple transactions that spend coins back to themselves.
    *   The node is fooled into considering these spent coins as valid stake, effectively amplifying the attacker's apparent stake.
    *   The attacker uses this amplified stake to mine blocks from a past time, then floods the victim with these blocks, leading to resource exhaustion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Attackers can cause victim nodes to crash by filling up their RAM or disk with bogus data.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The crashes and resource exhaustion can effectively render the victim nodes non-functional, disrupting network operations.
*   **Chain Split Risk:** Mitigations involving limiting the length of forks can introduce chain split risk.
*   **Node Banning:** Some mitigations may mistakenly ban honest nodes experiencing legitimate reorgs.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Attack:** The attacks are performed by connecting to a victim node over the network and sending specially crafted headers and blocks.
*   **No Stake Requirement (for Vulnerability #1):**  The initial RAM and disk exhaustion attacks can be carried out without having any stake in the affected cryptocurrency.
*   **Minimal Stake Requirement (for Vulnerability #2):** The spent stake attack requires a small amount of stake, which is then amplified to mine blocks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to a victim node on the network.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Data:** The attacker needs to be able to create specially crafted headers and blocks that exploit the validation weaknesses.
*   **Small Stake (for Spent Stake Attack):** A small amount of stake is required for the spent stake attack, which can be bought on an exchange, then sold back.
*   **No privileged network position is needed.**

**Additional Notes:**
* The attacks were demonstrated and benchmarked, showing that they could fill the victim's RAM at a rate of 2MB per second and the disk at 6MB per second.
*   The vulnerabilities are present in cryptocurrencies that have forked from relatively recent Bitcoin versions (0.10.0 or later) that incorporate the “headers first” feature.
*   The research team performed coordinated vulnerability disclosure to notify affected development teams.
*   Mitigations implemented include heuristics for peer detection, partial validation up to a fixed length, and planned full validation of off-main-chain-blocks.
