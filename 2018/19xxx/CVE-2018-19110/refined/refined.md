Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper access control checks in the backend controllers of the `tianti-module-admin` project. Specifically, the `cmscontroller.java` and `usercontroller.java` do not perform permission checks before executing the main logic of functions that handle requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incorrect Access Control:** The application fails to enforce the intended access restrictions, allowing users with lower-level permissions (e.g., "permission role") to access functionalities meant for higher-level roles (e.g., "super administrator").
*   Specifically, the following endpoints are vulnerable:
    *   `/cms/column/list` which is handled by `columnList` function in `cmscontroller.java`
    *   `/user/skin/list` which is handled by `skinList` function in `usercontroller.java`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Users with the "permission role" can access and modify content management features, including column lists, and skin management features, which are intended for the "super administrator" role only. This leads to unauthorized access, potential data modification, and privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Directly accessing the vulnerable URLs (e.g., `<http://127.0.0.1:8080/tianti-module-admin/cms/column/list>`) after logging in with the "permission role".

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have a valid user account with the "permission role" within the application.
*   The attacker must know or discover the vulnerable endpoints.
*   The attacker needs network access to the application.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue report provides screenshots that demonstrate how the "permission role" user can access and modify content that should be restricted to the "super administrator" role.
*   The vulnerability is described within the context of a Spring Framework application.
*   The vulnerable code locations are identified (files and functions):
    *   `tianti-module-admin\src\main\java\com\jeff\tianti\controller\cmscontroller.java` (columnList function)
    *   `tianti-module-admin\src\main\java\com\jeff\tianti\controller\usercontroller.java` (skinList function)
*   The issue reporter provides a specific recommendation:  "before executing the main logic code of the function where the controller receiver the request from the frontend, please do permission check."
