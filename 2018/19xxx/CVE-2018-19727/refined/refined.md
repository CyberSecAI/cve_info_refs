- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before reflecting it back to the user, allowing the injection of malicious scripts into the user's browser.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to sensitive information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the injection of malicious scripts within user-supplied input. The scripts are then reflected back to the user's browser, where they are executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script in a parameter that is reflected back to the user.
