The content is related to CVE-2018-19856.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a path traversal bug in the `lib/api/templates.rb` file, which handles the Gitignore templates API. This allows a malicious user to read arbitrary files within the GitLab instance by manipulating the file paths.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path Traversal: The API does not properly sanitize user-provided paths, allowing an attacker to use `..` sequences to navigate outside of the intended directory.
- Insecure Symlink Handling: The application fails to remove symlinks during project import, which can be used by attackers to point to sensitive files.
- Information Disclosure: The import error messages expose the full path of imported files, which can be used to craft a path traversal attack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary File Read: An attacker can read any file on the GitLab server with extensions `.gitignore`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, or `.Dockerfile` initially, and any file using a crafted symlink and path traversal.
- Sensitive Data Exposure: This vulnerability can be used to access sensitive configuration files such as `secrets.yaml` and `database.yml`, which can lead to a full compromise of the application and the data.

**Attack vectors:**
1. Direct Path Traversal: Using the API endpoint `/api/v4/templates/gitignores/` with a crafted path containing `..` to access files outside of the intended directory.
2. Symlink Creation: Creating a project with a symbolic link to a sensitive file with the `.gitignore` extension during the project import process.
3. Information Leakage from Import Errors: Obtaining the full path of the symlink from import error messages.
4. Combined Attack: Using the path traversal vulnerability to access the symlinked file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to import projects into the GitLab instance.
- The attacker should also have knowledge of GitLab's internal directory structure in order to construct a valid path traversal.
