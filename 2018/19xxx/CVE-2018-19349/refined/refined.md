The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the `seacms` application.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `$topicId` parameter in the `seacms/include/mkhtml.func.php` file, specifically at line 1172, is not properly sanitized, lacking single quote protection. This bypasses the global GPC (Get/Post/Cookie) single quote protection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The lack of proper sanitization of the `$topicId` parameter allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary SQL queries can be executed on the database, leading to data exfiltration, modification, or denial of service.
- The example provided in the content demonstrates extracting database user information.

**Attack vectors:**
- By manipulating the `topic` parameter in the URL with malicious SQL code.
- Specifically, the vulnerable function is called when a webpage is generated in the background by calling `makeTopicById` function in `seacms/admin/admin_makehtml.php` on line 410.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- The attacker needs knowledge about how the parameters are being handled to craft a suitable SQL injection payload.
