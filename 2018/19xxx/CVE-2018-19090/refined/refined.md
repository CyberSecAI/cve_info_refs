The provided content details multiple XSS vulnerabilities in the `tianti` project, which aligns with the typical nature of CVE-2018-19090, which is a placeholder, and which generally involves an XSS vulnerability.

Here's a breakdown of the identified issues:

**1. Stored XSS in User List Module:**

*   **Root Cause:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input when saving user roles. Specifically, the `name` parameter is vulnerable.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization/encoding in `user_list.jsp` when displaying data retrieved from the controller. The application directly outputs user-controlled data to the HTML context without escaping special characters.
*   **Attack Vector:** A malicious user can inject XSS payloads in the `name` parameter during role creation or update, which will be stored in the database.
*  **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs the ability to save or update roles, implying that they would likely need to be an admin or have elevated permissions within the application.
*   **Impact:** When an administrator views the user list, the stored XSS payload executes, potentially allowing an attacker to steal cookies, escalate privileges, or perform other malicious actions.
*   **Technical Details:**
    *   The vulnerable parameter `name` is submitted via a `POST` request to `/tianti-module-admin/user/ajax/save_role`.
    *   The server-side code does not sanitize the `name` field, and it is directly embedded in the HTML output without escaping.
    *   Example payload: `"><img src=i onerror=alert(document.cookie)>`

**2. Stored XSS in Article Management Module:**

*   **Root Cause:** The application doesn't sanitize input in the article management module.
*   **Weakness:**  Lack of input sanitization.
*   **Attack Vector:**  A malicious user can inject XSS payloads into article content, leading to persistent XSS attacks.
*   **Impact:** When users view the compromised articles, the stored XSS payload will execute in their browsers, potentially leading to cookie theft or other malicious actions.

**3. Reflected XSS in User Management Module:**

*   **Root Cause:** The application fails to sanitize input when searching for users. Specifically, the `userName` parameter is vulnerable.
*  **Weakness:** Lack of output sanitization on the user search results page. The application reflects user-controlled input directly into the HTML context without escaping special characters.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `userName` parameter. If a victim clicks on this link, the XSS payload is executed.
*   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to entice a victim to click on a specially crafted URL or make a user perform a search with a malicious keyword.
*   **Impact:** When the page is rendered, the JavaScript code in the payload is executed in the victim's browser. The impact can range from defacement to cookie stealing, session hijacking, or redirecting the user to malicious websites.
*   **Technical Details:**
    *   The vulnerable parameter `userName` is submitted via a `POST` request to `/tianti-module-admin/user/list`.
    *   The server-side code reflects the `userName` field back to the page in the HTML output without encoding, leading to the vulnerability.
    *   Example payload: `"><img src=i onerror=alert(document.cookie)>`

**Mitigation Advice:**

The user who reported the issue suggests implementing the following:

*   A global interceptor to inspect user requests for potential threats.
*   A global interceptor to sanitize the response by replacing special characters with HTML entities.

In summary, this content provides details on how to exploit three different types of XSS vulnerabilities within the `tianti` project and some mitigation suggestions.
