```
- Root cause of vulnerability: When a file upload is submitted to a form field with a scalar `string` type hint in its setter method, the `UploadedFile::__toString()` method is called, disclosing the full path of the uploaded file.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Information disclosure
- Impact of exploitation: Exposure of the full path of an uploaded file, potentially leading to further attacks, such as local file inclusion, which may escalate to Remote Code Execution.
- Attack vectors: Submitting a file upload to a form field that expects a string.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: Ability to submit form data, knowledge of the vulnerable form field and how it handles type hinting for setters.
