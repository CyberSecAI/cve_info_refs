Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-19082:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow in the processing of the `DNSManual.IPv4Address` parameter within the ONVIF `SetDNS` method.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121).
- Vulnerable code within the ONVIF service (`NVTService`).
- Anonymous access is allowed for the vulnerable ONVIF method.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service due to `NVTService` crashing.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution if attacker overwrites return addresses on the stack.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted ONVIF `SetDNS` request to the device's ONVIF service (typically on port 888).
- The `IPv4Address` field is supplied with a long string that overflows a buffer in stack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the vulnerable Foscam IP camera.
- No authentication is required to exploit, due to anonymous access to ONVIF.

**Technical Details:**
- The specific vulnerable function is in the `devicemgmt` `SetDNS` method.
- The overflow is triggered by a long string provided to the `IPv4Address` parameter in the `DNSManual` structure.
- The overflow overwrites the return address on the stack, leading to a crash (segmentation fault).
- The provided proof of concept uses a string of 'A' characters to demonstrate the overflow.
- The vulnerability occurs in `NVTService`, the process that handles the ONVIF commands.
- GDB output is provided to demonstrate the stack corruption and crash.

**Additional Information:**
- The report mentions it's likely there are similar crashes in other parts of the firmware, suggesting more potential buffer overflows.
- This vulnerability is confirmed in at least the "Opticam i5" device, and possibly others.
- The exploit is unauthenticated due to anonymous access being allowed for the vulnerable ONVIF method on some models.
