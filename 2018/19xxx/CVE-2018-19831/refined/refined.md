```
{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the unprotected `ToOwner` function within the ERC20 token CBN smart contract. This function allows any user to set themselves as the contract owner.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unprotected ownership transfer: The `ToOwner` function lacks proper access control, allowing anyone to call it and change the contract's owner.",
      "Missing access control modifier: The function does not use the `onlyOwner` modifier, which would normally restrict this sensitive function to the current contract owner."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can take ownership of the smart contract. Once the attacker is the owner, they can access all functions that are restricted to the owner. This typically includes critical functions such as withdrawing funds, transferring tokens and other administrative operations.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker sends a transaction to the contract to call the `ToOwner` function.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker only needs to be able to call the `ToOwner` function of the vulnerable smart contract."
  }
