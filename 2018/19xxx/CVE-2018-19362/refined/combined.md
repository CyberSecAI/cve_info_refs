Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1671096#c0)  Laura Pardo    2019-01-30 17:40:30 UTC  ``` FasterXML jackson-databind before versions 2.7.9.4, 2.8.11.2, 2.9.6 fails to block polymorphic deserialization of types from Oracle JDBC driver. This could lead to Remote Code Execution.

2019-02-14 06:32:42 UTC  ``` Whilst none of the three classes mentioned in the patch appear to be used in any of the OpenDaylight codebase I checked, we do use the Oracle JDBC driver and we do ship impacted versions of jackson-databind, so it is worth updating the dependency.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1671096#c21)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-04-17 21:01:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been

Statement:  Red Hat Satellite 6 is not affected by this issue, since Candlepin's java runtime environment does not load Oracle's JDBC classes.  Red Hat Virtualization 4 is not affected by this issue, since it does not load Oracle's JDBC classes.  Red Hat OpenStack Platform ships OpenDaylight, which contains the vulnerable jackson-databind. However, OpenDaylight does not expose jackson-databind in a way that would make it vulnerable, lowering the impact of the vulnerability for OpenDaylight. As such, Red Hat will not be providing a fix for OpenDaylight at this time.   ``` |  |

# RHSA-2019:1822 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat Decision Manager 7.4.0 Security Update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat Decision Manager.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Decision Manager is an open source decision management platform that combines business rules management, complex event processing, Decision Model & Notation (DMN) execution, and Business Optimizer for solving planning problems. It automates business decisions and makes that logic available to the entire business.

This release of Red Hat Decision Manager 7.4.0 serves as an update to Red Hat Decision Manager 7.3.1, and includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

Security Fix(es):

* jackson-databind: Potential information exfiltration with default typing, serialization gadget from MyBatis (CVE-2018-11307)
* jackson-databind: improper polymorphic deserialization of types from Jodd-db library (CVE-2018-12022)
* jackson-databind: improper polymorphic deserialization of types from Oracle JDBC driver (CVE-2018-12023)
* jackson-databind: arbitrary code execution in slf4j-ext class (CVE-2018-14718)
* jackson-databind: arbitrary code execution in blaze-ds-opt and blaze-ds-core classes (CVE-2018-14719)
* jackson-databind: improper polymorphic deserialization in axis2-transport-jms class (CVE-2018-19360)
* jackson-databind: improper polymorphic deserialization in openjpa class (CVE-2018-19361)
* jackson-databind: improper polymorphic deserialization in jboss-common-core class (CVE-2018-19362)
* jackson-databind: exfiltration/XXE in some JDK classes (CVE-2018-14720)
* jackson-databind: server-side request forgery (SSRF) in axis2-jaxws class (CVE-2018-14721)
* xstream: remote code execution due to insecure XML deserialization (CVE-2019-10173, regression of CVE-2013-7285)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

## Solution

For on-premise installations, before applying the update, back up your existing installation, including all applications, configuration files, databases and database settings, and so on.

It is recommended to halt the server by stopping the JBoss Application Server process before installing this update; after installing the update, restart the server by starting the JBoss Application Server process.

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must log in to download the update).

                 CVE-2018-14719 CVE-2018-14720 CVE-2018-14721 CVE-2018-19360
                 CVE-2018-19361 CVE-2018-19362 CVE-2019-12086

Multiple security issues were found in jackson-databind, a Java library
to parse JSON and other data formats which could result in information
disclosure or the execution of arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.8.6-1+deb9u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your jackson-databind packages.

# JBoss Fuse Integration Services on Fuse 6.3 Patch Release Notes

Updated 2020-02-24T13:47:46+00:00 -
English

* No translations currently exist.

This article provides the details around our JBoss Fuse Integration Services patches.

The intention of this article is provide the [details](#versions) on the relevant releases that you may need to apply the maintenance as well as document the associated fixes. For information on how to apply the patches, please refer to the [Patching Documentation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_fuse/6.3/html/fuse_integration_services_2.0_for_openshift/patching).

These patches may have three different components and each will detail the issues resolved:

[Application Dependency Updates](#application)

[Image Updates](#images)

[Template Updates](#templates)

Patch releases are typically driven by application dependency updates. The following table highlights the relationship between the different versions. Note images may be released outside of a major patch release and will be documented in the [Image Updates](#images) section.

# **Versions**

This section documents the versions for the different components for major patch releases.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Package        : jackson-databind
Version        : 2.4.2-2+deb8u5
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-11307 CVE-2018-12022 CVE-2018-12023 CVE-2018-14718
                 CVE-2018-14719 CVE-2018-14720 CVE-2018-14721 CVE-2018-19360
                 CVE-2018-19361 CVE-2018-19362

Several deserialization flaws were discovered in jackson-databind, a fast
and powerful JSON library for Java, which could allow an unauthenticated
user to perform code execution. The issue was resolved by extending
the blacklist and blocking more classes from polymorphic deserialization.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
2.4.2-2+deb8u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your jackson-databind packages.

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

Important notes:

* Jackson 2.11 added `MapperFeature.BLOCK_UNSAFE_POLYMORPHIC_BASE_TYPES` which can be enabled to prevent use of potentially unsafe 2.10-deprecated legacy methods: read more on “[Jackson 2.11 Features](https://medium.com/%40cowtowncoder/jackson-2-11-features-40cdc1d2bdf3)” blog post.
* Jackson 2.10 supports new “Safe Default Typing” via `activateDefaultTyping()` (instead of deprecated `enableDefaultTyping()`): read more on “[Jackson 2.10 Features](https://medium.com/%40cowtowncoder/jackson-2-10-features-cd880674d8a2)” blog post.

# Background

During 2017 many vulnerabilities based on so-called “serialization gadgets” (or just “gadgets”) were reported. Reports cover many different Java serialization frameworks and libraries, including Jackson.

Gadgets are classes that allow calling otherwise non-accessible methods or accessing non-accessible data, when instantiated and modified via setters and/or assignments to fields (necessary during reading of data into Objects, aka deserialization; or during writing of Objects as data, aka Serialization).
With proper initialization they will perform operations as side effects: operations that may for example allow remote execution of commands or scripts, or that expose data from the file system of server handling deserialization.

As a hypothetical example let’s consider class `Bomb` with method `setTimeToDetonate(int seconds)`, calling of which shuts down JVM (or Operating System) after specific delay. If serialization system allows construction of `Bomb` and calling of `setTimeToDetonate` (for example by passing property “timeToDetonate”) this is a valid attack vector for denial-of-service attack. Most gadgets require calling of one or more setter methods in specific order, and then allow either reading of a system file, execution of a command, or sometimes execution of code specified in payload (as byte code possibly encoded as Base64).

Originally research started with focus on default JDK serialization. A good overview is this article from 2015:

* <http://frohoff.github.io/appseccali-marshalling-pickles/>

which covers tools that is still being developed, updated with new exploits:

* <https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial>

# Currently Published State of the Art Gadgets

A more recent take, covering many other libraries/frameworks, can be found from:

* <https://github.com/mbechler/marshalsec>

(there’s a link to pdf presentation in README: repo itself contains sample exploit(s))

This project documents about two dozen potential, commonly available gadgets over a dozen frameworks, including Jackson. Report is good reading in general so I encourage you to read (or at least skim) it if at all interested in security aspects of Object serialization.

There is also at least one existing Jackson-specific article:

* <https://adamcaudill.com/2017/10/04/exploiting-jackson-rce-cve-2017-7525/>

which explains specific exploit applicable against Jackson quite well (if not in deep detail); but I thought it would make sense to explain exact requirements (applicability of exploit) in bit more detail because the exploit described can only be used under specific circumstances and is NOT generally available just because Jackson is being used for serialization.

# Am I Affected if I Use Jackson for JSON?

As usual, the full answer is “It Depends”. But the likely answer is “probably not”. The reason for this is that for exploit to work, multiple things must be true and commonly at least one pre-requisite is not true.

But let’s look at these pre-requisite.

# What is Required for a Jackson-based “gadget” Exploit?

Simply put, exploit can work if all of these conditions are true, if your system:

1. Accepts JSON content sent by untrusted client (composed manually or by code you did not write and have no visibility or control over) — meaning that you can not constrain JSON itself that is being sent
2. Has at least one specific “gadget” class to exploit in the Java classpath: and specifically class from these that works with Jackson (most gadgets only work with specific library or libraries — most commonly reported ones for example only work with JDK serialization)
3. Enable polymorphic type handling for properties with nominal type of `java.lang.Object` (or one of small number of “permissive” tag interfaces; `java.util.Serializable`, `java.util.Comparable`)
4. Use version of Jackson that does not (yet) block “gadget” class in question (set of published exploits grows over time so it is a race between exploits and patches)

Of these, (1) means that if you control both endpoints, this exploit is not available — but this is presumed to be the starting point since without attacker there will not be attacks (although it is worth noting that in multi-phase attack internal communication may be compromised and attacker gains access).

Point (2) simply means that some of the exploits rely on libraries that your application / service has dependencies on. Since some of “gadgets” are included in JDK itself, it is likely that you may well have at least one such type accessible.

So the main points to cover here are (3) and (4).

# What Does Polymorphic Typing Even Mean?

Let’s start with the definition of “polymorphic handling”. By default, specific types used have to be declared by POJO or caller, so you use classes like:

```
public class Person {
  public String name;
  public int age;
  public PhoneNumber phone; // embedded POJO
}
public class PhoneNumber {
  public int areaCode;
  public int local;
  // ... and so forth; not including optional getters/setters
}
```

and deserializer knows how to handle values for matching JSON values. Incoming JSON might look something like:

```
{ "name" : "Bob",
  "age" : 28.
  "phone" : {
     "areaCode" : 555,
     "local" : 1234567
  }
}
```

But in Object-Oriented Programming, you often use polymorphism: certain base type has multiple alternative implementations.
In above example we could, say, define different kinds of phone numbers (international? Cell phone?). So you could have (and yes, example is contrived — but humor me):

```
abstract class PhoneNumber {
   public int areaCode, local;
}
public class InternationalNumber extends PhoneNumber {
   public int countryCode;
}
public class DomesticNumber extends PhoneNumber { }
```

Serializing (writing out) of `Person` instances would not be problematic, as type is available and be introspected for properties. But trying to read values back would give us an exception because `Person` is an abstract type and you can not create instances of abstract types; you must use a concrete subtype. And deserializer does not know which subtype to use without further information.

Jackson can support this if we allow/require addition of “type id”: value that allows deserializer to know which subtype to create instance of. Easiest way is to use annotation `@JsonTypeInfo`, using one of two mechanisms:

```
// enable polymorphic handling for every PhoneNumber-valued property
@JsonTypeInfo(use = Id.CLASS)
// note: there are other ways to register subtypes, too
@JsonSubTypes({ InternationalNumber.class, DomesticNumber.class })
abstract class PhoneNumber {
}// or:
public class Person {
   @JsonTypeInfo(...) // only enable for this property!
   public PhoneNumber phone;
}
```

When doing this, serializer will add a type identifier in JSON (depending on configuration can be additional property, or array or object structure “wrapping” value); and deserializer, conversely, knows to expect this. We will see something like:

```
{ "phone" : {
   "@class" : "package.InternationalNumber",
   "areaCode" : 555,
   ...
  }
}
```

Note that this is just one of the options, regarding type id to include, and mechanism for inclusion. For more information on usage you may want to read:

* <http://www.baeldung.com/jackson-annotations>
* <http://programmerbruce.blogspot.com/2011/05/deserialize-json-with-jackson-into.html>
* <http://www.studytrails.com/java/json/java-jackson-serialization-polymorphism/>

The key part here is that if (and only if!) class name is used as the type id, then sender could send any class name they want to: within limits of type compatibility Jackson deserializer will (try to) create an instance of that type and initialize it by calling setter methods and/or setting values to fields.

# Another Way to Enable Polymorphic Handling in Jackson

So, this is the most common way to enable polymorphic handling for specific properties. But it requires annotating either all polymorphic value types, or all properties (or some combination thereof). This may not be practical, especially with 3rd party value types (although even in those cases it is possible to use this approach, with “mix-in” annotations).

Because of this reason, there is one other way to enable polymorphic handling: “Default Typing”.
Default typing is enabled via `ObjectMapper`:

```
ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
mapper.enableDefaultTyping(); // or one of variants
```

and what it does is equivalent to adding:

```
@JsonTypeInfo(use = Id.CLASS, include = As.WRAPPER_ARRAY)
```

on every property that matches inclusion criteria (which, by default, is `DefaultTyping.OBJECT_AND_NON_CONCRETE`). In our case it would apply this to all properties with `abstract` type value, including `PhoneNumber`.

# So Is Polymorphic Handling Always Dangerous?

So far so good. With polymorphic handling attacker can potentially produce types of values that service did not mean to allow. However, this does NOT yet mean she can use actual Gadget types — remember that type to use MUST match base type. This particular case is not yet problematic, unless you happen to find a sub-class of `PhoneNumber` that is a serialization gadget — which is unlikely (or more importantly, unlikely that attacker would know such a class is available).

So we have to make another change to declaration:

```
public class Person {
  @JsonTypeInfo(use = Id.CLASS)
  public Object phone;

Why is this important? Because all Java classes are instances of `Object`, so now attacker can select from a wide selection of documented “gadgets”. Although only from a set that works with Jackson’s setter/field assignment (some attacks only work against JDK serialization, or against other serialization frameworks).

Also note that some other “tag” types can be similarly problematic:

* `java.util.Serializable` is implemented by many types (including many Gadget classes)
* `java.util.Comparable` and `java.lang.Cloneable` are also commonly implemented by various classes

# Is There Anything Jackson Does to Protect You?

So now we know the first 3 pre-requisites for successful exploit. But there is one more requirement.

Given that there is active research to find gadget types, Jackson databind module is being updated, incrementally, to prevent use of these types.
This means, simply put, that deserialization of a set of “well-known” Gadget types is blocked: they can not be read in via polymorphic handling (or actually even with explicit type).

Since inclusion of checks requires releasing of new versions, it is important to try to keep your Jackson version as up-to-date as possible. As of February 2019, latest versions are:

* `2.8.11`
* `2.9.8`

and these have the most recent updates.

To learn more about active development, you may also want to check out issues reported:

* <https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/labels/CVE>

(note: you may want to include `closed` issues as well as open ones)

# What to do to Protect My System?

Knowing all of above, we know something about general applicability.
So here are some suggestions for further reduce likelihood of successful attacks:

1. Try to keep up with updated versions of Jackson (`jackson-databind`): it should always be safe to upgrade to the latest patch version of given minor version (safest in the sense they should be no breaking changes to functionality)
2. If possible, AVOID enabling default typing (since it is usually class name based). It is better to be explicit about specifying where polymorphism is needed.
3. AVOID using `java.lang.Object` (or, `java.util.Serializable`) as the nominal type of polymorphic values, regardless of whether you use per-type, per-property, or Default Typing
4. If possible USE “type name” and NOT classname as type id: `@JsonTypeInfo(use = Id.NAME)` — this may require annotation of type name (see `@JsonTypeName` and `@JsonSubTypes`)

Especially consider the fact that if you can do either (3) or (4), you will prevent use of this class of exploits.

# RHSA-2019:3140 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.4.8 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization is a lean data integration solution that provides easy, real-time, and unified data access across disparate sources to multiple applications and users. JBoss Data Virtualization makes data spread across physically distinct systems - such as multiple databases, XML files, and even Hadoop systems - appear as a set of tables in a local database.

This release of Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.4.8 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.4.7, and includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

Security Fix(es):

* thrift: Improper file path sanitization in t\_go\_generator.cc:format\_go\_output() of the go client library can allow an attacker to inject commands (CVE-2016-5397)
* tika-core: tika: Command injection in tika-server can allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via crafted headers (CVE-2018-1335)
* slf4j: Deserialisation vulnerability in EventData constructor can allow for arbitrary code execution (CVE-2018-8088)
* jackson-databind: Potential information exfiltration with default typing, serialization gadget from MyBatis (CVE-2018-11307)
* libthrift: thrift: Improper Access Control grants access to files outside the webservers docroot path (CVE-2018-11798)
* jackson-databind: improper polymorphic deserialization of types from Jodd-db library (CVE-2018-12022)
* jackson-databind: improper polymorphic deserialization of types from Oracle JDBC driver (CVE-2018-12023)
* jackson-databind: arbitrary code execution in slf4j-ext class (CVE-2018-14718)
* jackson-databind: arbitrary code execution in blaze-ds-opt and blaze-ds-core classes (CVE-2018-14719)
* jackson-databind: improper polymorphic deserialization in axis2-transport-jms class (CVE-2018-19360)
* jackson-databind: improper polymorphic deserialization in openjpa class (CVE-2018-19361)
* jackson-databind: improper polymorphic deserialization in jboss-common-core class (CVE-2018-19362)
* zookeeper: Information disclosure in Apache ZooKeeper (CVE-2019-0201)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
