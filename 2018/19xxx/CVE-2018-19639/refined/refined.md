{
  "CVE-2018-19639": {
    "Description": "If supportutils before version 3.1-5.7.1 is run with -v to perform rpm verification and the attacker manages to manipulate the rpm listing (e.g. with CVE-2018-19638) he can execute arbitrary commands as root.",
    "Root cause": "The `supportutils` script, when run with the `-v` flag, performs an RPM verification. An attacker can manipulate the RPM listing to inject arbitrary commands that will be executed by `supportutils` with root privileges.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation of the RPM listing",
      "Improper privilege management"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary command execution with root privileges, leading to complete compromise of the system.",
    "Attack vector": "Local",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker must be able to manipulate the RPM listing, for example, by exploiting another vulnerability such as CVE-2018-19638 or by having write access to files used by the vulnerable script. Also, the attacker needs to execute the vulnerable script with the `-v` option as root.",
      "Additional Information": "This vulnerability can be exploited in combination with CVE-2018-19638, which allows overwriting files used by supportutils to collect log files. This combination enables attackers to manipulate the rpm listing."
