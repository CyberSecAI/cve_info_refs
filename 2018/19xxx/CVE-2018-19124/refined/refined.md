Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security issues addressed in the mentioned pull requests:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies within the TinyMCE filemanager plugin used by PrestaShop. The identified issues stem from insufficient validation and checks within the file management functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Missing MIME Type Checks:** Lack of validation of uploaded file types, allowing potentially malicious files to be uploaded.
2.  **Missing `image_size` action:** A filemanager action called `image_size` was present in the plugin.
3.  **Arbitrary Image Write/Overwrite:** Vulnerability allowing images to be written or overwritten arbitrarily in Windows installations.
4.  **Directory Deletion:** The ability to delete the current image directory due to missing checks.
5. **Insecure realpath usage:** `realpath` function could be called on non-existent files/folders.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** Attackers could upload malicious files (e.g., scripts, executables) by bypassing the missing mime type checks.
*   **Image Overwriting:** Attackers could overwrite existing images, potentially defacing the site or injecting malicious content within images.
* **Denial of Service:** An attacker could delete the image directory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerabilities are accessible via the TinyMCE filemanager plugin, specifically the file upload and image management features.
*   An attacker would need access to the back office of PrestaShop to exploit these vulnerabilities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have valid credentials to access the PrestaShop back office.
*   The attacker needs to be able to access and interact with the filemanager plugin.

**Additional Information:**

*   The fixes were implemented in PrestaShop versions 1.7.4.4 and 1.6.1.23.
*   The pull requests #11285 (1.7.4.x) and #11286 (1.6.1.x) specifically addressed these vulnerabilities.
*   The fixes include:
    *   Checking MIME types during file uploads.
    *   Removing the `image_size` action.
    *   Preventing arbitrary image write/overwrite in Windows installations.
    *   Preventing the deletion of the current image directory.
    *   Checking if the file/folder exists before using `realpath`.

This detailed information provides a good understanding of the security vulnerabilities and the fixes applied.
