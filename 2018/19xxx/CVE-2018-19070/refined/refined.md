- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `usrName` parameter in the `CGIProxy.fcgi` `addAccount` functionality is directly included in a command line executed by the shell without proper sanitization or input validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Remote command injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the device with root privileges. This allows for complete compromise of the device, including adding new users, installing malware, exfiltrating data, and controlling the device's functions.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to the `CGIProxy.fcgi` endpoint with a malicious payload in the `usrName` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have network access to the device and valid administrative credentials, or to exploit a default credential vulnerability if it has not been changed.
