The provided content is related to CVE-2018-19068.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the presence of a hidden functionality that allows the manipulation of the telnet daemon (telnetd) via a specific HTTP request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Hidden Functionality (CWE-912):** The telnetd service can be enabled or disabled using HTTP requests with a specific command (`setTelnetSwitch`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   An attacker can enable the telnet service on the device.
-   This allows them to establish a remote shell session by logging in via Telnet using the devices' credentials.
-   In conjunction with other vulnerabilities (default credentials/command injection), this can lead to full device compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   Sending crafted HTTP requests to the device's web interface.
-   Specifically, the requests use the `setTelnetSwitch` command with parameters to enable or disable Telnet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   Network access to the device's web interface.
-   Either authenticated access as an administrative user OR use of the hardcoded `factory~` credentials.

**Additional details:**
- The advisory mentions that in some models this request works even with the hidden factory credentials (`factory~`/`Ak47@99`). This means that an attacker could enable telnet without needing administrative credentials.
- The advisory also includes a proof of concept demonstrating how to enable telnet:
```
Enable:
http://HOST:88/cgi-bin/CGIProxy.fcgi?usr=root&pwd=toor&cmd=setTelnetSwitch&switch=1
Disable:
http://HOST:88/cgi-bin/CGIProxy.fcgi?usr=root&pwd=toor&cmd=setTelnetSwitch&switch=0
```
