{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability arises because nbconvert responses are treated as having the same origin as the notebook server, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute malicious JavaScript within the context of the notebook server, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or performing actions on behalf of the user.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious notebook, an attacker can exploit the lack of proper origin separation when nbconvert generates responses, triggering XSS when the notebook is viewed.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to create or modify a notebook file that can be viewed by a victim user using a vulnerable jupyter-notebook server."
