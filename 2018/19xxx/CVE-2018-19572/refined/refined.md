- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition when handling symlinks in the deployed pages tree.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability arises because GitLab allows symlinks in the deployed pages tree and the symlink check can run on the previous tree while the open operation happens on the new tree, due to the pages tree being replaced with a new one.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially bypass restrictions on symlinks, by manipulating the pages tree after a symlink check has been performed, but before it is used.
- **Attack vectors:** By manipulating the pages tree after the symlink check has been performed, an attacker could potentially bypass the restrictions that are enforced on symlinks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to influence the pages tree before the symlink is opened. This likely means they would need the ability to push changes that would result in a new tree being deployed.
