{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The smart contract's `owned` function lacks proper access control, allowing anyone to call it and become the contract owner.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure direct object reference",
      "Missing access control"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can take control of the smart contract, enabling them to perform actions restricted to the owner, such as transferring all the contract's funds or tokens.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Call to the vulnerable `owned()` function directly via a transaction."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to interact with the smart contract by sending transactions."
