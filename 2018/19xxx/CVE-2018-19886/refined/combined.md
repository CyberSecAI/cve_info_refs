# faac: Denial of service — GLSA **202208-16**

A vulnerability in faac could result in denial of service.

### Affected packages

| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.30** |

### Background

faac contains free MPEG-4 audio codecs by AudioCoding.com.

### Description

An invalid pointer can be dereferenced in the huffcode function of libfaac/huff2.c, leading to a crash.

### Impact

An attacker with the ability to provide crafted input to faac could cause a denial of service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

Desovered which   flag to omit by removing one flag at a time and rerunning the make (after a   make clean).     This bug has been reproduced by royger of IRC. royger@bdftech.com ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Mark Hillary    2002-09-07 12:41:49 UTC  ``` This error occurs on a P4 using GCC3.2 installed using the 1.2 iso and the .1.4  tbz2 stage 1.  ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Dan Armak (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-09-07 16:54:13 UTC  ``` I see this is kdeaddons-3.0.3; could you please try 3.1-beta1, or even the      cvs ebuilds at www.gentoo.org/~danarmak/kde-cvs.html, to see if this is fixed      in current cvs?           Also, since you have lots f other stuff in CFLAGS, it may be that not     -march=pentium4 but the combination of it with one of the other flags is the     cause of the problem. Could you try compiling it with nothing but    -march=pentium4? (I don't know how far you got with removing flags one by one)       The solution would be to filter the flag or combination of flags in the ebuild.    If/when there's an interesting response to the bug you submitted to    bugs.kde.org (#47572 - I saw it on the kdemultimedia ml), please tell about it  here too.              ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Mark Hillary    2002-09-07 17:06:57 UTC  ``` Yes I thought it could be so of those flags as well. But I went though and  removed each one. And tryied it. It only happened with the pentium4 tag. I also  thought that it may have been caused by a previous package that had been  complied with those flags. But today on irc (just before I submitted the bug)  the name I mentioned before had the same error. He was building with  -march=pentium4 -O3 -pipe and still had the same error.    I will try the 3.1-beta builds (not really wanting cvs on my laptop :) ) once  I've got my laptop fully installed as I just wiped it. ( Got it about 2 weeks  ago and am playing ). Will post any respons from kde here. Also is it a good  idea to report this to gcc or not?  ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Dan Armak (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-09-08 03:30:24 UTC  ``` I don't think this is a gcc bug. At least, wait to see if it's fixed in beta1.  If it isn't and the kde guys don't come up with any other good explanation,  maybe then.  ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Dan Armak (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-09-08 03:45:34 UTC  ``` I think disabling sse2 would be a smaller impact on performance than disabling   march=pentium4 altogether, so I did that (only if -march=pentium4 is set of  course). Committed to cvs, please test that it does what it's supposed to do  (since I don't have a p4 handy :-)  ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Mark Hillary    2002-09-08 12:18:12 UTC  ``` I got some feed back from the kde team basicly they said its a gcc bug. I will  try the new ebuilds and beta1. But they asked me to report it to the gcc team (  so I am going to have some fun saving the temps *.i :) ). Below is what they  said      This is a gcc bug.  Please report it to the gcc developers.    thank you,    --  Neil Stevens - neil@qualityassistant.com    Not every enlighting but never mind.    ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Bjarke Istrup Pedersen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-09-09 07:11:00 UTC  ``` I have this problem to, please try it with -O2 instead of -O3 and report back. -O2 works for me, maybe it also does for you. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Mark Hillary    2002-09-11 14:00:54 UTC  ``` Hi     I've tryied the new ebuild. It works. Am going to try manually building the  source so that I can get the *.i files for the gcc team. And also to try -O2  instead of -O3. TO see what happens.     Thanks.  ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Mark Hillary    2002-09-12 13:35:43 UTC  ``` problem still occurs with -O2 instead of -O3 (built indepdant of the ebuild to  test) have submitted a gcc bug report.  ``` |  |
