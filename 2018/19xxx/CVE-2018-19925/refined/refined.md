- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of the `O_state` parameter in `member/member_order.php`. The parameter is directly concatenated into an SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection. Although there are some filters in place to remove certain characters, they are insufficient to prevent SQL injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion. In this specific instance, the attacker is able to retrieve data by using a `UNION SELECT` statement.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by manipulating the `O_state` parameter in the HTTP request when ordering via `member/member_order.php`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected application and manipulate the `O_state` parameter. They would need a valid `M_id` to target this vulnerability.
