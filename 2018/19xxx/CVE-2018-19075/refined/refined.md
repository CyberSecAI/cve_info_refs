Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2018-19075:

**Vulnerability:** Improper Access Control: Firewall (CWE-284)

**Root Cause:** The Foscam camera's firewall, designed to restrict access to the device, only protects the web user interface (ports 88 and 443). It does not restrict access to other services.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Inadequate Firewall:** The firewall implementation is limited in scope and does not block access to services like ONVIF (888), FTP (50021), RTSP (65534), and telnet (23).
*   **Information Disclosure:** The firewall implementation reveals information about credential validity. Invalid credentials result in error -2, while correct credentials behind a firewalled IP address result in error -8.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Circumvention of Access Restrictions:** Attackers can bypass the intended firewall restrictions and gain access to services that should be protected.
*   **Credential Validity Disclosure:** An attacker can use the firewall's response to determine if credentials are valid, aiding in brute-force attacks or other unauthorized access attempts.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** An attacker can exploit this by attempting to access the device from a network location that is supposed to be blocked by the firewall. They can then connect to open services like FTP or RTSP, or the web interface using an alternate port.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the device. This could be from the local network or through a connection through a device exposed to the internet.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The document provides more detail than the standard CVE description, outlining the specific services that bypass the firewall and the information disclosure vulnerability.
*   The content links the vulnerability to CVE-2018-19074 and also states that the credential validity disclosure is specific to CVE-2018-19075.
