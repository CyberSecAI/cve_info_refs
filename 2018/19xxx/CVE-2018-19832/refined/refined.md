{
  "related": true,
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a mismatch between the contract name and the constructor function name in the smart contract. This mismatch results in the constructor becoming a public function, allowing anyone to call it and set themselves as the owner.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrectly named constructor function",
      "Public function used as constructor",
       "Unprotected ownership transfer"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can take ownership of the smart contract. Once the attacker gains ownership, they can perform sensitive operations restricted by the `onlyOwner` modifier, such as transferring all the tokens.",
    "attack_vectors": "By invoking the incorrectly named constructor function, which is publicly accessible, an attacker can set themselves as the owner of the contract.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a transaction to the smart contract to invoke the vulnerable constructor function."
