Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-19012:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Improper Privilege Management: The vulnerability stems from the ability to break out of the kiosk mode of the Dräger Infinity Delta patient monitor's operating system via a specific dialog.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management:** The system fails to properly restrict user privileges, allowing an attacker to bypass the intended kiosk mode and gain access to the underlying operating system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full System Compromise:** Successfully breaking out of the kiosk mode allows an attacker to take complete control of the operating system. This grants the attacker the ability to potentially:
    *   Access sensitive data.
    *   Modify system configurations.
    *   Install malicious software.
    *   Disrupt device functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the device, as the vulnerability is exploited through a specific dialog within the device's interface.
*   **User Interaction:** While the attack does not require the user to perform any specific action, it is performed by interacting with the user interface of the device (specific dialog).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Access:** The attacker needs to have physical access to the Dräger Infinity Delta device to exploit this vulnerability, which implies being at the location of the device.
*   **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker requires knowledge of the specific dialog that allows for breaking out of the kiosk mode but does not require a high level of technical skills.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions a CVSS v3 base score of 8.4 for this vulnerability with a vector string of (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
*   The vulnerability was reported by Marc Ruef and Rocco Gagliardi, of scip AG.
*   Dräger has released fixes for this vulnerability in December 2018 via Delta/Infinity Explorer VF10.1 software releases
*   The advisory indicates that this vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.
