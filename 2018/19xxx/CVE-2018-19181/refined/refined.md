The provided content details two vulnerabilities in yunucms V1.1.5:

**1. Arbitrary File Deletion**

*   **Root cause:** The `remove()` function in `/statics/ueditor/php/vendor/Local.class.php` uses the `$_POST['key']` value directly in an `unlink()` call without proper sanitization or authentication.
*   **Weakness:**  Lack of input sanitization and authentication allows arbitrary file deletion. The code attempts a basic directory check (`$pathlist[0] != 'uploads' && $pathlist[1] != 'uploads'`) but is insufficient to prevent path traversal.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can delete arbitrary files on the server.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a POST request to `/statics/ueditor/php/controller.php?action=remove` with the `key` parameter set to a path pointing to the file to be deleted.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the server.

**2. Remote Code Execution via Installation Process**

*   **Root cause:** After deleting `/data/install.lock` (using the first vulnerability), the attacker can initiate a new installation process. The installer takes user input for the database prefix (`DB_PREFIX`) and writes it into the database configuration file (`config/database.php`). Insufficient input sanitization when writing this value allows the injection of arbitrary PHP code.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of sanitization when writing the DB_PREFIX value in the function `setConfigfile` in `/app/admin/common.php`. Specifically, it does not properly escape single quotes which allows for injection.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server by injecting PHP code into the `DB_PREFIX` field during the installation process. This results in RCE via the modified config file.
*   **Attack vector:**
    1.  Exploit the arbitrary file deletion vulnerability to remove `/data/install.lock`.
    2.  Initiate the installation process.
    3.  Provide malicious PHP code within the `DB_PREFIX` field during installation.
    4.  Trigger the execution of the injected code by accessing the web application.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server, and be able to remove files via the arbitrary file deletion vulnerability.
