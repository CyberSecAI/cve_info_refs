## Description

[![@jsegitz](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7304749?u=a55e91d427a43e88a25ed8480040a648d1171842&v=4&size=48)](/jsegitz)[jsegitz](https://github.com/jsegitz)opened [on Oct 25, 2018](https://github.com/acassen/keepalived/issues/1048#issue-373998967)

Users can overwrite arbitrary files if PrintData or PrintStats is invoked and fs.protected\_symlinks is 0

Reproducer:

As user:

```
johannes@linux-v0tl:~> ls -lah /passwd
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2.9K Oct 25 16:47 /passwd
johannes@linux-v0tl:~> head -n 1 /passwd
at:x:25:25:Batch jobs daemon:/var/spool/atjobs:/bin/bash
johannes@linux-v0tl:~> ln -s /passwd /tmp/keepalived.data

```

As root:

```
# fs.protected_symlinks=0
# busctl call org.keepalived.Vrrp1 /org/keepalived/Vrrp1/Vrrp org.keepalived.Vrrp1.Vrrp  PrintData
# head -n1 /passwd
------< Global definitions >------

```

/tmp/keepalived.data and /tmp/keepalived.stats is also created mode 666, so information can leak/be modified to/by unprivileged users

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

When opening files for write, ensure they aren't symbolic links

```
Issue [#1048](https://github.com/acassen/keepalived/issues/1048) identified that if, for example, a non privileged user
created a symbolic link from /etc/keepalvied.data to /etc/passwd,
writing to /etc/keepalived.data (which could be invoked via DBus)
would cause /etc/passwd to be overwritten.

This commit stops keepalived writing to pathnames where the ultimate
component is a symbolic link, by setting O_NOFOLLOW whenever opening
a file for writing.

This might break some setups, where, for example, /etc/keepalived.data
was a symbolic link to /home/fred/keepalived.data. If this was the case,
instead create a symbolic link from /home/fred/keepalived.data to
/tmp/keepalived.data, so that the file is still accessible via
/home/fred/keepalived.data.

There doesn't appear to be a way around this backward incompatibility,
since even checking if the pathname is a symbolic link prior to opening
for writing would create a race condition.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c0)  Marcus Rückert   2016-12-12 14:19:11 UTC  ``` I would like to enable dbus support in keepalived. which atm is blocked by the rpmlintrc check.  Code: <https://github.com/acassen/keepalived/>  Service file: <https://github.com/acassen/keepalived/blob/master/keepalived/dbus/org.keepalived.Vrrp1.conf>  any objections? ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c2)  Johannes Segitz   2017-03-30 14:34:37 UTC  ``` Making the bug private to the discuss the issues found.  1, Heap overflow when parsing HTTP responses  extract_status_code extracts the HTTP status codes from monitored servers.          /* Allocate the room */         buf_code = (char *)MALLOC(10);          /* Status-Code extraction */         while (buffer < end && *buffer++ != ' ') ;         begin = buffer;         while (buffer < end && *buffer++ != ' ')                 inc++;         strncat(buf_code, begin, inc);  So if the status code is longer then 9 bytes we run into a problem here.   *** Error in `/usr/sbin/keepalived': free(): invalid pointer: 0x00000000006a76c0 *** ======= Backtrace: =========

I'll try again with github issues and then we can close this ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c6)  Johannes Segitz   2018-10-24 14:07:01 UTC  ``` (In reply to Johannes Segitz from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c2)) The issue is fixed upstream in f28015671a4b04785859d1b4b1327b367b6a10e9 ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c7)  Johannes Segitz   2018-10-25 15:11:59 UTC  ``` I found two other issues. One isn't exploitable since it's caught by by dbus itself. The other is the ability to overwrite arbitrary files if  PrintData or PrintStats is invoked and fs.protected_symlinks=0 (default 1 for our products)  Reproducer:  user: johannes@linux-v0tl:~> ls -lah /passwd -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2.9K Oct 25 16:47 /passwd johannes@linux-v0tl:~> head -n 1 /passwd at:x:25:25:Batch jobs daemon:/var/spool/atjobs:/bin/bash johannes@linux-v0tl:~> ln -s /passwd /tmp/keepalived.data  root: # fs.protected_symlinks=0 # busctl call org.keepalived.Vrrp1 /org/keepalived/Vrrp1/Vrrp org.keepalived.Vrrp1.Vrrp  PrintData # head -n1 /passwd ------< Global definitions >------  /tmp/keepalived.data and /tmp/keepalived.stats is also created mode 666, so information can leak/be modified to/by unprivileged users. I'll create an upstream issue. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c8)  Johannes Segitz   2018-10-25 15:17:16 UTC  ``` Tracked in  <https://github.com/acassen/keepalived/issues/1048>  I would like to invest a little bit more time here (is also a good learning opportunity for dbus for me) ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c9)  Johannes Segitz   2018-10-26 08:23:57 UTC  ``` overall I'm not sure we want to enable this. There's not much defense in depth in there. E.g. set_valid_path in keepalived/vrrp/vrrp_dbus.c will happily overflow while creating a valid_path because it only checks that the input string still has characters, not if there's still space in the output buffer. Can't be exploited directly since handle_method_call checks the size, but it would be nice to have the check in the function that created the path, so it can't be forgotten if it's reused somewhere else. Lets see if I find more ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c10)  Johannes Segitz   2018-11-06 16:43:55 UTC  ``` (In reply to Johannes Segitz from [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c8)) The issue was fixed upstream and I'll request a CVE id for it  @Darix: So with that I would be willing to whitelist this if you still need the functionality. Is this the case? ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c11)  Marcus Rückert   2018-11-07 13:50:24 UTC  ``` Yes please ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c12)  Johannes Segitz   2018-11-08 08:03:31 UTC  ``` (In reply to Johannes Segitz from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c7)) I asked MITRE for a CVE and they assigned three: CVE-2018-19044 for <https://github.com/acassen/keepalived/commit/04f2d32871bb3b11d7dc024039952f2fe2750306> CVE-2018-19045 for <https://github.com/acassen/keepalived/commit/c6247a9ef2c7b33244ab1d3aa5d629ec49f0a067>, <https://github.com/acassen/keepalived/commit/5241e4d7b177d0b6f073cfc9ed5444bf51ec89d6> CVE-2018-19046 for the case, that a user already created /tmp/keepalived.data or /tmp/keepalived.stats with mode 666, so it's not covered by the umask fix and should still be fixed ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c13)  Johannes Segitz   2018-11-08 08:29:54 UTC  ``` Once the issues are fixed I'll add the whitelist entry for the dbus service ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c14)  Johannes Segitz   2018-11-08 10:22:45 UTC  ``` making public so it can be used as CVE reference ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c15)  Swamp Workflow Management   2018-11-08 15:50:05 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1015141) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/647347> Factory / rpmlint ``` [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c16)  Johannes Segitz   2018-11-09 07:36:46 UTC  ``` (In reply to Johannes Segitz from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c6)) This was assigned CVE-2018-19115. ``` [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c17)  Johannes Segitz   2018-11-12 16:25:48 UTC  ``` (In reply to Johannes Segitz from [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c12)) CVE-2018-19046 is fixed by ac8e2ef, 26c8d63 and 17f9441 ``` [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c18)  Marcus Meissner   2018-11-12 19:03:01 UTC  ``` what files can you modified that are mode 666>?   what can be doen with the content? ``` [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c19)  Johannes Segitz   2018-11-13 07:45:24 UTC  ``` (In reply to Marcus Meissner from [comment #18](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c18)) /tmp/keepalived.data or /tmp/keepalived.stats could have been created with e.g. mode 666, so the umask fix doesn't work. This allows for exposure of the information in there or it can be changed by an attacker ``` [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1015141#c20)  Andreas Stieger   2018-12-14 10:38:32 UTC  ``` Christian, your submitted maintenance update to 2.0.10 from 1.4.1/1.2.15 seems to be quite a big one. I would expect that such as update may cause existing installations to fail during a simple update, e.g. when configuration directives change or new mandatory options are introduced.

Issue [#1048](https://github.com/acassen/keepalived/issues/1048) identified that files created by keepalived are created
with mode 0666. This commit changes the default to 0644, and also
allows the umask to be specified in the configuration or as a command
line option.
