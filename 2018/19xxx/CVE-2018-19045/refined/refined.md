{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The D-Bus interface in Keepalived allows for writing to arbitrary files due to insecure file handling when PrintData or PrintStats functions are invoked.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure file handling",
      "Use of symbolic links without proper checks",
      "Creation of files with insecure permissions (mode 666)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files with the privileges of the user running the application. Information disclosure can occur due to insecure file permissions, and such files can be modified by unprivileged users.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local exploitation via the D-Bus interface",
       "Exploiting the PrintData or PrintStats function when fs.protected_symlinks is set to 0"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "Local user access to the system, ability to invoke the PrintData or PrintStats D-Bus methods.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability can be triggered by creating a symbolic link to a sensitive file, such as /etc/passwd, and then invoking the vulnerable D-Bus functions. This would overwrite the linked file with keepalived output. Additionally, the created /tmp/keepalived.data and /tmp/keepalived.stats files are created with insecure mode 666, allowing information leakage or modification by other users."
