Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-19072:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Incorrect permission assignment for a critical resource.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `/mnt/mtd/app` directory, which contains software archives that are extracted to RAM at boot time, has world-writable permissions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Any local user can replace the software archives within the `/mnt/mtd/app` directory. These archives are extracted at boot, allowing an attacker to gain root privileges by injecting malicious code into the extracted software. This leads to a full compromise of the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability, i.e., the attacker must have some form of shell access to the device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a local user account and the ability to write to the file system of the device. This can be achieved by exploiting other vulnerabilities like the default credentials or remote command execution vulnerabilities.

**Additional Details:**
- The directory `/mnt/mtd/app` contains tar.xz archives (e.g., `www.tar.xz`, `zbin.tar.xz`, `zlib.tar.xz`, `zmodules.tar.xz`) that are extracted at boot time. Replacing these archives will result in the execution of malicious code.
- This vulnerability allows for persistent compromise because the changes made to the directory and its contents will persist across device reboots.
