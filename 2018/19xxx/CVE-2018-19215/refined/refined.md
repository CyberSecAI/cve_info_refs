  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2018-19215",
    "description": "Netwide Assembler (NASM) 2.14rc16 has a heap-based buffer over-read in expand_mmac_params in asm/preproc.c for the special cases of the % and $ and ! characters.",
    "affected_versions": [
      "2.14rc16"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a heap-based buffer over-read within the `expand_mmac_params` function, specifically when handling `%`, `$`, and `!` characters during macro expansion.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer over-read"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) due to a crash. The over-read might also allow for information disclosure since the attacker can read from arbitrary memory locations.",
    "attack_vector": "The vulnerability is triggered by processing a crafted input file with specific macro usages.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted input file to trigger the vulnerability. No special privileges are required, user interaction is required to process the malicious file with the vulnerable application."
