Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2018-19365:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Wowza Streaming Engine Manager application allows unauthorized access to the local file system due to insufficient input validation in the `logName` parameter of the `/enginemanager/server/logs/download` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `logName` parameter, allowing attackers to traverse the directory structure using relative path specifiers like `../`.
*   **Local File Inclusion:** By manipulating the `logName` parameter, attackers can include and download arbitrary files from the server's file system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can retrieve sensitive files from the server, such as `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow`, potentially leading to credential theft and further system compromise.
*   **Denial of Service:** While the provided information does not explicitly detail how DoS would occur, the vendor acknowledged DoS as a potential impact, likely due to the strain of processing large or numerous file requests.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a crafted HTTP request to the `/enginemanager/server/logs/download` endpoint.
*   **Specifically Crafted REST API Call:** The attacker must manipulate the `logName` parameter of the REST API call to include directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../../../../../etc/shadow`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Wowza Streaming Engine server.
*   **Authentication (Initial):** The attacker needs to authenticate with an administrator account. However, the content mentions a default administrator account with commonly known or easily guessed passwords, making this a relatively low hurdle.
