    "description": "In supportutils, before version 3.1-5.7.1 and if pacemaker is installed on the system, an unprivileged user could have overwritten arbitrary files in the directory that is used by supportutils to collect the log files.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `supportutils` script, when Pacemaker is installed, extracts files from a tar archive created by an unprivileged user into the log directory. This extraction process doesn't validate file paths and can overwrite existing files.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Path Traversal",
        "Improper Input Validation"

      "impact": "An unprivileged user can overwrite arbitrary files within the log directory, potentially leading to denial of service, data modification, or other unexpected behavior.",
      "attack_vector": "Local access",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create a tar archive and place it in a location where the supportutils script scans for hb_report files and needs a local user account on the target system to create these tar archives."

  "CVE-2018-19637": {
    "description": "Supportutils, before version 3.1-5.7.1, wrote data to static file /tmp/supp_log, allowing local attackers to overwrite files on systems without symlink protection",
     "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `supportutils` script uses a static file path `/tmp/supp_log` for logging. This allows a local attacker to create a symbolic link to another file, thus redirecting the log output to that file.",

         "Static File Path",
          "Symlink Race Condition"

    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `supportutils` script, when executed with the `-v` option, performs RPM verification by processing a list of files.
