```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `ConnPoolName` parameter, in the `/VPortal/mgtconsole/UserPopupAddNewProp.jsp` page. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the page.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL with a payload in the `ConnPoolName` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to convince a user to click on a malicious link or visit a compromised page with the malicious URL. No special privileges are needed on the target system itself."
