{
  "cveId": "CVE-2018-19882",
  "description": "The svg_run_image function in svg/svg-run.c in Artifex MuPDF 1.14.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via a crafted svg file.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability is caused by a missing check for the existence of the 'xlink:href' attribute in the `svg_run_image` function within `svg-run.c`. If this attribute is absent in an image tag within the SVG file, the function attempts to dereference a NULL pointer when trying to access the attribute, leading to a crash.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "NULL pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service. The application crashes when processing a crafted SVG file.",
    "attackVectors": "By providing a specially crafted SVG file lacking the 'xlink:href' attribute within an image tag to a vulnerable application utilizing the MuPDF library.",
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted SVG file to the vulnerable application, possibly through a file upload or by tricking the user into opening the file.",
    "additionalDetails": "The vulnerable code snippet is:\n\n```c\n char *href_att = fz_xml_att(root, \"xlink:href\");\n\n if (!strncmp(href_att, jpeg_uri, strlen(jpeg_uri)))\n                data = href_att + strlen(jpeg_uri);\n```\n\nIf `href_att` is NULL because `xlink:href` is missing from the SVG, the `strncmp` will cause a NULL pointer dereference."
