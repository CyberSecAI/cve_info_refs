Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-19664:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of certain JPEG images within libjpeg-turbo.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow in the `put_pixel_rows` function within `wrbmp.c`. Specifically, a read operation of size 1 byte occurs at an address outside the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- According to the Ubuntu security notice, an attacker could potentially use this issue to expose sensitive information.
- The github issue provides more details; the vulnerability leads to a heap buffer overflow and program crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted JPEG image.
- The `djpeg` utility with the `-bmp` option and `-colors 256` flag is used to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious JPEG image to a vulnerable application using libjpeg-turbo.
- The attacker needs to be in a position where they can cause the vulnerable application to process the malicious image, either through local or remote vectors.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is in the `wrbmp.c` file, specifically line 145 of the `put_pixel_rows` function.
- The vulnerability was discovered using AddressSanitizer, indicating a memory corruption issue.
- The issue was reported with a sample command to reproduce the crash.
- This vulnerability was fixed in libjpeg-turbo version `2.0.1-0ubuntu2.2` for Ubuntu 19.04, `1.5.2-0ubuntu5.18.04.3` for Ubuntu 18.04, and `1.4.2-0ubuntu3.3` for Ubuntu 16.04
- The github issue #305 indicates that the vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow during the write out stage.
