- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of the 'include' directive within the `/public/login.htm` file, which allows an attacker to override attributes and include arbitrary files. Specifically, an attacker can include and execute the `/api/addusers` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Authentication Bypass: The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to bypass the normal authentication process.
    - Improper Authorization: An attacker can create new users with read-write privileges, including administrators, without proper authorization.
    - Local File Inclusion (LFI): The vulnerability allows an attacker to include and execute arbitrary files from the server.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Remote unauthenticated attackers can create users with administrative privileges.
    - This can lead to complete control of the PRTG Network Monitor system.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Remote access over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable PRTG Network Monitor instance. No prior authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
