Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities described, which are related to resource exhaustion attacks on Proof-of-Stake (PoS) cryptocurrencies:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The primary root cause is inadequate validation of network data (specifically, block headers and blocks) in PoS implementations before committing resources like RAM and disk space. This is exacerbated by the "headers-first" feature adopted from Bitcoin where block propagation was split into two separate messages, Block and Header.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Lack of Coinstake Validation (Vulnerability #1):**
    -   Some cryptocurrencies fail to check the coinstake transaction at all before storing a block header in RAM or a block on disk. This is because the coinstake transaction is present only in the Block but not the Header, and nodes store the header directly to memory.
    -   This vulnerability affects nodes using the “header-first” feature, where nodes first receive headers, and then request the full block. Since the coinstake transaction is part of the block, not the header, a node cannot validate the header on its own, leading to storing invalid headers.

2.  **Incomplete Coinstake Validation (Vulnerability #2):**
    -   Some cryptocurrencies only check if the output being spent exists in the main chain’s transaction database (TxDB), but *not* if it’s unspent.
    -   Additionally, even when validating a block on a fork of the main chain, the coinstake transaction is validated against the TxDB for the main chain itself.

3.  **Stake Amplification:**
    -   Attackers can use self-spending transactions to create multiple outputs and amplify their apparent stake. These outputs can be used in the incomplete validation process of PoS blocks to create bogus blocks. The incomplete validation allows spent outputs to be considered valid for mining.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Resource Exhaustion (RAM Attack):**
    -   Attackers can flood a victim's RAM with bogus block headers, leading to a crash due to memory exhaustion.
    -   This attack is possible against implementations that store block headers in memory without validating the coinstake transaction.
2. **Resource Exhaustion (Disk Attack):**
    - Attackers can fill a victim’s disk with invalid blocks which can lead to the node crashing. This attack is arguably more severe since manual intervention is required to clean up the disk.
3. **Chain Split Risk:** Mitigations such as adding partial validation or checkpoints can introduce the possibility of chain splits, where honest nodes end up on different forks of the blockchain due to various reasons such as network connectivity issues or malicious attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Network-based:
    -   The attacker connects to a victim node as a peer.
    -   The attacker sends a series of malformed headers or blocks to the victim node.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1. **No Stake Required (for RAM/Disk Exhaustion Attacks):**
    -   The attacker does not need to have any stake in the cryptocurrency to execute the RAM or Disk exhaustion attack.
2. **Minimal Stake Required (for Spent Stake Attack):**
   - The spent stake attack requires the attacker to have some stake to start the stake amplification process. The stake can be minimal.
3. **Network Connectivity:**
    -   The attacker needs the ability to connect to victim nodes on the network.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The attacks exploit the fact that PoS validation is more complex than PoW validation and that the existing implementations have not adequately addressed this.
*   Mitigation strategies include detecting abnormal behavior from peers, implementing partial validation of blocks, and using UTXO snapshots. However, some mitigations can come with risks such as chain splits.
*   The researchers performed a coordinated disclosure of these vulnerabilities to several cryptocurrency development teams.
* The content includes details of the attacks, including the algorithms used, and results of testing the attack.
