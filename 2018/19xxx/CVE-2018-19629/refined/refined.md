- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Sending a specific TCP stream to port 6000 of the ImageNow Perceptive Content Server triggers a crash.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The server software doesn't handle the specific crafted TCP stream ("TNMP....TNME....") correctly, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The service crashes, leading to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based. An attacker sends the crafted TCP stream to the vulnerable server's port 6000.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server, and the ability to send TCP packets to port 6000. The attacker does not need any authentication.
