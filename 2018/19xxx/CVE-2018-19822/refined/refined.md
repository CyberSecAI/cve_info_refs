Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2018-19822:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.
- The `ConnPoolName` and `GroupId` parameters within the "/VPortal/mgtconsole/SharedCriteria.jsp" page are vulnerable to reflected XSS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- This could lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, and redirection to malicious websites.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is carried out via a specially crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code within the vulnerable parameters (`ConnPoolName` and `GroupId`).
- The attacker would need to trick the victim into clicking the malicious link, typically through phishing or social engineering.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload.
- The attacker would need to find a way to deliver the malicious URL to the victim (e.g., email, chat, malicious link on a website).

**Technical details:**
- Vulnerable page: `/VPortal/mgtconsole/SharedCriteria.jsp`
