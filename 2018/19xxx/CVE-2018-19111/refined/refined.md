Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Google Cardboard Android and iOS applications were sending sensitive device information to a third-party analytics site (Unity 3D Stats) without encryption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unencrypted Communication:** The primary weakness is the lack of encryption when transmitting device information to the third-party server. This exposes the data to interception.
- **Information Disclosure:** The application was leaking potentially sensitive information such as:
    - OS version
    - CPU architecture
    - Graphics chip vendor & version
    - CPU count
    - RAM
    - VRAM
    - Screen size
    - Device make and model

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privacy Violation:** An attacker monitoring network traffic could capture sensitive information about a user's device without their knowledge. This information could potentially be used for targeted attacks or profiling.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Sniffing/Interception:** The attack vector is passive network interception (e.g., man-in-the-middle attack) by an attacker who has access to the network traffic of the user's device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to monitor network traffic between the user's device and the third-party server. This could be achieved by being on the same network (e.g., public Wi-Fi) or by compromising a network device involved in the communication.
- No special permissions or user interaction is needed to trigger the vulnerability. The data is sent automatically.

**Additional Details:**
- The affected versions were Android version 1.8, iOS version 1.2 and below.
- The vulnerability was reported to Google on May 9, 2017, and they acknowledged the issue and worked on fixing it.
- The vulnerability was present as of November 1, 2018.
