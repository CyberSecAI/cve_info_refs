      "Description": "In Wireshark 2.6.0 to 2.6.4 and 2.4.0 to 2.4.10, the MMSE dissector could go into an infinite loop. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-mmse.c by preventing length overflows."
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root cause": "The MMSE dissector in Wireshark had a flaw that could cause an infinite loop due to insufficient checks on packet lengths, specifically not preventing length overflows during dissection.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation",
        "Infinite loop"
      ],
      "Impact": "A malformed MMSE packet can trigger an infinite loop in the Wireshark dissection process, leading to denial of service (excessive CPU resource consumption) for the machine running Wireshark. This could be triggered by network injection or by reading a malicious pcap.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Network injection of malformed packets",
        "Reading malicious pcap file"
      ],
