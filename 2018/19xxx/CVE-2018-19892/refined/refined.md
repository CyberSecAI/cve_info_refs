Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding in the `/admin/dw/add-server.php` page, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before storing it in the database. This allows an attacker to inject JavaScript code into fields such as `DisplayName`, `HostName`, `UserName`, and `notes`. This malicious script is then executed in the browsers of other users when they view the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to:
  - Stealing cookies and session tokens.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the victim.
  - Redirecting the victim to malicious websites.
  - Defacing the web page.
  - Performing other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack is performed through the web interface of the application.
- **Malicious Input:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the input fields of the `/admin/dw/add-server.php` page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the `/admin/dw/add-server.php` page.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Input Fields:** The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable input fields (`DisplayName`, `HostName`, `UserName`, `notes`).
- **Ability to Inject Code:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious payload for injection.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in DomainMOD version 4.11.01.
- The provided example payload is `<img src=x onerror=alert("Xssed-By-Abdul-Raheem")>`.

This vulnerability is a Stored XSS, making it a high risk as the malicious script is persisted and affects all users who view the affected page.
