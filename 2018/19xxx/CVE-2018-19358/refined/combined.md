# Keyring Crack PoC

Keyring-crack is a PoC code for cracking gnome-keyring that is widely used in Gnome based Linux.

Currently, google-chrome employs the keyring as a default password-manager and then some packages including network-manager and gnome-online-accounts.

# How to build

You require the following to build keyring-crack:

* libsecret-1-dev

# Demo video

* Let's do crack gnome-keyring

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1652194#c0)  Laura Pardo    2018-11-21 16:30:37 UTC  ``` GNOME Keyring through 3.28.2 allows local users to retrieve login credentials via a Secret Service API call and the D-Bus interface if the keyring is unlocked, a similar issue to [CVE-2008-7320](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-7320). One perspective is that this occurs because available D-Bus protection mechanisms (involving the busconfig and policy XML elements) are not used.    References: [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-keyring/+bug/1780365](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/gnome-keyring/%2Bbug/1780365)   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1652194#c1)  Laura Pardo    2018-11-21 16:31:05 UTC  ``` Created gnome-keyring tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1652195](show_bug.cgi?id=1652195 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2018-19358 gnome-keyring: login credentials retrieval via a Secret Service API call [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1652194#c2)  Debarshi Ray    2018-11-22 15:02:56 UTC  ``` Sorry, this is an invalid bug. There's no difference between this and a scp command that uploads your GPG and SSH private keys or any private file from the disk somewhere across the Internet.  Issues like this are mitigated by encapsulating untrusted applications in Flatpaks.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1652194#c3)  Riccardo Schirone    2018-12-06 10:41:21 UTC  ``` Except that SSH/GPG keys should be passphrase-protected so even if you upload the files somewhere, your secrets are still safe.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1652194#c4)  Debarshi Ray    2018-12-06 13:28:02 UTC  ``` Except "should be" isn't the same as "are always", and there's no reason why my personal photo collection or my bank statements aren't as senstive as my SSH/GPG keys or random passwords on random websites.  And don't even get me started about the possibility that any process can hold me hostage by threatening to 'rm -rf' my whole $HOME directory.  And no, this gnome-keyring libsecret issue isn't the only example of such a thing.  This CVE is a joke. It's not like somebody has found something hitherto unknown. Far from it. These issues have been known and understood for years. You are very unlikely to get a single patch that fixes it.  The solution, as I said so before, is to migrate applications to Flatpaks with portals acting as well-defined user-controlled gateways to accessing hardware peripherals, files, etc..   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1652194#c5)  Ray Strode [halfline]    2018-12-06 13:42:53 UTC  ``` agreed this is not a security problem.  see my analysis on <https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-keyring/issues/5>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1652194#c6)  Riccardo Schirone    2018-12-10 13:54:04 UTC  ``` I think this is still a security issue. Not an easy one, nor one where there's a single patch that can fix everything, but it's a design issue and somehow it should be solved in the future.  However, we can dispute this particular CVE for the reasons mentioned by both of you, debarshir and rstrode. Mainly because a malicious app can already do all sorts of things.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1652194#c7)  Riccardo Schirone    2018-12-10 14:02:46 UTC  ``` Marking this flaw as NOTABUG because that is not an issue in gnome-keyring itself, but a design problem in the Linux desktop. There is no current way (except using Flatpak, sandbox, containers, etc.) to separate user applications from each other, so a malicious application could look at all your files, remove them, attach to other user processes to inspect their memory, etc. D-Bus protection mechanisms are not an option because applications could identify themselves as different applications with various mechanisms.

See the Bugzilla link for more details.   ``` |  |

One perspective is that this occurs because available D-Bus protection mechanisms (involving the busconfig and policy XML elements) are not used.

# [CVE-2018-19358] Credentials located in gnome-keyring can be compromised easily.

Dear all,

I figure out that login credentials, located in gnome-keyring, can be easily compromised.

Linux based on Gnome basically uses ‘gnome-keyring’ as their backend to store login credentials in a secure manner. Specifically, google-chrome browser, network-manager and gnome-online-accounts use this as a backend solution to store login credentials.

To use this, authentication is performed together with gnome-keyring as part of ‘pam-gnome-keyring.so’. At this point, it remains unlocked until system is shut down or logged out. In this state, a simple program that uses ‘Secret Service API’ call and their ‘D-Bus’ interface can easily retrieve login credentials from those gnome-keyring without any privilege escalation, listening into the X events going to another window, or installation an application on target computer.
(please check PoC source <https://github.com/sungjungk/keyring_crack> and video <https://youtu.be/Do4E9ZQaPck>)

The issue is different from the content shown on the Ubuntu Security FAQ and GnomeKeyring Wiki [1][2]. It was even said that “PAM session is closed via the screensaver, all keyrings are locked, and the ‘login’ keyring is unlocked upon successful authentication to the screensaver”. After trying to crack the keyring, it was far from what they really thought. It is no different than plain text file for login credentials somewhere on disk.

To deal with, the root cause of the problem is that ‘Secret Service API’ on anyone can be easily accessed on DBus API. If access control is enabled, only well-known? or authorized processes, such as google-chrome, network-manager, and gnome-online-accounts, will be able to access the login credentials.

DBus originally provides capability that is essential to access control of DBus API by defining security policy as a form of \*.conf file. Currently, various services based on DBus interface are employing above security policy feature to perform access control. For example, login/system related functions is controlled from ‘login1’ and its security policy is described in “org.freedesktop.login1.conf”. (see <https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/master/src/core/org.freedesktop.systemd1.conf>)

Likewise, why don’t we try adopting the access control of secret service API into gnome-keyring environment?

Due to the fact that a process with root privilege can access “.conf” file, an approved program may only update the target file during installation process

Here is really simple ‘org.freedesktop.secrets.conf’ example.

```

<?xml version="1.0"?> <!--*-nxml-*-->
<!DOCTYPE busconfig PUBLIC "-//freedesktop//DTD D-BUS Bus Configuration 1.0//EN"
        "http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/dbus/1.0/busconfig.dtd">

	<policy context="default">

					receive_interface="org.freedesktop.Secret.Item"
					receive_member="GetSecret"/>

		<!-- allow access to seahorse application (formerly keyring manager) -->
		<allow receive_sender="org.gnome.seahorse.Application"
					receive_interface="org.freedesktop.Secret.Item"

I know about that, but the problem is more serious than what I initially thought.

Existing issues have focused primarily on the behavior of seahorse and simply expect to prompt for a password before displaying a key’s plaintext password.

Moreover, countermeasures in Ubuntu Security FAQ is not appropriate for the problem and it doesn’t work like that.

The underlying problem has not been solved yet.

Instead, I would like to propose a different method by using access control scheme provided by DBus internal. Existing other services based on DBus are already taking advantage of the technique, as I mentioned above posting.

For your information, a similar issue of keychain in MAC OSX has been reported and already solved using access control technique (please check the related paper “Cracking App Isolation on Apple: Unauthorized Cross-App Resource Access on MAC OS~X and iOS, ACM CCS 2015).

I know about that, but the problem is more serious than what I initially thought.
Existing issues have focused primarily on the behavior of seahorse and simply expect to prompt for a password before displaying a key’s plaintext password.

Thank you for reporting this bug. The access via DBus when the keyring is unlocked is a well-known issue and the design of the feature as explained when reading the entirety of <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/FAQ#gnome-keyring>. Users who prefer to be prompted can choose to use a separate keyring than the one that is automatically unlocked upon successful login.

That said, I'm not clear if you are saying that the keyring is not locked during screensaver or logout. If either of these is the case, that sounds like a bug. Can you confirm and detail your methodology?
