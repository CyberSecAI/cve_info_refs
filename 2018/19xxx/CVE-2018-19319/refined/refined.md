- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing CSRF protection on two POST methods in the application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) vulnerabilities. Specifically, two POST methods lack CSRF protection, enabling attackers to manipulate data when a user is authenticated.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Attackers can change the super administrator's username and password, potentially gaining complete control of the application.
    - Attackers can change the prices of goods, leading to financial manipulation or disruption.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attacker needs to trick a logged-in super administrator into visiting a malicious page or opening a crafted email.
    - The attacker then leverages the absence of CSRF protection to perform unauthorized actions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious webpage or craft an email and lure a logged-in super administrator to visit the link. They do not need to know the administrator's credentials or have access to the application directly.
