  {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application allows directory traversal by using a full pathname preceded by the './' sequence.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Directory Traversal",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can access files and directories outside the web root folder, potentially including application source code, configuration files, and critical system files. Access to files is limited by system operational access control.",
    "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the 'pg' parameter in the 'ttawlogin.cgi' script with a path containing './' sequences or absolute paths.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No specific attacker position or capabilities are mentioned beyond that."
