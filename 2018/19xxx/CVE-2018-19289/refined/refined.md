  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to HTML injection due to lack of input sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "HTML injection",
    "Lack of input sanitization",
    "Cross-Origin bypass via PDF embed"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML content, including malicious JavaScript embedded in a PDF file, leading to URL redirection.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Injecting malicious HTML code into user input fields",
    "Embedding a malicious PDF file containing JavaScript via an HTML embed tag"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to inject HTML into the application, and host a malicious PDF file. The user must then load the vulnerable page in their browser."
