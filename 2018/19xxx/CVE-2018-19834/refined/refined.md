{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The ERC20 token `DDQ` has a function named `owned` which allows anyone to set the contract owner to their address.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unprotected ownership transfer function"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can take control of the smart contract, allowing them to perform sensitive operations, such as transferring tokens.",
    "attack_vectors": "By calling the `owned()` function, an attacker can set themselves as the contract's owner.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to invoke a function on the contract. No specific permissions are needed other than the ability to send a transaction to the vulnerable contract."
