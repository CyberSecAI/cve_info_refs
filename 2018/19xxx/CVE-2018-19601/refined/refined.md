The provided content describes a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Rhymix CMS 1.9.8.1.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided SVG files during upload. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into an SVG file, which when processed by the server, triggers the server to make requests to attacker-specified internal or external resources.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery):** The primary vulnerability is the ability of the attacker to force the server to make requests to arbitrary locations (local or remote) by crafting a malicious SVG file.
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The system allows the upload of SVG files without proper validation or sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Abuse of trust relationships:** An attacker can leverage the server's trust relationship with other systems.
*   **Bypass IP whitelisting:** SSRF can bypass restrictions based on IP addresses.
*   **Bypass host-based authentication:** Attackers can circumvent authentication mechanisms that rely on the server's identity.
*   **Access to internal resources:** Attackers can gain access to resources not intended for public access, such as internal APIs, trace.axd, or metadata APIs in cloud environments.
*   **Internal network scanning:** Attackers can scan the internal network the server is connected to.
*   **File system access:** The vulnerability might be exploited to read files from the web server's file system.
*   **Information disclosure:** Attackers might be able to retrieve sensitive information like the internal IP address of a web server behind a reverse proxy.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **File Upload:** The attacker uploads a specially crafted SVG file through the file upload functionality of Rhymix CMS.
*   **SVG Image Processing:** The server's handling of uploaded SVG files does not properly sanitize or validate the content, leading to the execution of malicious code embedded within the SVG.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Administrative Access:** The attacker needs administrative access to the Rhymix CMS to upload files.
*   **Ability to craft malicious SVG files:** The attacker must be able to create SVG files that contain code to trigger the desired requests.
