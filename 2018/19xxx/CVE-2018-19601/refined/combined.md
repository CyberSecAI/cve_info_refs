[![@security-breachlock](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41563984?u=512b721c12c210177062f96a927889c704477562&v=4&size=48)](/security-breachlock)[security-breachlock](https://github.com/security-breachlock)opened [on Sep 16, 2018](https://github.com/rhymix/rhymix/issues/1089#issue-360619275)

Affected software: Rhymix CMS 1.9.8.1

Type of vulnerability: SSRF via SVG file upload.

Description:

Discovered by: BreachLock

Website: <https://www.breachlock.com>

Author: Subodh Kumar

Description: SSRF as in Server Side Request Forgery is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to force server interfaces into sending packets initiated by the victim server to the local interface or to another server behind the firewall. Consult Web References for more information about this problem.

Impact on the server:

Abuse the trust relationship between the vulnerable server and others.

Bypass IP whitelisting.

Bypass host-based authentication services.

Read resources which are not accessible to the public, such as trace.axd in ASP.NET or metadata APIs in an AWS environment.

Scan the internal network to which the server is connected to.

Read files from the web server.

View Status Pages and interact with APIs as the web server.

Retrieve sensitive information such as the IP address of a web server behind a reverse proxy.

Remediation: Your script should properly sanitize user input.

<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Unrestricted_File_Upload>

Here is the crafted code for SSRF. Save this code as .svg file i.e. SSRF.svg

Steps to reproduce the vulnerability:

1. login site as admin.
2. Open URL <http://127.0.0.33/rhymix-master/index.php?module=admin&act=dispModuleAdminFileBox>
3. Upload SVG file with crafted SSRF code (See image upload.png).

4. Start netcat listener using the command "nc -nvlp 1234" (See image netcatlistner.png).

5. Open uploaded the file.
6. Check netcat listener (See image ncrequest.png).
