Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-19661:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `i2alaw_array()` and `i2ulaw_array()` functions within the `src/ulaw.c` and `src/alaw.c` files of the libsndfile library.
- Specifically, these functions are susceptible to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds Read:** The core issue is an out-of-bounds read, where the program attempts to access memory outside the allocated buffer.
- **Global Buffer Overflow:** The ASAN reports specify a global-buffer-overflow

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** As a direct consequence of the out-of-bounds read, an attacker can cause the application to crash, leading to a denial of service.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability could potentially lead to information disclosure, as the attacker may be able to read data from adjacent memory locations.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (Possible):** While not explicitly stated as confirmed, the Ubuntu Security Notice mentions "possibly execute arbitrary code".

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Audio File:** The primary attack vector involves a specially crafted audio file. The malformed file triggers the vulnerability within the `i2alaw_array()` or `i2ulaw_array()` functions during processing.
- **File Conversion:** The vulnerability can be triggered using the `sndfile-convert` utility when converting audio files to alaw or ulaw formats.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote as they only need to provide a malicious audio file.
- **Ability to provide malformed audio:** The attacker needs the ability to provide a malformed audio file to an application using the vulnerable library.
- **User interaction:** The user must open or process the crafted audio file using a vulnerable application that uses libsndfile.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability was found in libsndfile versions prior to the fix.
- The issue was triggered when converting audio files to alaw or ulaw formats using the `sndfile-convert` utility.
- The ASAN report shows the exact lines of code where the overflow occurs in `alaw.c` and `ulaw.c` files.
- The ASAN report also shows the location of the global variable that is being overflowed, `ulaw_encode`.
- The issue #429 on the libsndfile github is directly related to CVE-2018-19661 and includes the ASAN reports.

**Summary:**
CVE-2018-19661 is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability present in the `i2alaw_array()` and `i2ulaw_array()` functions of libsndfile. A remote attacker could exploit this by providing a crafted audio file, potentially causing a denial of service, information disclosure or arbitrary code execution.
