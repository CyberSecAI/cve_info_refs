Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability 1: "I Can't Believe It's not Stake"**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient validation of coinstake transactions before committing blocks/headers to memory or disk. This primarily stems from the adoption of Bitcoin's "headers-first" feature in PoS implementations without adapting the validation process to the specifics of Proof-of-Stake.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Failure to validate coinstake transactions at all when processing block headers.
    *   Failure to validate coinstake transactions before storing a block to disk.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **RAM exhaustion:** An attacker can fill a victim node's RAM by sending a flood of malicious block headers, causing the node to crash.
    *   **Disk exhaustion:** An attacker can fill a victim node's disk by sending malicious blocks. This is more serious as it may require manual intervention to clean up.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a large number of malicious block headers or blocks to a victim node.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** A network attacker, even without any stake in the affected cryptocurrency.

**Vulnerability 2: "Spent Stake Attack"**

*   **Root Cause:** Incomplete validation of coinstake transactions. The validation logic only checks if the output being spent exists in the main chain's transaction database, but not if it is unspent.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   The node only verifies the *existence* of a coin being spent in the main chain's TxDB, not that it is *unspent*.
    *   Validating coinstake transaction against the TxDB for the main chain even when the block is part of a fork.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Stake Amplification:** An attacker can create multiple self-spending transactions to artificially inflate their apparent stake.
     *  **Disk exhaustion**: An attacker can use amplified apparent stake to mine blocks on a past fork and fill the victim's disk with those invalid blocks.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Creating self-spending transactions to amplify apparent stake, then mining blocks using this apparent stake on a past fork, and finally sending these blocks to the victim.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs a small amount of stake, but can amplify it through self-spends.

**Additional points:**
*   The vulnerabilities are more prevalent in PoS cryptocurrencies that forked from Bitcoin Core version 0.10.0 or later, due to the inclusion of the "headers-first" feature.
*   The attacks exploit the fact that validating Proof-of-Stake is more complex than validating Proof-of-Work, leading to insufficient validation.
*   Mitigations such as checking for abnormal behavior or adding partial validation can help reduce the attack surface but are not perfect and may come at the cost of chain-splits.
* The provided text also mentions a coordinated vulnerability disclosure effort was undertaken to notify the affected cryptocurrency projects.
