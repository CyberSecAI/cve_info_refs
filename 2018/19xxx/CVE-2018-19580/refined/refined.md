- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of email notification and verification when a user changes their email address.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Absence of password verification during email address change.
    - Lack of notification to the old email address upon email change.

- **Attack vectors**: An attacker who has compromised an account can change the account's email address without the user's knowledge.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have already gained access to a user's account to exploit this vulnerability.
