  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered via HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable page by injecting malicious javascript code into the `GroupId` and `ConnPoolName` parameters.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to entice a user to click a specially crafted link or embed the link into a web page that a user visits, triggering the XSS payload. No prior authentication is needed."
