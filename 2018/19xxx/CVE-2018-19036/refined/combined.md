Security Advisory
IP Camera Vulnerability – 12. December 2018
CVE-2018-19036 (CVSS v3 Base Score: 9.4)

1  Overview and Management Summary

A recently discovered security vulnerability affects several Bosch IP cameras. It potentially allows the unauthorized
execution of code on the device via the network interface. Bosch rates this vulnerability at 9.4 (Critical) and recommends
customers to upgrade devices with updated firmware versions.

As of 2018-12-11, updated firmware files are published on the Bosch Download Store (Link).
As of 2018-12-12, there is currently no indication that the exploitation code is either publicly known or utilized.

If a firmware update is not possible in a timely manner, a reduction in the devices’ network exposure is advised. Internet-
accessible Bosch IP cameras should be firewalled, whilst additional steps like network isolation by VLAN, IP filtering
features of the devices and other technologies should be used to decrease the exposure of vulnerable devices.

The vulnerability was discovered and disclosed to Bosch in a coordinated manner by the external researcher, VDOO.

2  Technical Details

2.1  Vulnerability Classification and Solution Approach

This vulnerability is classified as ‘buffer overflow’, located in the RCP+ parser of the webserver. It is accordingly ranked as
“CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input”. The parser fix utilizes additional input and target-buffers checks.
The vulnerability resides in the firmware since version 6.32. Prior firmware versions are considered unaffected.

2.2  CVSS Rating

The CVSS V3 Base Score is rated at: 9.4 (Critical) CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H

2.3

Impact

The vulnerability can be used to remotely execute code on the device (RCE). This would enable a potential attacker, for
example, to bypass access restrictions (e.g. username / password) or to reactivate disabled features (e.g. telnet). A
necessary prerequisite for this attack is the network access to the webserver (HTTP / HTTPS) of the device. Despite its
critical rating, possible attacks are considered incapable of accessing private keys if they are stored on the devices’ Trusted
Platform Module (TPM). An affected camera can be restored to its original state by the factory reset button.

3  Vulnerability Fix

3.1  Firmware Updates (Device)

The recommended approach is to update the firmware of affected Bosch IP cameras to a fixed version. If an update is not
possible in a timely manner, the mitigation approaches Certificate Based Authentication, Firewalling, and IP Filtering can be
utilized. A list of affected devices and fixed firmware versions is available in appendix A of this document.

4  Mitigations and Workarounds

4.1  Certificate Based Authentication (Device)

Starting with Release 6.40.0240, the “unauthenticated” aspect of the vulnerability can be mitigated to “authenticated” by
enabling certificate-based authentication and executing additional hardening steps. After an initial certificate authentication

setup, additional hardening is mandatory for secure operation: Disable port 80, disable HSTS-redirect, and disable
password authentication. This enforces the webserver to demand a valid client-certificate during the initial TLS-Handshake.

4.2  Firewalling (Network)

It is also advised that the devices should not be exposed directly to the internet or other insecure networks. This includes
port-forwarding, which would not protect devices adequately. Firewalling a device significantly reduces its attack surface.

4.3

IP Filtering (Device)

As further supporting measure in shared environments, the devices’ internal IP filter can be activated. It allows the device
to whitelist IPs and IP-ranges. IPs not included in these ranges cannot connect, and therefore not exploit this vulnerability.
