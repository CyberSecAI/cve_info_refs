Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-19614:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization/encoding within the web interface's command console, specifically the `/cmdexec/cmdexe?cmd=` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The web interface of the affected routers is vulnerable to XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute malicious JavaScript code within the browser of a user accessing the vulnerable command console.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL targeting the router's command console.
- The malicious script is reflected back from the server and executed in the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL containing malicious JavaScript code and trick a user into visiting this URL while logged into the web interface of the affected router.
- The user needs to have an active session on the vulnerable device for the XSS to execute in their browser.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects all firmware versions of the Westermo DR-260, DR-250, and MR-260 routers.
- The affected products are considered End-of-Life (EOL), therefore, no patches are expected from the vendor.
