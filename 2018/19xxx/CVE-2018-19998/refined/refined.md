Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-19998:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `user/card.php` file of Dolibarr.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The `employee` parameter in `user/card.php` is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL command execution:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the `employee` parameter, potentially allowing them to read, modify, or delete data within the database.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** Successful exploitation could lead to the disclosure of sensitive data, modification of data, and potentially a denial of service if database integrity is compromised.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
- **HTTP POST request:** The attacker sends a malicious payload in the `employee` parameter via an HTTP POST request to the vulnerable `user/card.php` script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated user:** The attacker must be a valid, authenticated user within the Dolibarr system.
- **Low privileges:** The vulnerability is exploitable by an authenticated user with low privileges.
- **No user interaction:** The exploit does not require any further user interaction beyond the initial request from the attacker.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Dolibarr versions prior to 8.0.4.
- The fix involves sanitizing the `employee` parameter by casting it to an integer in `user/card.php` and in the `user.class.php`.
- The fix commit is 2b088a7.
