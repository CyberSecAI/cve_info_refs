ethereumjs-vm 2.4.0 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (vm.runCode failure and REVERT) via a "code: Buffer.from(my_code, 'hex')" attribute. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because REVERT is a normal bytecode that can be triggered from high-level source code, leading to a normal programmatic execution result.
