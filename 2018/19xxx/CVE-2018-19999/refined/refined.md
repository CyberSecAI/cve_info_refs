Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The Serv-U FTP Server has broken access controls allowing authentication bypass. The management application, which is a wrapper for the HTTP interface, can be accessed without proper authentication once the application is running and a valid session exists.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Authentication Bypass: The HTTP interface used by the Serv-U management application does not properly validate user credentials once a session is established.
- Broken Access Controls: Local users can access the HTTP interface without authentication when the management application is running.
- Predictable Session IDs: The session IDs are short numerical values, making brute-forcing feasible.
- Insecure Default Configuration: The service runs as SYSTEM by default, which grants extensive privileges and the default local admin account has no password.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege Escalation: A low-privilege local user can gain SYSTEM-level privileges.
- Remote Code Execution (RCE):  An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the Windows SYSTEM account. This is achieved by creating an event on any user account and triggering it.
- Full Control of Host OS: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain complete control over the host operating system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: The vulnerability requires the attacker to have local access to the machine running the Serv-U FTP Server.
- HTTP Request Manipulation: By sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the loopback interface with a valid session ID, an attacker can bypass authentication and access the management interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local User Access: The attacker must have an existing user account on the target system.
- Network Access to Loopback Interface: The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the loopback interface of the target system using HTTP.
- Session ID Brute-forcing: The attacker needs to brute-force the session ID.

**Additional Details:**
- The Serv-U management application uses a HTTP interface on the loopback interface (127.0.0.1).
- The Session ID parameter within the URL is a weak point, being a 4-5 digit numerical string, and thus easily brute-forceable.
- The vulnerability can be exploited even if an administrative user leaves the management application running in a disconnected RDP session.
- The vulnerability can be enumerated by sniffing traffic on a test machine under the attacker's control.

**Remediation:**
- Install the latest hotfix provided by Serv-U
- Set a strong password for the default local admin account.
- Run the service using a lower-privileged account.
