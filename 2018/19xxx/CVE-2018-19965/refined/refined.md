Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**CVE-2018-19965**

*   **Root Cause:** The `INVPCID` instruction, when used with a non-canonical address, raises a `#GP[0]` exception.  Older TLB flushing mechanisms, like `INVLPG`, would silently ignore such addresses, but the introduction of PCID made this a vulnerability. Xen's TLB flushing code was passing a non-canonical address, which had previously caused no issues, however now with PCID support it would result in a crash.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Use of `INVPCID` instruction with non-canonical addresses in Xen's TLB flushing code.
    *   Lack of input validation of addresses passed to the `INVPCID` instruction.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A buggy or malicious PV guest can crash the host system resulting in a denial of service (DoS).

*   **Attack Vectors:** A malicious or buggy 64-bit PV guest can trigger the vulnerability by providing a non-canonical address, accessible through a guest-accessible path in Xen.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code inside of a 64-bit PV guest.

**CVE-2018-19961 and CVE-2018-19962**

*   **Root Cause:** Xen was not correctly handling Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) flushes after IOMMU mapping changes on AMD x86 hardware, combined with an unsafe re-combination of small page mappings into larger ones.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
   *  Insufficient TLB flushing after IOMMU mapping changes.
   *  Unsafe recombination of small page mappings into large ones.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A malicious guest user could potentially escalate privileges, cause a host OS crash or leak information.

*   **Attack Vectors:** A malicious or buggy PV guest can exploit the vulnerability through IOMMU mapping changes and small page mappings.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code inside a PV guest.

**CVE-2018-19966**

*   **Root Cause:**  A faulty fix for CVE-2017-15595 (Meltdown) introduced a conflict related to how a union data structure is interpreted during shadow paging.

*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
   *   Incorrect fix for CVE-2017-15595 lead to a flawed interpretation of union data structures.
   *   Shadow paging was affected.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A malicious PV guest can cause a denial of service (host OS crash) or potentially escalate privileges or leak information.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A malicious PV guest could trigger the vulnerability through shadow paging mechanisms.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code inside a PV guest.

**CVE-2018-19967**

*   **Root Cause:** Xen does not work around Intel's mishandling of certain HLE transactions related to the `KACQUIRE` instruction prefix which could cause the host to hang.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Xen's failure to account for Intel's incorrect behavior for specific HLE transactions

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A guest OS user can cause a denial of service, leading to a host OS hang.

*   **Attack Vectors:** A guest OS user can trigger the vulnerability via specific HLE transactions associated with the `KACQUIRE` instruction prefix.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code inside the guest OS.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided documents often mention that the `-tools` and `-libs` packages do not contain the hypervisor fixes, as those fixes are applied directly in the Xen hypervisor.
*   Several SUSE advisories mention Xen versions being vulnerable due to the backport of the Meltdown fix.

**Summary**

The vulnerabilities primarily affect the Xen hypervisor. They are caused by flaws in memory management, TLB flushing, improper handling of specific CPU instructions, and incorrect fixes for previous vulnerabilities. The primary attack vector involves malicious or buggy PV guests, that could cause denial of service, privilege escalation or information leakage.
