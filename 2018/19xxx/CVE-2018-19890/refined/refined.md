  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The issue is an invalid memory address dereference in the `huffcode` function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Invalid memory access",
      "Dereferencing a pointer with an invalid memory address"
    ],
    "impact": "The program crashes due to a segmentation fault.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability is triggered by providing a crafted input file to the `faac` encoder. Specifically, the input file `faac_res/unkown_addr_huff2_115` causes a crash."
