  "Root cause": "The Python CGIs within the PWS component of Imperva SecureSphere v13 did not properly sanitize user-supplied command parameters.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Command Injection"
  ],
  "Impact": "Remote Command Execution, potentially leading to complete system compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP requests to vulnerable endpoints (/pws/impcli or /pws/inception)."
  ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability either unauthenticated (if the SecureSphere VM is not configured) or with valid agent registration credentials."
