The provided content describes multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities found in the PayFort PHP SDK. This content is related to CVE-2018-19186 as it is one of the CVEs listed in the advisory.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerabilities is the lack of proper sanitization and encoding of user-supplied input in the PayFort PHP SDK. Specifically, the code directly echoes user-provided data from the `$_REQUEST` array into the HTML output without any validation or escaping, leading to the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Reflected XSS:**  The `success.php`, `error.php`, and `route.php` files are vulnerable to reflected XSS because they directly output unsanitized input from the `$_REQUEST` array. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts by crafting specific URLs or POST requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit these XSS vulnerabilities to:
- Execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- Steal sensitive information, such as cookies and session tokens, potentially leading to account hijacking.
- Modify the content of the HTML page.
- Redirect users to malicious websites.
- Hijack the payment process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **GET Requests:** Attackers can craft malicious URLs with XSS payloads in the query parameters for files like `success.php` and `error.php`.
- **POST Requests:**  Attackers can submit POST requests to `route.php` with a malicious `paymentMethod` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send crafted HTTP requests (GET or POST) to the vulnerable web application that uses the PayFort SDK.
- The attacker needs to know the structure of the vulnerable URLs and POST parameters within the application that implements the SDK in order to inject the malicious script.

**Technical Details:**
- **Vulnerable Files:** `success.php`, `route.php`, and `error.php`
- **Vulnerable Code:**
    - `success.php`: Lines 16 and 36 where values from $_REQUEST are outputted without sanitization
    - `route.php`: Line 12, where the `paymentMethod` parameter is used in `processRequest()` without sanitization
    - `error.php`: Lines 19 and 40, where the `error_msg` parameter and all parameters in the $_REQUEST are outputted without sanitization
- **Payload Examples:** `<script>alert('533kurity')</script>` was used as a test payload to demonstrate the vulnerability.
- **Affected Version:** PHP SDK (commit 703c96f on Apr 26)
- The vulnerability is present in the publicly accessible SDK, even in files that were intended as 'simulator pages'.
