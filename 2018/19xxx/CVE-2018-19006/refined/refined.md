- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation, specifically when displaying AF elements and attributes containing JavaScript.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read and modify the contents of the PI Vision web page and data related to the PI Vision application in the victimâ€™s browser.
- **Attack vectors:** An authorized user with write access to the AF server can store malicious JavaScript in AF elements and attributes. When another user views a display referencing those elements, the malicious script executes in their browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authorized user of the AF server with write access to modify AF elements, element templates, or event frame templates. They also need to be able to convince another user to view a display that uses the malicious AF elements, triggering the XSS.
