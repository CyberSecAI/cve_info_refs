The provided content describes a vulnerability in FruityWifi, which is different from the specified CVE. However, it does detail a separate, unassigned security flaw.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The `www/modules/save.php` file lacks proper access control and is accessible to anyone.
- Input validation in the `regex_standard` function is insufficient and can be bypassed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Unauthenticated access:** The file `www/modules/save.php` is accessible without any authentication.
- **Command Injection:** The `mod_name` parameter in `modules/save.php` is vulnerable to command injection due to insufficient input validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the web server process (likely root in this case, according to the issue description "unauthorized remote code execution as root").
- **Complete system control:** The attacker could potentially gain complete control over the system.
- **Data exfiltration:** Demonstrated by the ability to execute `netcat -lp 1234 < /etc/passwd` which allows an attacker to leak sensitive data such as password hashes.

**Attack vectors:**

- **HTTP POST request:** Attackers send a crafted HTTP POST request to the `modules/save.php` endpoint with a malicious value in the `mod_name` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable FruityWifi server. No authentication is required.
