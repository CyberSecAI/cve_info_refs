## Description

[![@Pyriphlegethon](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13908830?v=4&size=48)](/Pyriphlegethon)[Pyriphlegethon](https://github.com/Pyriphlegethon)opened [on Nov 10, 2018](https://github.com/xtr4nge/FruityWifi/issues/250#issue-379464156)

FruityWifi contains two security vulnerabilities that allow an unauthorized attacker to take complete control over the system.

The first vulnerability has already been released by another researcher and was assigned `CVE-2018-17317`:

> FruityWifi (aka PatatasFritas/PatataWifi) 2.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in the io\_mode, ap\_mode, io\_action, io\_in\_iface, io\_in\_set, io\_in\_ip, io\_in\_mask, io\_in\_gw, io\_out\_iface, io\_out\_set, io\_out\_mask, io\_out\_gw, iface, or domain parameter to /www/script/config\_iface.php, or the newSSID, hostapd\_secure, hostapd\_wpa\_passphrase, or supplicant\_ssid parameter to /www/page\_config.php.

Now to exploit this vulnerability an attacker needs a valid session, but it turns out that command injection is also possible in a file that lacks any access control.

The file `www/modules/save.php` is accessible to anyone (erroneously?) and the validation attempt in `regex_standard` can be bypassed. So a POST request to `modules/save.php` with a `mod_name` value of `a; netcat -lp 1234 < /etc/passwd; echo`  will execute `netcat -lp 1234 < /etc/passwd`.

Even if the regex used in `regex_standard` were correct it would still be to lenient (because it allows `-` and spaces).
