- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The affected versions of the application have a path traversal vulnerability due to improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory. This allows an attacker to gain access to restricted information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path Traversal (CWE-22)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to access system data, which could result in escalation of privilege and unauthorized access to the controller.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited through adjacent network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be on the same network as the affected devices. The attacker requires low skill to exploit this vulnerability.
