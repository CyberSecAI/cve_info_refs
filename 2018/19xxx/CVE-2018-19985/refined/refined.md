In particular the Suse advisory and descriptions of the flaw in the Red Hat bugzilla entries clearly refer to the vulnerability.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause:**
    *   The vulnerability stems from a missing bounds check in the `hso_get_config_data` function (or within `hso_probe` directly, depending on the specific code path). This function (or `hso_probe` in some cases) reads the `if_num` value from a USB device, treats it as an unsigned 8-bit integer, and then uses this value to index into an array.
    *   If a malicious USB device provides an `if_num` value that exceeds the size of the target array, it results in an out-of-bounds (OOB) read.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Out-of-Bounds Read:**  The primary vulnerability is an OOB read, which occurs when accessing a memory location beyond the allocated bounds of an array.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:** The code does not validate the `if_num` value before using it as an array index.
    *   **Type Confusion/Inconsistent Handling:** Some analysis suggests the `if_num` variable (a `u8`) is used directly as index to an array, which could cause type issues/confusion leading to an OOB read

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Leakage:** The OOB read allows an attacker to potentially read kernel memory.  This could expose sensitive information which could lead to further exploitation.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  By triggering the OOB read, the attacker can cause a system crash. This occurs because reading out of bounds can lead to memory access errors.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Physical Access:** The attack requires physical access to the system, as the attacker must be able to connect a malicious USB device to the vulnerable machine.
    *   **Malicious USB Device:** The attacker must use a specially crafted USB device that provides a specific, out-of-bounds value for `if_num`

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Local Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the target system.
    *   **USB Device Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to craft or modify a USB device to send a specific, out-of-bounds `if_num` value in the USB descriptors.
   

**3. Additional Notes:**

*   **Specific Driver:** The vulnerability is located within the `drivers/net/usb/hso.c` driver (or related functions when present in other projects) which is a Huawei mobile broadband (HSO) USB driver in the Linux Kernel, and related to the processing of configuration data during USB device initialization. This makes a specific type of USB device required for exploitation.
*   **Upstream Patch:** The upstream patch adds bounds checks to the code. Specifically, it checks if `if_num` is greater than 16 before indexing in `hso_get_config_data` and, in `hso_probe`, it ensures that the access to the array based on if\_num is within the bounds of the `driver_info`.
*   **Real-Time Kernel Impact:** Some sources (Red Hat) mention that this vulnerability could also impact their real-time kernel builds.
*   **Severity:** The vulnerability is generally considered moderate to important in terms of security impact because it can lead to information disclosure and system crash. Suse considers the attack vector to be "physical", although "local" would also be a correct assessment.

*   **Mitigation:**  Some systems may have limited protection if the user is not privileged enough to create user namespaces. However, nested VMX is disabled by default, thus fully mitigating the issue on those systems.

**4. Summary of CVE-2018-19985:**

CVE-2018-19985 is a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's HSO USB driver where a missing bounds check when accessing a USB device's configuration data can allow a local attacker with a specially crafted USB device to trigger an out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to information disclosure and system crash.
