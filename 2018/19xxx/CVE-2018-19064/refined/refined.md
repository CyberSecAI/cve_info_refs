Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-19064:

**CVE-2018-19064 Analysis**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the use of hardcoded credentials for the built-in FTP user (`ftpuser1`) which has an empty password. Additionally, the password for `ftpuser1` cannot be changed by normal means even after successful login.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **CWE-255:** Insecure Default Credentials - The FTP user `ftpuser1` has an empty password by default.
    *   **CWE-798:** Use of Hard-coded Credentials - The `ftpuser1` password cannot be changed.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the device's FTP service, potentially allowing them to upload or download files. This can lead to further compromise of the device.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Network-based attack; an attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs network access to the device to exploit the vulnerability. They do not require prior authentication or specific privileges.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions multiple other vulnerabilities affecting the same Foscam devices, including remote command execution, denial of service, credential disclosure, and more, but they are covered by other CVEs and thus not the focus of this analysis.
*   The document gives more detail about the implications of this vulnerability as an entry point for more complex attacks.
*   The advisory also notes that while the vulnerability is present in multiple devices, not all vulnerabilities are present in all models.
