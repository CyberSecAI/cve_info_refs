Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

* **Root Cause:** The Hetronic Nova-M remote control system uses fixed codes for communication between the transmitter and receiver. These codes are not encrypted or dynamically generated, making them susceptible to capture and replay.

* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Authentication Bypass by Capture-Replay (CWE-294):** The core vulnerability lies in the system's lack of proper authentication mechanisms. The fixed codes allow an attacker to record a valid command and replay it later to achieve the desired effect.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Unauthorized Command Replay:** An attacker can replay captured commands to control the device.
    *   **Spoofing Arbitrary Messages:** An attacker could send crafted messages to the receiver, potentially causing unintended behavior.
    *   **Denial of Service:** An attacker can force the controlled load into a permanent stop state, preventing normal operation.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Adjacent Network:** The attack is carried out by sniffing the wireless communication between the transmitter and receiver. This implies an attacker needs to be within the radio range of the devices.

* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be in close proximity to the devices to intercept the radio signals.
    *   **Sniffing Capabilities:** The attacker requires the ability to capture and retransmit radio signals, which could be achieved with readily available hardware.
    *   **Low Skill Level:** The advisory explicitly states that the attack requires a low skill level. This suggests the attack can be carried out with simple tools and techniques.

The advisory also mentions the affected products, the CVSS score, and the recommended mitigations, which are primarily firmware updates.
