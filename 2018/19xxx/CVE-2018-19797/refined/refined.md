{
  "CVE-2018-19797": {
    "Description": "In LibSass 3.5.5, a NULL Pointer Dereference in the function Sass::Selector_List::populate_extends in SharedPtr.hpp (used by ast.cpp and ast_selectors.cpp) may cause a Denial of Service (application crash) via a crafted sass input file.",
    "Root cause": "A NULL pointer dereference occurs in the `populate_extends` function due to a missing null check on `pIter` before accessing its members.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "NULL pointer dereference"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (application crash).",
     "Attack vector": "Network",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a crafted SASS file that triggers the vulnerable code path.",
    "Additional details": "The vulnerability is located in the `Selector_List::populate_extends` function within `ast_selectors.cpp`. The issue arises when processing extend directives in nested selectors, where the `pIter` variable can become NULL. Without proper null checks before accessing `pIter->head()` or `pIter->tail()`, a crash is triggered. The fix involves adding a null check on `pIter`."
