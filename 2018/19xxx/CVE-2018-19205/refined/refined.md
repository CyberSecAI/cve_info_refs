The provided content relates to CVE-2018-19205, specifically regarding the Roundcube Webmail 1.3.7 release which includes a security fix for the EFAIL vulnerability.

Based on the changelog, one of the fixes addresses the "Enigma: [EFAIL] Don't decrypt PGP messages with no MDC protection".

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is related to the EFAIL vulnerability in OpenPGP, specifically affecting encrypted PGP messages without Modification Detection Code (MDC) protection.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of PGP messages, where the absence of MDC allows potential attacks that can expose the plaintext of encrypted messages.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to the disclosure of the content of encrypted emails.
*  **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves exploiting the EFAIL vulnerability by crafting specific PGP messages, lacking MDC, which could then be used to reveal the decrypted plaintext.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to send/intercept and manipulate PGP-encrypted messages targeting the vulnerable Roundcube installation.

The provided content indicates that the Roundcube 1.3.7 release mitigates this EFAIL issue by not decrypting PGP messages lacking MDC protection, indicating a security fix was implemented.
