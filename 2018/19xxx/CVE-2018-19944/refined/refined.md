- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the cleartext transmission of sensitive information when using SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the lack of encryption during the transmission of sensitive information via SNMP. This allows unauthorized access to sensitive data if the network communication is intercepted.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information being transmitted in cleartext.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can intercept network traffic and obtain sensitive information transmitted via SNMP.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be in a position to intercept network traffic to exploit this vulnerability.
