The provided content describes a directory traversal vulnerability in the Zyxel VMG1312-B10D web server.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The web server improperly handles user-supplied input when requesting files, allowing directory traversal via the `../` sequence in the URL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Directory traversal, arbitrary file access.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can access sensitive files on the router's file system, such as `/etc/passwd` which contains user account information including hashed passwords.

**Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET request containing directory traversal sequences in the URL to the vulnerable web server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the router's web server, which is typically on the LAN side. The attacker does not require any authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
