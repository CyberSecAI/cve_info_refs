Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the `showdoc.cc` application. The application does not properly validate the origin of requests, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF:** The application lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks. Specifically, the `/api/teamMember/save` endpoint doesn't verify the origin of the request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Actions:** An attacker can force a logged-in user to perform actions they did not intend. In this specific case, the attacker can add a new member to a team without the user's explicit consent.
- **Data Manipulation:** In this case, user data within the application is modified.
- **Privilege Escalation:**  Adding a new user to a team can lead to privilege escalation, where the attacker gains unauthorized access or control over resources within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Web Page:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page that contains a form submitting a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker uses social engineering to trick the victim into opening the malicious web page while they are logged into the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of the Target Application:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint (`/api/teamMember/save`) and the required parameters (`team_id`, `member_username`).
- **Ability to Host a Malicious Page:** The attacker must be able to host the malicious HTML page, possibly on a web server, or through phishing.
- **Victim Must Be Logged In:** The victim must have an active session with the vulnerable `showdoc.cc` application.
