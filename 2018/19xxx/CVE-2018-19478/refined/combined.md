Package        : ghostscript
Version        : 9.06~dfsg-2+deb8u13
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-19134 CVE-2018-19478

Some vulnerabilities were discovered in ghostscript, an interpreter for the
PostScript language and for PDF.

CVE-2018-19134

    The setpattern operator did not properly validate certain types. A specially
    crafted PostScript document could exploit this to crash Ghostscript or,
    possibly, execute arbitrary code in the context of the Ghostscript process.
    This is a type confusion issue because of failure to check whether the
    Implementation of a pattern dictionary was a structure type.

CVE-2018-19478

    Attempting to open a carefully crafted PDF file results in long-running
    computation. A sufficiently bad page tree can lead to us taking significant
    amounts of time when checking the tree for recursion.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
9.06~dfsg-2+deb8u13.

We recommend that you upgrade your ghostscript packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=699856#c0)  Shawn Rasheed    2018-10-03 07:29:08 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 15743](attachment.cgi?id=15743 "The crafted PDF file") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=15743&action=edit "The crafted PDF file") The crafted PDF file  Attempting to open a carefully crafted PDF results in a long-running computation. The page tree nodes are deeply nested where a child page tree node may be a descendent of multiple parents.  It was tested on 9.25 and commit: [cbdc54055b7db024951daf3dcb3cafe0af458e47](http://www.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/findgit.cgi?cbdc54055b7db024951daf3dcb3cafe0af458e47) from the repo, <http://git.ghostscript.com/ghostpdl.git> ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=699856#c1)  Ken Sharp    2018-10-03 12:58:13 UTC  ``` I'm afraid I don't see a way to address this in the current PDF interpreter. The reason this takes such a long time to run is because before we start processing the page contents we first check the page tree for consistency, to ensure it does not have any recursive elements.  We have to do this, because we've found files in the past that do contain recursion in the page tree, which also leads to a (genuinely endless) loop.  Now in this case what we have is, essentially, a gigantic tree. Its not presented as such, because at each level it reuses existing entries. Nevertheless, when fully resolved, this tree has 2^25 leaf nodes.  The PDF interpreter has to check the path from the root of the tree to every node in order to make sure there is no recursion in the tree. This does indeed take time, lots of time. Given sufficient time I believe this will eventually complete.  But its trivial to produce a PostScript file which has the same effect. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=699856#c2)  Ken Sharp    2018-10-03 14:23:36 UTC  ``` Actually, I've had a thought.... ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=699856#c3)  Ken Sharp    2018-10-03 16:02:40 UTC  ``` OK bright idea seems to actually work. Fixed in commit [0a7e5a1c309fa0911b892fa40996a7d55d90bace](http://www.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/findgit.cgi?0a7e5a1c309fa0911b892fa40996a7d55d90bace) ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=699856#c4)  Shawn Rasheed    2018-10-03 17:52:26 UTC  ``` Hi Ken,  I have not had a look at the fix yet. But my understanding is the call tree grows exponentially because the check revists the same nodes over and over again. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=699856#c5)  Ken Sharp    2018-10-04 07:05:25 UTC  ``` (In reply to Shawn Rasheed from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=699856#c4)) > Hi Ken, >  > I have not had a look at the fix yet. But my understanding is the call tree > grows exponentially because the check revists the same nodes over and over > again.  Umm yes, and then again, no...  The exponentiallity is due to the fact that the pages tree grows exponentially with each layer you add. Your file is constructed somewhat like this (numbers are the object numbers in the PDF file):                                    2                               /      \                              6        7                             / \      / \                            8   9    8   9                           /     \  /     \                          10    11 10     11 ...                         3        3 3      3  So the check revisits the same nodes because it is descending the tree to the leaf node for every path in the tree. Adding another level to the tree in this construction simply means adding another intermediate node, but it doubles the number of leaf nodes, hence the exponential increase.  To avoid that we would have to note that the intermediate nodes have been previously encountered (but not in a circular reference), and have been fully resolved. Not an easy task in PostScript, especially to retrofit to an existing PostScript program. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=699856#c6)  Shawn Rasheed    2018-11-27 01:25:31 UTC  ``` CVE identifier for this bug: CVE-2018-19478 ``` |  |
