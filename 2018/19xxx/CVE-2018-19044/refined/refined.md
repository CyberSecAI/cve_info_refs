{
  "CVE-2018-19044": {
    "root_cause": "Improper pathname validation when writing to temporary files using `PrintData` or `PrintStats` DBus methods.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The application does not check for symbolic links when writing to files, resulting in a symlink vulnerability.",
      "Insecure file permissions (mode 666) could be created during the vulnerability."
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the system, leading to potential privilege escalation or denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access is required to create a symbolic link pointing to the target file.",
      "Invoking the `PrintData` or `PrintStats` DBus methods."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to create a symlink in a location where the keepalived daemon will write a file (e.g. `/tmp`). The attacker does not necessarily require any privileges over those required to connect to the DBus interface."
  }
