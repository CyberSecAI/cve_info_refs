  "CVE-2018-19535": {
    "description": "A heap-based buffer over-read in the PngChunk::readRawProfile function in pngchunk_int.cpp may cause a denial of service via a crafted PNG file.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a heap-based buffer over-read in the `PngChunk::readRawProfile` function within `pngchunk_int.cpp`. The code reads data from a buffer, interpreting it as a hexadecimal string, without properly checking the buffer size. A crafted PNG file with specific metadata triggers the over-read.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Heap-based buffer over-read",
        "Insufficient input validation"
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of service (application crash) due to the heap-based buffer over-read.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Crafted PNG file",
         "Specifically crafted PNG metadata"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious PNG file."
