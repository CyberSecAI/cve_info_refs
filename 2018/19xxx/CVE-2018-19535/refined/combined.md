# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

This should fix the problem described in [#428](https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/issues/428). It also adds a new regression test to reproduce the issue.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Thanks for doing this, [@piponazo](https://github.com/piponazo)  I'll review your changes this evening. My head is full of the MinGW/setMsg() puzzle at the moment ([#421](https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/issues/421)) And I'm working in the garden as well. Beautiful sunny day. |

| Apologies for not getting to this on Monday, Luis. I was exhausted (and delighted) by solving the MinGW/setMsg/GCC8.2.0 issue ([#421](https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/issues/421)). I've reproduced [#428](https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/issues/428) and will work on it later today (Tuesday). First priority is to review this PR.  Thanks for working on this.  My old friend Gaylord lives in California and yesterday was his 80th birthday. I've known him for 40 years and went to visit him 2 weeks ago. We didn't go to California for his birthday party yesterday, however we had a little cake and candles on the patio. Life is good when retired! <https://clanmills.com/2018/September/>  [dsc_8694](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/529982/45031261-482e6700-b046-11e8-816d-4790e8e721dc.jpg) |

The code is cavalier in galloping forward without checking that it is reading within the buffer. `atol()` can also gallop, so I've added `const char* startOfLength;` and delayed `atol()` until I feel safe.  Having decoded the length, the code gallops decoding hex/nibbles without bothering to test if the buffer has 2\*length bytes. I've added `const char* endOfLength` to know the first byte following the length string. When we calculate `nibbles = 2*length`, I test it for sanity.  Like you, I think the code needs a major review and the schedule doesn't permit this at the moment.  I've put my modified version of PngChunk::readRawProfile() which includes the fixes that I've mentioned. This seems to fix the 6 POCs provided in [#428](https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/issues/428)  ``` 1197 rmills@rmillsmm:~/gnu/github/exiv2/exiv2/build $ for i in $(ls ~/Downloads/*.png|sort); do echo ---- $i ---- ;

| Apologies. I built and tested the wrong code on my machine yesterday. I've reproduced the test errors being reported. Somehow this has broken icc-test.sh. I'll debug and fix it tomorrow.  Curiously, test the ASAN build has revealed something in stringto-test.sh and preview-test.sh and I'll also investigate that tomorrow and if necessary open new issues to address those matters. |

| I'm making steady progress with this. More difficult than expected.  I've identified what's causing stringto-test to fail (when built for ASAN) and I'll open a different issue (with patch).  I want to continue painting the summer house today and hope to finish this issue this evening. |

| More challenges:   1. There's another ASAN address issue in `src/iptc.cpp int IptcParser::decode()`    I don't believe I have time to work on that until Sunday afternoon. 2. There's also something incorrect about CMake/setting the ASAN switches with:  ``` $ cmake .. -G Xcode -DEXIV2_TEAM_USE_SANITIZERS=On  ```  If I build without `-DEXIV2_TEAM_USE_SANITIZERS=On`, I can enable them from the Xcode gui.  I've found this article (although I don't know if this is true) <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44320465/whats-the-proper-way-to-enable-addresssanitizer-in-cmake-that-works-in-xcode> I suspect we'll need something similar to the following which was added to `src/CMakeLists.txt:`  ``` 1624 rmills@rmillsmm:~/gnu/github/exiv2/exiv2 $ nl -b a src/CMakeLists.txt | grep -i xcode     315	        XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_GCC_GENERATE_DEBUGGING_SYMBOLS[variant=Debug] "YES" 1625 rmills@rmillsmm:~/gnu/github/exiv2/exiv2 $   ``` |

| [@clanmills](https://github.com/clanmills) we added the `XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_GCC_GENERATE_DEBUGGING_SYMBOLS` configuration into `src/CMakeLists.txt`few months ago.  If the investigation you are doing is going to take long, I propose to merge the branch in the current status so that we have at least few fixes for 0.27 RC1. We can investigate the other issues later. |

| Oh, I know you added `XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_GCC_GENERATE_DEBUGGING_SYMBOLS`. My suspicion is that we need something similar to enable ASAN to build/debug correctly from the Xcode IDE.  I'll fix the ASAN issues in `IptcParser::decode()` and `PngChunk::readRawProfile()` and get [#428](https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/issues/428) closed.  I'll open a new issue about `stringto-test.cpp`. |

I've reviewed PngChunk::readRawProfile() again. My previous comments stand. The code is galloping along a buffer without checking for the end.

I don't know the Specification for this code. From the comments, this has been specified by ImageMagick. It seems that an Exif (&Iptc) binary metadata block is encoded as hex nibbles which are decoded. If the decoding fails, the chunk is returned as raw binary. These raw chunks can contain an ICC profile or XMP/xml.

```
        DataBuf PngChunk::readRawProfile(const DataBuf& text,bool iTXt)
        {
            DataBuf                 info;
            unsigned char           unhex[103]={0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0, 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,

    Exiv2::Internal::PngChunk::keyTXTChunk function of pngchunk_int.cpp. A
    crafted PNG file will lead to a remote denial of service attack.

CVE-2017-18005

    Exiv2 has a Null Pointer Dereference in the Exiv2::DataValue::toLong
    function in value.cpp, related to crafted metadata in a TIFF file.

CVE-2018-8976

    jpgimage.cpp allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
    (image.cpp Exiv2::Internal::stringFormat out-of-bounds read) via a crafted
    file.

CVE-2018-17581

    CiffDirectory::readDirectory() at crwimage_int.cpp has excessive stack
    consumption due to a recursive function, leading to Denial of service.

CVE-2018-19107

    Exiv2::IptcParser::decode in iptc.cpp (called from psdimage.cpp in the PSD
    image reader) may suffer from a denial of service (heap-based buffer
    over-read) caused by an integer overflow via a crafted PSD image file.

CVE-2018-19108

    Exiv2::PsdImage::readMetadata in psdimage.cpp in the PSD image reader may
    suffer from a denial of service (infinite loop) caused by an integer
    overflow via a crafted PSD image file.

CVE-2018-19535

    PngChunk::readRawProfile in pngchunk_int.cpp may cause a denial of service
    (application crash due to a heap-based buffer over-read) via a crafted PNG
    file.

CVE-2018-20097

    There is a SEGV in Exiv2::Internal::TiffParserWorker::findPrimaryGroups of
    tiffimage_int.cpp. A crafted input will lead to a remote denial of service
    attack.

CVE-2019-13110

    A CiffDirectory::readDirectory integer overflow and out-of-bounds read
    allows an attacker to cause a denial of service (SIGSEGV) via a crafted CRW
    image file.

CVE-2019-13112

    A PngChunk::parseChunkContent uncontrolled memory allocation allows an
    attacker to cause a denial of service (crash due to an std::bad_alloc
    exception) via a crafted PNG image file.

CVE-2019-13114

    http.c allows a malicious http server to cause a denial of service (crash
    due to a NULL pointer dereference) by returning a crafted response that
    lacks a space character.

CVE-2019-13504

    There is an out-of-bounds read in Exiv2::MrwImage::readMetadata in
    mrwimage.cpp.

CVE-2019-14369

    Exiv2::PngImage::readMetadata() in pngimage.cpp allows attackers to cause a
    denial of service (heap-based buffer over- read) via a crafted image file.

CVE-2019-14370

    There is an out-of-bounds read in Exiv2::MrwImage::readMetadata() in
    mrwimage.cpp. It could result in denial of service.

CVE-2019-17402

    Exiv2 allows attackers to trigger a crash in Exiv2::getULong in types.cpp
    when called from Exiv2::Internal::CiffDirectory::readDirectory in
    crwimage_int.cpp, because there is no validation of the relationship of the
    total size to the offset and size.

CVE-2020-18771

    Exiv2 has a global buffer over-read in
    Exiv2::Internal::Nikon1MakerNote::print0x0088 in nikonmn_int.cpp which can
    result in an information leak.

CVE-2021-29458

    An out-of-bounds read was found in Exiv2. The out-of- bounds read is
    triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image file.
    An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial
    of service by crashing Exiv2, if they can trick the victim into running
    Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when
    writing the metadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than
    reading the metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2
    command-line application, you need to add an extra command-line argument
    such as insert.

CVE-2021-32815

    The assertion
    failure is triggered when Exiv2 is used to modify the metadata of a
    crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the
    vulnerability to cause a denial of service, if they can trick the
    victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug
    is only triggered when modifying the metadata, which is a less
    frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata. For
    example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you
    need to add an extra command-line argument such as `fi`.

CVE-2021-34334

    An infinite loop is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a
    crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability
    to cause a denial of service, if they can trick the victim into running
    Exiv2 on a crafted image file.

CVE-2021-37620

    An out-of-bounds read is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata
    of a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the
    vulnerability to cause a denial of service, if they can trick the victim
    into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file.

CVE-2021-37621

    An infinite loop is triggered when Exiv2 is used to print the metadata of a
    crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability
    to cause a denial of service, if they can trick the victim into running
    Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when
    printing the image ICC profile, which is a less frequently used Exiv2
    operation that requires an extra command line option (`-p C`).

CVE-2021-37622

    An infinite loop is triggered when Exiv2 is used to modify the metadata of
    a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the
    vulnerability to cause a denial of service, if they can trick the victim
    into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only
    triggered when deleting the IPTC data, which is a less frequently used
    Exiv2 operation that requires an extra command line option (`-d I rm`).

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
0.25-4+deb10u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your exiv2 packages.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1652637#c0)  Jan Grulich    2018-11-22 13:46:46 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1651917](show_bug.cgi?id=1651917 "CLOSED ERRATA - Rebase exiv2 to 0.27.2") +++  Exiv2 0.27 should be released in 28th of December.   Goals of this release are: * Security fixes * Bug Fixes * Improved CMake Support * Conan Support * Adobe XMPsdk 2016 support * New python based test suite * AppVeyor, Travis, CodeCov and GitLibs monitor submissions * Support for MinGW/msys2 J* enkins buildserver operates from GitHub * All new documentation and web site.  I mostly care about security fixes, I backported many of them to Exiv2 0.26 and some of them are still not fixed. All should be gone with the new release.  We will most probably need to rebuild some other packages because of this, like libgexiv2.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1652637#c7)  Jan Grulich    2019-01-28 16:08:24 UTC  ``` Fixed with exiv2-0.27.0-1.el7_6.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1652637#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-08-06 12:47:26 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.  For information on the advisory, and where to find the updated files, follow the link below.  If the solution does not work for you, open a new bug report.
