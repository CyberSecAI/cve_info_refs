{
  "CVE-2018-19640": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists due to the supportutils script creating a temporary archive that includes files from /tmp. An attacker with the ability to write files to /tmp can create files that will cause arbitrary processes to be killed by the supportutils script.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption",
      "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with write access to `/tmp` can kill arbitrary processes on the local machine.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker needs to create a file with a name that matches the pattern '*SEMAPHORE.pid' inside the directory where the supportutils script collects log files, typically /tmp, before the supportutils script runs. The file should contain the process ID of the process that the attacker wants to kill.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to write to the /tmp directory and have knowledge of the process ID to be killed. A low privileged user on the system can achieve this."
