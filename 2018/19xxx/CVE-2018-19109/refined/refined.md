The provided content describes an incorrect access control vulnerability in the `tianti` project.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of permission checks in the backend controllers (`cmscontroller.java` and `usercontroller.java`) before executing actions. Specifically, the `/column/list` endpoint in `cmscontroller` and the `/skin/list` endpoint in `usercontroller` do not verify if the user has the necessary privileges to access those functionalities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The application fails to enforce proper authorization, allowing users with limited permissions to access and modify resources beyond their intended scope.
- **Missing Permission Checks:**  The backend controller methods directly process requests without validating user roles or permissions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access to Functionality:** Users with permission role can access functionalities intended only for super administrators (e.g., column management, skin management).
- **Unauthorized Modification of Data:**  The permission role can edit column data and skin settings without proper authorization.

**Attack vectors:**
- Direct URL manipulation: An attacker can directly access restricted URLs (e.g., `/tianti-module-admin/cms/column/list`, `/tianti-module-admin/user/skin/list`) without proper authorization.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs a valid user account with the "permission role" in the `tianti` application. They must also be aware of the vulnerable endpoints.
