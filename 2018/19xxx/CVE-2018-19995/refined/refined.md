The provided content relates to CVE-2018-19995.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `user/card.php` file within Dolibarr. Specifically, the "address" and "town" parameters were not being adequately sanitized before being used, leading to the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Improper input sanitization on the "address" and "town" parameters within `user/card.php`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML. This could lead to various malicious actions, including:
  - Stealing session cookies.
  - Defacing the application.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack via HTTP requests.
- Attacker provides malicious script in the "address" or "town" parameters when updating a user profile.
- Vulnerable page `user/card.php` renders the malicious payload within the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a remote, authenticated user with access to modify user profiles.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint `user/card.php`.

**Additional details:**
The provided content includes the commit diffs that were made to address this vulnerability. These diffs clearly show the changes made to sanitize the "address," "zipcode," and "town" parameters using the `alphanohtml` filter.
The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" with a CVSS score of 5.4 and an EPSS score of 0.056%.
The vulnerability is present in Dolibarr versions prior to 8.0.4.
The fix involves applying proper sanitization to user-provided data.
