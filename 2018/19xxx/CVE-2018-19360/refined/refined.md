Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-19360:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper polymorphic deserialization of untrusted data within the `jackson-databind` library. Specifically, the library fails to block the `axis2-transport-jms` class during deserialization, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. This is a bypass of intended deserialization protection by failing to block a specific known vulnerable class.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Polymorphic Deserialization:** The core issue is that the `jackson-databind` library, when deserializing data, doesn't properly restrict which classes can be instantiated. This allows an attacker to inject a malicious class (in this case, `axis2-transport-jms`) during deserialization.
*   **Incomplete Blacklist:** The vulnerability arises due to an incomplete blacklist of classes that should not be deserialized, which allows the attacker to bypass security measures by injecting `axis2-transport-jms`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The most severe impact is the potential for arbitrary code execution on the affected system. An attacker could inject malicious code that is then executed by the application during deserialization. This allows for complete compromise of the system, leading to data breaches, system hijacking, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** The primary attack vector is the deserialization of untrusted data. An attacker can craft a malicious JSON payload that includes the name of a disallowed class, and this crafted payload, when processed using jackson-databind, could lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Polymorphism:** The vulnerability takes advantage of polymorphic deserialization to instantiate a malicious object by using the name of a vulnerable class.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to send JSON data:** The attacker needs to be able to send malicious JSON data to an application using the vulnerable `jackson-databind` library. The application must be configured in a way that it attempts to deserialize objects based on type hints contained within the received JSON data.
*   **No Authentication Required:** In many cases, no authentication is required for this attack to succeed, making it easier to exploit, although specific products and configurations may differ.
*  **Understanding of Vulnerable Components:** The attacker must understand that vulnerable components using a vulnerable version of jackson-databind which can then be exploited when deserializing the malicious payload.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability is referenced in multiple Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSAs), indicating its widespread impact on Red Hat products that use `jackson-databind`.
*   The issue was fixed by adding the vulnerable classes to the blacklist of classes not allowed to be instantiated when deserializing data.
* The advisory also mentions other related CVEs that were fixed by the same patch, indicating a common underlying issue related to polymorphic deserialization in Jackson.
