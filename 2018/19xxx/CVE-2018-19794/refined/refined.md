**1. Verification:**

- The content from `lists.internet2.edu` and `bugs.internet2.edu` explicitly mentions "Reflected XSS in New UI with /UiV2Public.index" and references "GRP-1838" which is the Jira issue related to this vulnerability.
- The provided URL example `/grouperExternal/public/UiV2Public.index?operation=UiV2Public.postIndex&function=UiV2Public.error&code=%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E` matches the description for the vulnerability.

Therefore, this content is **RELEVANT** to CVE-2018-19794.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

   - **Root Cause:** The Grouper UI (versions 2.2 and 2.3) is vulnerable to a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw in the `/UiV2Public.index` endpoint.
   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
     - The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `code` parameter of the `/UiV2Public.index` URL.
     - Specifically, it reflects the value of the `code` parameter in the HTML response without proper encoding, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.
   - **Impact of Exploitation:**
     - An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the user's browser by crafting a malicious URL.
     - This can lead to various security risks such as:
       - Session hijacking.
       - Phishing attacks.
       - Defacement of the user interface.
       - Execution of unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim.
   - **Attack Vectors:**
     - The primary attack vector is a specially crafted URL that contains a malicious JavaScript payload in the `code` parameter.
     - The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking the malicious URL (e.g. through social engineering, phishing emails).
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
     - The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL that includes the malicious JavaScript payload.
     - The attacker also needs to be able to lure a victim into accessing this crafted URL via their browser.
     - No specific privileged access to the target application is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**3. Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in Grouper UI versions 2.2 and 2.3.
- Patches have been released to address this vulnerability for versions 2.2.2 and 2.3.0.
- The patches are described as "low risk" and "lightweight."
-  A demonstration of how to reproduce this vulnerability is provided. If the vulnerability exists, a javascript alert box (alert(1)) will display when accessing the malicious URL. If the patch is applied and the vulnerability is fixed, the javascript alert will not be displayed.

The provided information offers a detailed view of the vulnerability and the steps taken to remediate it, providing more detail than the generic CVE description would likely offer.
