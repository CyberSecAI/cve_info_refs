## Details

Wen Xu discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the ext4

filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10876](/security/CVE-2018-10876), [CVE-2018-10879](/security/CVE-2018-10879))

Wen Xu discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the ext4 filesystem

implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this to construct

a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-10877](/security/CVE-2018-10877))

Wen Xu discovered that an out-of-bounds write vulnerability existed in the

ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use

this to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10878](/security/CVE-2018-10878), [CVE-2018-10882](/security/CVE-2018-10882))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly ensure that xattr information remained in inode

bodies. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image

that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-10880](/security/CVE-2018-10880))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel could possibly perform an out of bounds write when updating the

journal for an inline file. An attacker could use this to construct a

malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2018-10883](/security/CVE-2018-10883))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the vsock address family

implementation of the Linux kernel that could lead to a use-after-free

condition. A local attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to

expose sensitive information (host machine kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-14625](/security/CVE-2018-14625))

Cfir Cohen discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the

KVM implementation of the Linux kernel, when handling interrupts in

environments where nested virtualization is in use (nested KVM

virtualization is not enabled by default in Ubuntu kernels). A local

attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to gain administrative

privileges in a host machine. ([CVE-2018-16882](/security/CVE-2018-16882))

Jann Horn discovered that the procfs file system implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly restrict the ability to inspect the kernel

stack of an arbitrary task. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-17972](/security/CVE-2018-17972))

Jann Horn discovered that the mremap() system call in the Linux kernel did

not properly flush the TLB when completing, potentially leaving access to a

physical page after it has been released to the page allocator. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash), expose

sensitive information, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-18281](/security/CVE-2018-18281))

Wei Wu discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not

properly ensure that ioapics were initialized. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-19407](/security/CVE-2018-19407))

It was discovered that the debug interface for the Linux kernel's HID

subsystem did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. An

attacker with access to debugfs could use this to cause a denial of service

or possibly gain additional privileges. ([CVE-2018-9516](/security/CVE-2018-9516))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-lts-xenial](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-xenial) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Xenial for Trusty

## Details

USN-3879-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu

14.04 LTS.

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel could possibly perform an out of bounds write when updating the

journal for an inline file. An attacker could use this to construct a

malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2018-10883](/security/CVE-2018-10883))

Vasily Averin and Pavel Tikhomirov discovered that the cleancache subsystem

of the Linux kernel did not properly initialize new files in some

situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information. ([CVE-2018-16862](/security/CVE-2018-16862))

Wei Wu discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not

properly ensure that ioapics were initialized. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-19407](/security/CVE-2018-19407))

Mathias Payer and Hui Peng discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the

Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-19824](/security/CVE-2018-19824))

Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered that the USB subsystem in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle size checks when handling an extra USB

descriptor. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-20169](/security/CVE-2018-20169))

# USN-3878-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

4 February 2019

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.10](/security/notices?release=cosmic)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel
* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-gcp](/security/cves?package=linux-gcp) - Linux kernel for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) systems
* [linux-kvm](/security/cves?package=linux-kvm) - Linux kernel for cloud environments
* [linux-raspi2](/security/cves?package=linux-raspi2) - Linux kernel for Raspberry Pi 2

## Details

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the vsock address family

implementation of the Linux kernel that could lead to a use-after-free

condition. A local attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to

expose sensitive information (host machine kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-14625](/security/CVE-2018-14625))

Cfir Cohen discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the

KVM implementation of the Linux kernel, when handling interrupts in

environments where nested virtualization is in use (nested KVM

virtualization is not enabled by default in Ubuntu kernels). A local

attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to gain administrative

privileges in a host machine. ([CVE-2018-16882](/security/CVE-2018-16882))

Wei Wu discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not

properly ensure that ioapics were initialized. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-19407](/security/CVE-2018-19407))

It was discovered that the crypto subsystem of the Linux kernel leaked

uninitialized memory to user space in some situations. A local attacker

could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).

([CVE-2018-19854](/security/CVE-2018-19854))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux-aws-hwe](/security/cves?package=linux-aws-hwe) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS-HWE) systems
* [linux-gcp](/security/cves?package=linux-gcp) - Linux kernel for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) systems
* [linux-hwe](/security/cves?package=linux-hwe) - Linux hardware enablement (HWE) kernel

## Details

USN-3871-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 18.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 18.04 LTS for Ubuntu

16.04 LTS.

Wen Xu discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the ext4

filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10876](/security/CVE-2018-10876), [CVE-2018-10879](/security/CVE-2018-10879))

Wen Xu discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the ext4 filesystem

implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this to construct

a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-10877](/security/CVE-2018-10877))

Wen Xu discovered that an out-of-bounds write vulnerability existed in the

ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use

this to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10878](/security/CVE-2018-10878), [CVE-2018-10882](/security/CVE-2018-10882))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly ensure that xattr information remained in inode

bodies. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image

that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-10880](/security/CVE-2018-10880))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel could possibly perform an out of bounds write when updating the

journal for an inline file. An attacker could use this to construct a

malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2018-10883](/security/CVE-2018-10883))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the vsock address family

implementation of the Linux kernel that could lead to a use-after-free

condition. A local attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to

expose sensitive information (host machine kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-14625](/security/CVE-2018-14625))

Cfir Cohen discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the

KVM implementation of the Linux kernel, when handling interrupts in

environments where nested virtualization is in use (nested KVM

virtualization is not enabled by default in Ubuntu kernels). A local

attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to gain administrative

privileges in a host machine. ([CVE-2018-16882](/security/CVE-2018-16882))

Jann Horn discovered that the procfs file system implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly restrict the ability to inspect the kernel

stack of an arbitrary task. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-17972](/security/CVE-2018-17972))

Jann Horn discovered that the mremap() system call in the Linux kernel did

not properly flush the TLB when completing, potentially leaving access to a

physical page after it has been released to the page allocator. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash), expose

sensitive information, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-18281](/security/CVE-2018-18281))

Wei Wu discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not

properly ensure that ioapics were initialized. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-19407](/security/CVE-2018-19407))

It was discovered that the debug interface for the Linux kernel's HID

subsystem did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. An

attacker with access to debugfs could use this to cause a denial of service

or possibly gain additional privileges. ([CVE-2018-9516](/security/CVE-2018-9516))

### Reduce your security exposure

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# USN-3872-1: Linux kernel (HWE) vulnerabilities

29 January 2019

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)

## Packages

* [linux-hwe](/security/cves?package=linux-hwe) - Linux hardware enablement (HWE) kernel

## Details

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the vsock address family

implementation of the Linux kernel that could lead to a use-after-free

condition. A local attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to

expose sensitive information (host machine kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-14625](/security/CVE-2018-14625))

Cfir Cohen discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the

KVM implementation of the Linux kernel, when handling interrupts in

environments where nested virtualization is in use (nested KVM

virtualization is not enabled by default in Ubuntu kernels). A local

attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to gain administrative

privileges in a host machine. ([CVE-2018-16882](/security/CVE-2018-16882))

Wei Wu discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not

properly ensure that ioapics were initialized. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-19407](/security/CVE-2018-19407))

It was discovered that the crypto subsystem of the Linux kernel leaked

uninitialized memory to user space in some situations. A local attacker

could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).

([CVE-2018-19854](/security/CVE-2018-19854))

## Details

Wen Xu discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the ext4

filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10876](/security/CVE-2018-10876), [CVE-2018-10879](/security/CVE-2018-10879))

Wen Xu discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the ext4 filesystem

implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this to construct

a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-10877](/security/CVE-2018-10877))

Wen Xu discovered that an out-of-bounds write vulnerability existed in the

ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use

this to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10878](/security/CVE-2018-10878), [CVE-2018-10882](/security/CVE-2018-10882))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly ensure that xattr information remained in inode

bodies. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image

that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-10880](/security/CVE-2018-10880))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel could possibly perform an out of bounds write when updating the

journal for an inline file. An attacker could use this to construct a

malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2018-10883](/security/CVE-2018-10883))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the vsock address family

implementation of the Linux kernel that could lead to a use-after-free

condition. A local attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to

expose sensitive information (host machine kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-14625](/security/CVE-2018-14625))

Cfir Cohen discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the

KVM implementation of the Linux kernel, when handling interrupts in

environments where nested virtualization is in use (nested KVM

virtualization is not enabled by default in Ubuntu kernels). A local

attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to gain administrative

privileges in a host machine. ([CVE-2018-16882](/security/CVE-2018-16882))

Jann Horn discovered that the procfs file system implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly restrict the ability to inspect the kernel

stack of an arbitrary task. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-17972](/security/CVE-2018-17972))

Jann Horn discovered that the mremap() system call in the Linux kernel did

not properly flush the TLB when completing, potentially leaving access to a

physical page after it has been released to the page allocator. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash), expose

sensitive information, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-18281](/security/CVE-2018-18281))

Wei Wu discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not

properly ensure that ioapics were initialized. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-19407](/security/CVE-2018-19407))

It was discovered that the debug interface for the Linux kernel's HID

subsystem did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. An

attacker with access to debugfs could use this to cause a denial of service

or possibly gain additional privileges. ([CVE-2018-9516](/security/CVE-2018-9516))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel
* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-kvm](/security/cves?package=linux-kvm) - Linux kernel for cloud environments

## Details

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel could possibly perform an out of bounds write when updating the

journal for an inline file. An attacker could use this to construct a

malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2018-10883](/security/CVE-2018-10883))

Vasily Averin and Pavel Tikhomirov discovered that the cleancache subsystem

of the Linux kernel did not properly initialize new files in some

situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information. ([CVE-2018-16862](/security/CVE-2018-16862))

Wei Wu discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not

properly ensure that ioapics were initialized. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-19407](/security/CVE-2018-19407))

Mathias Payer and Hui Peng discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the

Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-19824](/security/CVE-2018-19824))

Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered that the USB subsystem in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle size checks when handling an extra USB

descriptor. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-20169](/security/CVE-2018-20169))

# USN-3878-2: Linux kernel (Azure) vulnerabilities

7 February 2019

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.10](/security/notices?release=cosmic)

## Packages

* [linux-azure](/security/cves?package=linux-azure) - Linux kernel for Microsoft Azure Cloud systems

## Details

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the vsock address family

implementation of the Linux kernel that could lead to a use-after-free

condition. A local attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to

expose sensitive information (host machine kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-14625](/security/CVE-2018-14625))

Cfir Cohen discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the

KVM implementation of the Linux kernel, when handling interrupts in

environments where nested virtualization is in use (nested KVM

virtualization is not enabled by default in Ubuntu kernels). A local

attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to gain administrative

privileges in a host machine. ([CVE-2018-16882](/security/CVE-2018-16882))

Wei Wu discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not

properly ensure that ioapics were initialized. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-19407](/security/CVE-2018-19407))

It was discovered that the crypto subsystem of the Linux kernel leaked

uninitialized memory to user space in some situations. A local attacker

could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).

([CVE-2018-19854](/security/CVE-2018-19854))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.10

* [linux-image-4.18.0-1008-azure](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-azure)
  -
  [4.18.0-1008.8](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-azure/4.18.0-1008.8)
* [linux-image-azure](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-azure)
  -
  [4.18.0.1008.9](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-azure/4.18.0-1008.8)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2017-18249

    A race condition was discovered in the disk space allocator of
    F2FS. A user with access to an F2FS volume could use this to cause
    a denial of service or other security impact.

CVE-2018-1128, CVE-2018-1129

    The cephx authentication protocol used by Ceph was susceptible to
    replay attacks, and calculated signatures incorrectly. These
    vulnerabilities in the server required changes to authentication
    that are incompatible with existing clients. The kernel's client
    code has now been updated to be compatible with the fixed server.

CVE-2018-3639 (SSB)

    Multiple researchers have discovered that Speculative Store Bypass
    (SSB), a feature implemented in many processors, could be used to
    read sensitive information from another context. In particular,
    code in a software sandbox may be able to read sensitive
    information from outside the sandbox. This issue is also known as
    Spectre variant 4.

    This update adds a further mitigation for this issue in the eBPF
    (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) implementation.

CVE-2018-5391 (FragmentSmack)

    Juha-Matti Tilli discovered a flaw in the way the Linux kernel
    handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote
    attacker can take advantage of this flaw to trigger time and
    calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithms by sending
    specially crafted packets, leading to remote denial of service.

    This was previously mitigated by reducing the default limits on
    memory usage for incomplete fragmented packets. This update
    replaces that mitigation with a more complete fix.

CVE-2018-5848

    The wil6210 wifi driver did not properly validate lengths in scan
    and connection requests, leading to a possible buffer overflow.
    On systems using this driver, a local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability could use this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or potentially for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-12896, CVE-2018-13053

    Team OWL337 reported possible integer overflows in the POSIX
    timer implementation. These might have some security impact.

CVE-2018-13096, CVE-2018-13097, CVE-2018-13100, CVE-2018-14614,
CVE-2018-14616

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported that crafted F2FS volumes
    could trigger a crash (BUG, Oops, or division by zero) and/or
    out-of-bounds memory access. An attacker able to mount such a
    volume could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-13406

    Dr Silvio Cesare of InfoSect reported a potential integer overflow
    in the uvesafb driver. A user with permission to access such a
    device might be able to use this for denial of service or
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-14610, CVE-2018-14611, CVE-2018-14612, CVE-2018-14613

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported that crafted Btrfs volumes
    could trigger a crash (Oops) and/or out-of-bounds memory access.
    An attacker able to mount such a volume could use this to cause a
    denial of service or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-15471 ((XSA-270)

    Felix Wilhelm of Google Project Zero discovered a flaw in the hash
    handling of the xen-netback Linux kernel module. A malicious or
    buggy frontend may cause the (usually privileged) backend to make
    out of bounds memory accesses, potentially resulting in privilege
    escalation, denial of service, or information leaks.

CVE-2018-16862

    Vasily Averin and Pavel Tikhomirov from Virtuozzo Kernel Team
    discovered that the cleancache memory management feature did not
    invalidate cached data for deleted files. On Xen guests using the
    tmem driver, local users could potentially read data from other
    users' deleted files if they were able to create new files on the
    same volume.

CVE-2018-17972

    Jann Horn reported that the /proc/*/stack files in procfs leaked
    sensitive data from the kernel. These files are now only readable
    by users with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (usually only root)

CVE-2018-18281

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the virtual memory manager
    that can result in a process briefly having access to memory after
    it is freed and reallocated. A local user could possibly exploit
    this for denial of service (memory corruption) or for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2018-18690

    Kanda Motohiro reported that XFS did not correctly handle some
    xattr (extended attribute) writes that require changing the disk
    format of the xattr. A user with access to an XFS volume could use
    this for denial of service.

CVE-2018-18710

    It was discovered that the cdrom driver does not correctly
    validate the parameter to the CDROM_SELECT_DISC ioctl. A user with
    access to a cdrom device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-19407

    Wei Wu reported a potential crash (Oops) in the KVM implementation
    for x86 processors. A user with access to /dev/kvm could use this
    for denial of service.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.144-3.1~deb8u1.  This version also includes fixes for Debian bugs
#890034, #896911, #907581, #915229, and #915231; and other fixes
