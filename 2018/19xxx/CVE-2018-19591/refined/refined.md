## Content from usn.ubuntu.com_9b7ab99c_20250125_124105.html

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The GNU C Library incorrectly handled certain hostname lookups.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect handling of hostname lookups leading to a crash.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker could cause the GNU C Library to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attacker performing hostname lookups.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Remote attacker needs to initiate hostname lookups.

## Content from sourceware.org_3adebbcc_20250125_124103.html

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A file descriptor leak in `if_nametoindex` when the 'ifname' parameter is too long and the descriptor is not closed. This occurs when processing `getaddrinfo` calls with crafted host names.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: File descriptor leak in `if_nametoindex`.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker using crafted 'node' parameters in `getaddrinfo()`  leads to descriptor exhaustion causing a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attacker crafting hostnames via the `getaddrinfo()` function to trigger descriptor leak.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to cause the vulnerable code to be called with crafted input.

## Content from security.netapp.com_658d7dc4_20250125_124102.html
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Versions of glibc through 2.28 are susceptible to a vulnerability.
