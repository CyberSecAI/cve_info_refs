Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of uploaded SVG files in the Monstra CMS. The application allows uploading SVG files, which can contain embedded JavaScript code. When a user views the uploaded SVG file, the embedded JavaScript code executes in the user's browser, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored XSS:** The vulnerability is a stored XSS, because the malicious script is stored on the server, and executed when a user access the file.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not sanitize or validate the contents of uploaded SVG files, allowing for the injection of malicious code.
- **Insecure File Handling:** The application directly serves the uploaded SVG file, allowing the browser to render it, and hence execute any embedded JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Theft:** An attacker could potentially steal sensitive information such as cookies or session data.
- **Redirection:** An attacker can redirect the victim to a malicious site.
- **Malicious Actions:** An attacker could perform actions on the victim's behalf within the context of the vulnerable site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload:** The attacker uploads a specially crafted SVG file containing malicious JavaScript.
- **File Access:** The victim accesses or previews the malicious SVG file through the application's interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the Monstra CMS, as the file upload is located in the admin panel.
- **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know how to craft an SVG file with malicious JavaScript code.
