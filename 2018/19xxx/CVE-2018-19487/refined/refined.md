Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-19487:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content from both themeforest.net and github.com directly mentions CVE-2018-19487 in relation to the "wp-jobhunt" plugin. The github repository is specifically created for exploiting this vulnerability. The themeforest changelog mentions the fix for this CVE. Therefore, the content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is a flaw in how the "wp-jobhunt" plugin handles AJAX requests. Specifically, the plugin fails to properly authorize or validate these requests, leading to unauthorized access to user information and the ability to reset user passwords.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **AJAX User Information Disclosure:** The plugin's AJAX functionality allows unauthenticated users to enumerate user information. This is due to lack of proper access controls on the AJAX endpoints.
*   **AJAX User Password Reset:**  The vulnerability permits unauthenticated users to trigger password reset for any user account through AJAX requests, without proper authorization or checks.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can obtain user information, like usernames, which can be used for further attacks.
*   **Account Takeover:** Attackers can reset user passwords, potentially gaining complete control over user accounts, including administrative accounts.
*   **Website compromise:** By taking over administrative accounts, attackers can compromise the entire WordPress website, leading to data breaches, defacement, or other malicious activities.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct AJAX Request Manipulation:** Attackers can directly craft and send malicious AJAX requests to the vulnerable endpoints to enumerate users or reset their passwords. The `exploit.py` script in the Github repository shows this attack vector.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.
*   **Basic understanding of HTTP:**  Attackers must be able to send HTTP requests and manipulate request parameters.
*   **No authentication required:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or access to the WordPress site.
