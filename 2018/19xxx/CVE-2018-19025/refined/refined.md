**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of special elements used in a command ('command injection').

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The device is vulnerable to command injection. An attacker can craft a packet that encodes an arbitrary command that can be executed on the vulnerable device (JUUKO K-808).

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the K-808 device.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is adjacent network. An attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device.
