# Reflected XSS in OAuth Authorize window due to redirect\_uri allowing arbitrary protocols

Link: <https://hackerone.com/reports/303405>
By: [@fransrosen](/fransrosen "Frans Ros√©n")

When creating an application as a user in a GitLab-instance, any user on the same instance can authorize the application. This means the Authorize-page can be shown for anyone with the content from the application one user has created.

When adding Callback-urls for an application, there's no validation for the protocol (most likely because it can be used for more than `http(s)`. The problem is that it now allows you to set a callback to

```
javascript://%250aalert(document.domain)
```

which is a valid URI to trigger the alert (since `//` means a comment in javascript and `%250a` is a URL-encoded new line.

So, creating an application as a regular user with the following info:

**Name**: Totally Legit App
**Redirect URI**: `javascript://%0aalert(document.domain)`

And then using the APP-id you get, creating the following URL (with your instance domain as prefix):

```
/oauth/authorize?client_id=[APP-ID]&redirect_uri=javascript://%250aalert(document.domain)&response_type=code&state=A
```

you will see this:

Clicking in this case on `Totally Legit App` will trigger the javascript:

### Mitigation

The proper mitigation to this is to prevent `data`, `vbscript` and `javascript` as protocols (make sure you check the protocol case-insensitive).

Regards,
Frans

## Impact

Even though this is per definition a stored XSS, it seems like the `redirect_uri` is forced to be in the URL with exact match, which gives away that there's something running and also converts a bit into a reflected XSS (since you cannot hide the payload). However, it actually doesn't trigger the XSS-auditor in Chrome, so the payload will still work for all browsers without any bypass.
