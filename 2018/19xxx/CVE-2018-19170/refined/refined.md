Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization on the `/starter-tomcat-1.0/admin/setting` page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to stored XSS. The provided payload `"><svg/onload=alert(1)>` is injected into a form field and stored in the database. When the page is rendered, the unsanitized payload is executed, triggering the alert.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application. This allows them to:
    - Steal user session cookies.
    - Redirect users to malicious sites.
    - Deface the application.
    - Perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable admin panel to inject the malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the admin panel of the application, specifically the settings page (`/starter-tomcat-1.0/admin/setting`).
- The attacker must have the ability to submit form data on that page.

**Additional Notes:**
- The report specifies that there were "three stored xss in the form", but only one payload and location were provided in the content.
- The provided images confirm the XSS injection and execution.
