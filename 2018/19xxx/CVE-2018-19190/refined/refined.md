Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of input sanitization in the Payfort PHP SDK. The SDK directly echoes user-supplied input from the `$_REQUEST` array in multiple PHP files (`success.php`, `route.php`, `error.php`) without proper encoding or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are present, categorized as both:
   - Reflected XSS: In `success.php` and `error.php` where parameters are directly reflected in the HTML output.
   - Stored XSS: Potentially in `route.php` when the `paymentMethod` parameter value is used within the `processRequest` method.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of these XSS vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:
   - Hijack the payment process.
   - Steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the user's browser.
   - Rewrite content of the HTML page.
   - Execute malicious scripts in the context of the user's browser.
   - Potentially redirect users to malicious websites, steal payment information, or perform other malicious actions.
   - Compromise PCI DSS compliance for websites using the vulnerable SDK.

**Attack vectors:**

The attack vectors include:
    - Crafted GET requests: Injecting malicious JavaScript payloads into URL parameters in `success.php` and `error.php`.
    - Crafted POST requests: Injecting malicious JavaScript payloads into the `paymentMethod` parameter in `route.php`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

   - The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the web server hosting the application using the vulnerable Payfort SDK.
   - No special privileges are required other than the ability to send HTTP requests.

**Additional notes:**
   - The article mentions that the `success.php` page, despite being intended for development purposes, should not have been publicly accessible and unvalidated as it led to a "VULNERABLE-BY-DESIGN" issue.
   - The article provides specific vulnerable file locations and line numbers.
   - The article states the vulnerability was reported to Amazon and was fixed.
   - The vulnerable SDK version is identified by the Github commit hash "703c96f".
   - The article contains a list of affected files and parameters and example payloads.
   - The article mentions that the vulnerabilities were reported and confirmed to be fixed by Amazon.
