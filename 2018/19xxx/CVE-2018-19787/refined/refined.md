Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-19787:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `lxml` library's failure to properly sanitize or remove JavaScript URLs that use encoding or escaping in HTML attributes. Specifically, the `lxml.html.clean` module's cleaner does not adequately remove `javascript:` URLs that use whitespace or character escaping (like `j\x01a\x02v\x03a\x04s\x05c\x06r\x07i\x0Ep t:` or `j a v a s c r i p t:`). This allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code into HTML documents.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Improper input sanitization:** The `lxml` library, specifically its HTML cleaning functionality, does not properly neutralize or remove malicious JavaScript URLs from HTML attributes when those URLs are encoded or include escaped characters.
- **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability allows for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code into a web page through HTML attributes, which can lead to XSS attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to:
  - Session hijacking.
  - Stealing cookies.
  - Defacement of web pages.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Other malicious actions.
- **Information disclosure:**  XSS can be used to steal sensitive information from the user such as keystrokes, stored authentication tokens, etc.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The attacker injects the malicious JavaScript URL through a vulnerable web application or service that uses `lxml` to process HTML.
- **User interaction:** The victim needs to view the malicious HTML document, which will then execute the injected JavaScript code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to find a way to inject the crafted HTML content (containing a malicious javascript URL in an attribute), which will be processed by the vulnerable `lxml` library in a target system.
- The attacker doesn't need any special privileges or system access, as the injection can typically be done through a normal web request.
- No user interaction is required on the server-side, it just processes the malicious input. The user interaction is passive, meaning the user just has to load/view the malformed HTML content.

**Additional details:**
- This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2014-3146, which also involved the bypassing of `lxml`'s HTML sanitization.
- The fix involves updating `lxml` to version 4.2.5 or higher. This version modifies the cleaning functions to properly remove javascript URLs even when they are encoded or contain escaped characters.
