Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper handling of certificate details within the `ERR_SECURE_CONNECT_FAIL` error page template. Specifically, the `%D` code, which expands to certificate details (including `%ssl_subject`, `%ssl_ca_name`, and `%ssl_cn`), was not properly escaped when rendered in the HTML context of the error page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. Because the certificate details were not HTML-escaped, a malicious HTTPS server could inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into the error page by crafting a certificate with malicious content in its subject, CA name, or common name fields.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary HTML Injection:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML into the error page displayed to the client. This could include malicious links, fake login forms, or other deceptive content.
*   **JavaScript Execution:** More seriously, the attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which would be executed in the context of the client's browser when the error page is displayed. This can lead to various attacks such as session hijacking, stealing credentials, redirecting to malicious websites, or other client-side exploits.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious HTTPS Server:** A malicious HTTPS server is required to trigger this vulnerability. The attacker controls the server and is able to craft a malicious certificate.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** While not explicitly stated, a MitM attacker could potentially intercept and modify a legitimate certificate to inject malicious content as well, though the primary attack vector is a malicious server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to control or compromise an HTTPS server.
*   The attacker must be able to manipulate the certificate presented by that server to the Squid proxy.
*   The attacker does not need any special access to the Squid server or the client system. The vulnerability is triggered by a standard HTTPS connection with a crafted certificate.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability is limited to Squid installations that are built with TLS/SSL support.
*   The `%D` macro is only populated with certificate details for the `ERR_SECURE_CONNECT_FAIL` error page. Other error pages are not vulnerable unless they also use the `%D` macro and are displaying TLS-related errors.
* The fix involves properly quoting/escaping the information retrieved from the remote certificates using the `%ssl_subject`, `%ssl_ca_name`, and `%ssl_cn` error details formatting codes.
* The advisory provides information on affected versions and workarounds, including removing the %D macro or building without SSL/TLS support.
