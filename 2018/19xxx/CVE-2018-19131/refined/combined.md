%ssl\_subject, %ssl\_ca\_name, and %ssl\_cn values were not properly escaped

when %D code was expanded in HTML context of the ERR\_SECURE\_CONNECT\_FAIL

template. This bug affects all ERR\_SECURE\_CONNECT\_FAIL page templates

containing %D, including the default template.

Other error pages are not vulnerable because Squid does not populate %D

with certificate details in other contexts (yet).

Thanks to Nikolas Lohmann [eBlocker] for identifying the problem.

TODO: If those certificate details become needed for ACL checks or other

non-HTML purposes, make their HTML-escaping conditional.

This is a Measurement Factory project.

| SSL Interception  Is this bug specific to intercepting Squids? Squid doing SslBump (a.k.a. SSL inspection)? Any Squid?  Injection into default ssl error page  Let's be explicit: ERR\_SECURE\_CONNECT\_FAIL.  However, this injection is not limited to the default ERR\_SECURE\_CONNECT\_FAIL page. It could happen whenever the admin uses `%D`, right? |

| However, this injection is not limited to the default ERR\_SECURE\_CONNECT\_FAIL page. It could happen whenever the admin uses %D, right?  Any error page which uses %D *and* there is a TLS error to be displayed which embeds a value from certificate field(s). Otherwise %D does not expand to anything useful. |

| [@chtsanti](https://github.com/chtsanti), if you have not asked Nikolas for permission to publish his name and company affiliation, please do so.  I remove his name for now, I am waiting his response.  Besides that, this PR is on your side -- as you probably know, it needs PR description fixes and an `M-cleared-for-merge` label.  OK.  However, this injection is not limited to the default ERR\_SECURE\_CONNECT\_FAIL page. It could happen whenever the admin uses %D, right?  Any error page which uses %D *and* there is a TLS error to be displayed which embeds a value from certificate field(s). Otherwise %D does not expand to anything useful.  Only in ERR\_SECURE\_CONNECT\_FAIL, only for this error we are completing the ErrorState::detail member which stores the error details. |

| [@chtsanti](https://github.com/chtsanti), FYI: The `M-failed-description` label is managed by [Anubis](https://github.com/measurement-factory/anubis#readme), not you. After the formatting was fixed, Anubis should have removed stale `M-failed-description` when revisiting this PR (it does not happen in real-time yet, unfortunately).  The only purple `M-` label that humans manage is `M-cleared-for-merge` (Amos set that for you in this PR AFAICT). |

| [@yadij](https://github.com/yadij), FYI: The line length limit is 72, not 65. The reason we keep *titles* at or below 65 characters is because the PR number gets auto-added to the title during merge commit formation (by GitHub or Anubis).

```
%ssl_subject, %ssl_ca_name, and %ssl_cn values were not properly escaped
when %D code was expanded in HTML context of the ERR_SECURE_CONNECT_FAIL
template. This bug affects all ERR_SECURE_CONNECT_FAIL page templates
containing %D, including the default template.

Other error pages are not vulnerable because Squid does not populate %D
with certificate details in other contexts (yet).

Thanks to Nikolas Lohmann [eBlocker] for identifying the problem.

TODO: If those certificate details become needed for ACL checks or other
non-HTML purposes, make their HTML-escaping conditional.

Squid Proxy Cache Security Update Advisory SQUID-2018:4
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Advisory ID: SQUID-2018:4
Date: October 28, 2018
Summary: Cross-Site Scripting issue
in TLS error processing.
Affected versions: Squid 3.1.12.1 -> 3.1.23
Squid 3.2.0.4 -> 3.5.28
Squid 4.0 -> 4.3
Fixed in version: Squid 4.4
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2018\_4.txt
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-19131
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Problem Description:
Due to incorrect input handling, Squid is vulnerable to a
Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability when generating HTTPS response
messages about TLS errors.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Severity:
This problem allows a malicious HTTPS server to trigger error
page delivery to a client and also inject arbitrary HTML code
into the resulting error response.
This problem is limited to Squid built with TLS / SSL support.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Updated Packages:
This bug is fixed by Squid version 4.4.
In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable
releases can be found in our patch archives:
Squid 3.5:
http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/changesets/squid-3.5-f1657a9decc820f748fa3aff68168d3145258031.patch
Squid 4:
http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v4/SQUID-2018\_4.patch
If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please refer
to the package vendor for availability information on updated
packages.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Determining if your version is vulnerable:
All Squid-2.x and older are not vulnerable.
All Squid-3.0 and older version are not vulnerable.
All Squid-3.x versions up to and including 3.4.14 built with
--disable-ssl are not vulnerable.
All Squid-3.x versions up to and including 3.4.14 built without
--enable-ssl are not vulnerable.
All Squid-3.1.12.1 and later versions up to and including
Squid-3.1.23 built with --enable-ssl are vulnerable.
All Squid-3.2.0.4 and later versions up to and including
Squid-3.2.14 built with --enable-ssl are vulnerable.
All Squid-3.3 and later versions up to and including
Squid-3.3.14 built with --enable-ssl are vulnerable.
All Squid-3.4 and later versions up to and including
Squid-3.4.14 built with --enable-ssl are vulnerable.
All Squid-3.5 versions up to and including 3.5.28 built without
--with-openssl are not vulnerable.
All Squid-3.5 and later versions up to and including 3.5.28 built
with --with-openssl are vulnerable.
All Squid-4 versions built without --with-openssl are not
vulnerable.
All Squid-4 versions up to and including 4.3 built with
--with-openssl are vulnerable.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Workarounds:
Either;
Remove %D error page macro from ERR\_SECURE\_CONNECT\_FAIL and any
custom error pages.
Or,
Build Squid-3.1 to 3.4.14 without "--enable-ssl"
Or,
Build Squid-3.5 or later without "--with-openssl"
