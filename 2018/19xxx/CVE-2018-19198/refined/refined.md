{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `uriComposeQuery*` and `uriComposeQueryEx*` functions of the `uriparser` library, where the handling of the '&' character in certain contexts leads to an out-of-bounds write.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially cause a denial of service or potentially achieve arbitrary code execution by exploiting this out-of-bounds write.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "By providing crafted input to `uriComposeQuery*` or `uriComposeQueryEx*` functions."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to control the input to the affected functions in the `uriparser` library."
