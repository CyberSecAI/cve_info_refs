{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by recursive calls within the `clone`, `cloneChildren`, and `copy` functions inside ast.cpp, which are part of the `IMPLEMENT_AST_OPERATORS` expansion. When parsing a crafted sass file, these recursive calls can lead to excessive stack consumption.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack overflow",
      "Uncontrolled recursion"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (application crash) due to stack exhaustion.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted Sass file"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a crafted Sass file. No specific user privileges are required. User interaction is required as the crafted file needs to be processed by the vulnerable application.",
   "description": "In LibSass prior to 3.5.5, functions inside ast.cpp for IMPLEMENT_AST_OPERATORS expansion allow attackers to cause a denial-of-service resulting from stack consumption via a crafted sass file, as demonstrated by recursive calls involving clone(), cloneChildren(), and copy()."
