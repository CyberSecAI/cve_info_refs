- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Unrestricted file upload combined with a lack of sanitization of user-provided SVG files. The CMS does not properly sanitize the SVG file, allowing malicious JavaScript to be embedded within it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
    - Unrestricted File Upload
    - Lack of input sanitization
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the uploaded SVG file. When the SVG file is opened or accessed by other users, the injected script can execute in their browser, potentially allowing the attacker to:
    - Steal cookies and session tokens
    - Access sensitive information
    - Perform actions on behalf of the victim
- **Attack vectors**:
    - The attack vector is through the file upload functionality of the CMS
    - The specific vulnerable endpoint is `/index.php?module=admin&act=dispModuleAdminFileBox`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrative privileges in the Rhymix CMS
    - The attacker needs to be able to upload files through the CMS's file upload function.
