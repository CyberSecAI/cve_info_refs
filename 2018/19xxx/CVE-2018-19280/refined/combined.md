# Centreon Web 18.10.0[Â¶](#centreon-web-18-10-0 "Permalink to this headline")

## New features[Â¶](#new-features "Permalink to this headline")

Centreon Remote Server is a new building-block in the Centreon distributed monitoring architecture. It comes in addition to the existing Centreon Central Server and Centreon Pollers.

Centreon Remote Server allows remote IT operations team to benefit from the full Centreon user experience, albeit on a subset of Centreon Pollers. Monitoring configuration takes place on the Central Server and is automatically synchronized with all Remote Servers. Monitoring Operations (Acknowledge, Downtimeâ¦) may take place both on a Remote Server or the Central Server.

In case of network link failure between a Remote Server and the Central Server, data retention takes place and the two Servers are synchronized as soon as the connection is up again.

Centreon Remote Server is integrated in Centreon Core. It fully replaces the Poller Display module.
