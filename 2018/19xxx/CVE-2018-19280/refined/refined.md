The provided document is a changelog for Centreon Web version 18.10.0. It lists several security fixes, including multiple XSS vulnerabilities and SQL injection issues.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The document lists multiple XSS issues in different parts of the application. These issues likely stem from insufficient sanitization or encoding of user-supplied data before displaying it on web pages.
- SQL injection vulnerabilities are also mentioned. These arise from constructing SQL queries using unescaped or unsanitized user input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerabilities:
  - ACL list page
  - Administration pages
  - Poller macros
  - Host, service, and downtime comments
  - Monitoring page
  - ACL Access Groups
- SQL Injection vulnerabilities:
  - Editing SNMP traps
  - Virtual metric functionality

**Impact of exploitation:**
- XSS vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of another user's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- SQL injection vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to bypass authentication, access or modify data, or even compromise the underlying database server.

**Attack vectors:**
- XSS vulnerabilities: An attacker would typically inject malicious scripts through user-controlled inputs, such as form fields or URL parameters.
- SQL injection vulnerabilities: An attacker would insert malicious SQL code into input fields or parameters that are used to construct database queries.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- For XSS vulnerabilities, an attacker needs to have the ability to inject malicious code into the application. This might involve exploiting a separate vulnerability or using social engineering to trick a user into clicking a malicious link.
- For SQL injection vulnerabilities, the attacker requires the ability to inject malicious SQL commands via a vulnerable user input.
