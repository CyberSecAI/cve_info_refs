The provided content describes two Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the SRCMS-dev application.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The application lacks CSRF protection on two critical POST methods: one for updating administrator credentials and another for modifying product prices.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CSRF:** The absence of CSRF tokens or other mechanisms allows an attacker to craft malicious requests that are executed in the context of an authenticated administrator's session when the administrator visits a malicious page.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Account takeover:** An attacker can change the super administrator's username and password, gaining full control over the application.
*   **Price manipulation:** An attacker can alter the prices of goods, potentially causing financial losses or other damage to the system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attacker lures the super administrator into visiting a malicious web page while they are logged into the application. The malicious page contains HTML forms that send crafted POST requests to the vulnerable endpoints.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in super administrator to visit a malicious webpage.
*   The attacker needs to know the application's structure, including the URLs and the parameters used to change user credentials and product prices.
