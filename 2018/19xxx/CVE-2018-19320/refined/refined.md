Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details for CVE-2018-19320:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is an exposed IOCTL (0xC3502808) in the GIO driver that provides a ring0 memcpy-like functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The driver allows non-privileged user processes to obtain a handle and issue IOCTL codes, enabling access to privileged operations.
- **Arbitrary Memory Read/Write:** The exposed IOCTL provides a mechanism to copy data to and from arbitrary memory locations in the system's address space.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** A local attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution in kernel mode (ring0).
- **Complete System Control:** The ability to read and write arbitrary memory gives the attacker complete control over the affected system.
- **System Instability:** The provided proof of concept demonstrates how this can cause a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD), leading to system crashes and instability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack must be launched locally on the affected system.
- **Driver Interaction:** The attacker interacts directly with the vulnerable driver (GIO) using the exposed IOCTL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a local user account on the system.
- **Ability to Run Code:** The attacker must be able to execute code on the system to interact with the driver.
- **No elevated privileges:** The attacker does not need prior elevated privileges to perform the attack.

**Technical Details from the Provided Proof of Concept:**

The Proof of Concept (PoC) provided demonstrates the arbitrary memory write using the IOCTL 0xC3502808.
- It first obtains a handle to the GIO driver
- Defines a structure `GIO_MemCpyStruct` which holds the destination address, the source address and size of the memory to copy
- The `GIO_memcpy` function uses `DeviceIoControl` with the `IOCTL_GIO_MEMCPY` code to trigger the memory copy.
- In the PoC `main` function, it sets `data` to an arbitrary value and calls `GIO_memcpy` to write this value to address `0`, causing the system to crash.
