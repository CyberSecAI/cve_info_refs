{
  "CVE-2018-19491": {
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in post.trm in Gnuplot 5.2.5. This issue allows an attacker to conduct a buffer overflow with an arbitrary amount of data in the PS_options function. This flaw is caused by a missing size check of an argument passed to the \"set font\" function. This issue occurs when the Gnuplot postscript terminal is used as a backend.",
    "Root cause": "Missing size check of an argument passed to the \"set font\" function in the `PS_options` function.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could cause a buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service attack or arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "The vulnerability is triggered when the Gnuplot postscript terminal is used as a backend and an overlong string is provided as an argument to the `set font` function."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker must be able to control the input to the `set font` function when the Gnuplot postscript terminal is used.",
    "Additional Information": "The vulnerability is located in the `post.trm` file. The fix involves adding a size check to the input string to prevent the overflow."
