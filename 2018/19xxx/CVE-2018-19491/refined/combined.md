Hash: SHA512

Package        : gnuplot
Version        : 4.6.6-2+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-19490 CVE-2018-19491 CVE-2018-19492

gnuplot, a command-line driven interactive plotting program, has been
examined with fuzzing by Tim Blazytko, Cornelius Aschermann, Sergej
Schumilo and Nils Bars.
They found various overflow cases which might lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.

Due to special toolchain hardening in Debian, CVE-2018-19492 is not
security relevant, but it is a bug and the patch was applied for the sake
of completeness. Probably some downstream project does not have the same
toolchain settings.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
4.6.6-2+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your gnuplot packages.

This issue allows an attacker to conduct a heap-based buffer overflow with an arbitrary amount of data in df_generate_ascii_array_entry. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must pass an overlong string as the right bound of the range argument that is passed to the plot function.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1117463#c0)  Robert Frohl   2018-11-27 12:27:24 UTC  ``` CVE-2018-19492  An issue was discovered in cairo.trm in Gnuplot 5.2.5. This issue allows an attacker to conduct a buffer overflow with an arbitrary amount of data in the cairotrm_options function. This flaw is caused by a missing size check of an argument passed to the "set font" function. This issue occurs when the Gnuplot pngcairo terminal is used as a backend.  References: <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-19492> <http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2018/CVE-2018-19492.html> <http://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2018-19492/> <https://sourceforge.net/p/gnuplot/bugs/2089/> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1117463#c1)  Robert Frohl   2018-11-27 12:38:09 UTC  ``` The changes are merged into one big patch for gnuplot 5.2 [0], for this case the changes to cairo.trm, metapost.trm and tgif.trm should be considered for this specific vulnerability.  The patch contains additional fixes for [bsc#1117465](http://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1117465), [bsc#1117464](http://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1117464) and additional issues that did not get a CVE assigned. It would be okay to apply the whole patch if that makes things easier.  Please note that there is a second commit for gnuplot 5.3, which is missing the changes for cairo.trm (should be d5020716834582b20a5e12cdd49f39ee4f9dd949)   [0] <https://sourceforge.net/p/gnuplot/gnuplot-main/ci/e3cc539c23ceb1640395236248f0ab5a26397557/> ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1117463#c2)  Robert Frohl   2018-11-27 12:51:21 UTC  ``` My investigation suggests that these codestreams are affected: - SUSE:SLE-15:Update/gnuplot - SUSE:SLE-12:Update/gnuplot  these are not affected: - SUSE:SLE-11:Update/gnuplot - SUSE:SLE-10-SP3:Update ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1117463#c3)  Dr. Werner Fink   2018-11-28 09:51:38 UTC  ``` (In reply to Robert Frohl from [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=1117463#c1)) > The changes are merged into one big patch for gnuplot 5.2 [0], for this case > the changes to cairo.trm, metapost.trm and tgif.trm should be considered for > this specific vulnerability. >  > The patch contains additional fixes for [bsc#1117465](http://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1117465), [bsc#1117464](http://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1117464) and > additional issues that did not get a CVE assigned.

IMHO this is a nogo  Yes, I still have not found a solution for SLE12. It is possible in newer ImageMagick versions as can be seen from following example:  <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/639367>  But for ImageMagick-6.8.8-1 even following does not work as I would expect:    <policy domain="coder" rights="write" pattern="PS" />   <policy domain="coder" rights="read" pattern="PS" />  (in one file) will disable reading/writing actually. Whether this is nogo or enabling PS coders is nogo you should ask rather security team ;). ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1117463#c7)  Dr. Werner Fink   2018-11-28 14:48:48 UTC  ``` (In reply to Petr Gajdos from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1117463#c6)) > Werner, you seem to be little bit impatient.

Another solution could perhaps be to create two conflicting packages providing the same file /etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml and the same symbol, e. g. ImageMagick-config and ImageMagick-config-insecure. Main package would then require the symbol. BuildRequired by gnuplot (and others) could be ImageMagick-config-insecure. Either ImageMagick-config-insecure would not be shipped at all or ImageMagick-config would be recommended by main package. Untested, and not sure I see all difficulties. ``` [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1117463#c19)  Petr Gajdos   2018-11-30 12:26:13 UTC  ``` I have now submitted solution described in [comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1117463#c17). security-team@, Let me know if you want try something else. ``` [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1117463#c21)  Marcus Meissner   2018-12-03 13:48:24 UTC  ``` The ImageMagick policy patch looks OK to me as far as I understand it. ``` [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=1117463#c22)  Marcus Meissner   2018-12-03 13:48:41 UTC  ``` good for us -> needinfo provided ``` [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1117463#c23)  Dr. Werner Fink   2018-12-03 13:59:28 UTC  ``` (In reply to Marcus Meissner from [comment #22](show_bug.cgi?id=1117463#c22)) > good for us -> needinfo provided  Hmmm ...where will the new version of ImageMagick be active in SUSE_SLE-12_Update ``` [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=1117463#c24)  Marcus Meissner   2018-12-04 07:21:39 UTC  ``` we will push an adjusted imagemagick to qa that can override policies via $HOME/.magick/policy.xml ``` [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=1117463#c27)  Swamp Workflow Management   2018-12-07 17:28:54 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2018:4023-1: An update that solves one vulnerability and has two fixes is now available.

# USN-4541-1: Gnuplot vulnerabilities

25 September 2020

Several security issues were fixed in Gnuplot.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [gnuplot](/security/cves?package=gnuplot) - Command-line driven interactive plotting program

## Details

Tim Blazytko, Cornelius Aschermann, Sergej Schumilo and Nils Bars

discovered that Gnuplot did not properly validate string sizes in the

df\_generate\_ascii\_array\_entry function. An attacker could possibly use

this issue to cause a heap buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of

service attack or arbitrary code execution. ([CVE-2018-19490](/security/CVE-2018-19490))

Tim Blazytko, Cornelius Aschermann, Sergej Schumilo and Nils Bars

discovered that Gnuplot did not properly validate string sizes in the

PS\_options function when the Gnuplot postscript terminal is used as a

backend. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a buffer

overflow, resulting in a denial of service attack or arbitrary code

execution. ([CVE-2018-19491](/security/CVE-2018-19491))

Tim Blazytko, Cornelius Aschermann, Sergej Schumilo and Nils Bars

discovered that Gnuplot did not properly validate string sizes in the

cairotrm\_options function when the Gnuplot postscript terminal is used as

a backend. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a buffer

overflow, resulting in a denial of service attack or arbitrary code

execution. ([CVE-2018-19492](/security/CVE-2018-19492))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1117464#c0)  Robert Frohl   2018-11-27 12:32:21 UTC  ``` CVE-2018-19491  An issue was discovered in post.trm in Gnuplot 5.2.5. This issue allows an attacker to conduct a buffer overflow with an arbitrary amount of data in the PS_options function. This flaw is caused by a missing size check of an argument passed to the "set font" function. This issue occurs when the Gnuplot postscript terminal is used as a backend.

In this case the changes to post.trm are significant.

Hash: SHA512

Package        : gnuplot5
Version        : 5.0.0~rc+dfsg2-1+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-19490 CVE-2018-19491 CVE-2018-19492

```
gnuplot5, a command-line driven interactive plotting program, has been
examined with fuzzing by Tim Blazytko, Cornelius Aschermann, Sergej
Schumilo and Nils Bars.
They found various overflow cases which might lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.
```

```
Due to special toolchain hardening in Debian, CVE-2018-19492 is not
security relevant, but it is a bug and the patch was applied for the sake
of completeness. Probably some downstream project does not have the same
toolchain settings.
```

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
5.0.0~rc+dfsg2-1+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your gnuplot5 packages.
