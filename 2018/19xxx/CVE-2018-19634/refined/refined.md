- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper implementation of survey access control.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated access to survey information allowing submission without any authentication
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can access and submit survey information without authentication. This may lead to manipulation of survey data and potentially gathering of sensitive or unintended information.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote access
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be remote and does not need any authentication to access/submit survey data.
