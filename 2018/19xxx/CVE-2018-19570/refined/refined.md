{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The markdown editor in GitLab does not properly sanitize user-provided input, allowing for the insertion of a malicious link within an unclosed HTML tag.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cross-site Scripting (XSS)",
     "Improper input sanitization"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other authenticated GitLab users who click on the malicious link. This can lead to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects a malicious payload into the markdown editor via a link embedded in an unclosed tag in issue descriptions, comments, or snippets.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to submit content to the markdown editor, which is possible through issue descriptions, comments, and snippets."
