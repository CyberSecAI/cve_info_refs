- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of confidential issue references within commit messages leads to information exposure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Leaking of private namespace and titles of confidential issues through commit messages.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized users can gain access to the private namespace of a project and the titles of its confidential issues, potentially revealing sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - An attacker creates a commit message that links to a confidential issue within a private project that they do not have explicit access to.
    - The attacker then views the commit on a public page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to create commits and view commit pages. They do not need direct access to the private project or confidential issue, but they must know the issue's reference to include in the commit message.
