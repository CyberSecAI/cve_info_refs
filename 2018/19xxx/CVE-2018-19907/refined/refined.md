The provided content relates to CVE-2018-19907.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Server-Side Template Injection in Crafter CMS due to the use of FreeMarker library to render webpages.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a Server-Side Template Injection. Attackers can inject arbitrary code into template files (.ftl files) which are then processed by the FreeMarker template engine, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the server hosting the Crafter CMS instance. This can lead to full server compromise, data breaches, malware deployment, and denial-of-service attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the template editing/creation functionality of the Crafter CMS. Attackers with sufficient privileges (authenticated users) can modify template files by injecting malicious code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attackers need to be authenticated users of the Crafter CMS with permissions to create or edit templates.
- The attacker can be in any position as long as they have an account and editing/creating rights, regardless of network location, within the system.
