Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**

The core issue is that several chain-based Proof-of-Stake (PoS) cryptocurrencies, which are forks of Bitcoin, do not adequately validate block data, particularly the "coinstake" transaction, before committing resources like RAM and disk space. This is a flaw in the implementation of the "headers-first" feature that was adopted from Bitcoin. In Bitcoin, proof-of-work serves as an initial check to prevent resource exhaustion. This check does not translate well to PoS. The coinstake transaction is not present in the header, so nodes cannot validate the header on its own using PoS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Lack of Coinstake Validation:**
    *   Vulnerable cryptocurrencies do not validate the coinstake transaction in block headers before storing them in memory (RAM).
    *   Similarly, when receiving a block, the coinstake transaction is not validated before the block is stored to disk.
2.  **Incomplete Validation of Spent Outputs:**
    *   Some implementations check if the coin being spent exists in the main chain's transaction database (TxDB) but not whether the coin is unspent.
    *   When validating blocks, the coinstake transaction is checked against the TxDB of the main chain, even if the block is on a fork, not its own chain.
3.  **Stake Amplification:**
    *   Attackers can amplify their apparent stake by creating multiple transactions that spend coins back to themselves. Due to incomplete validations, these already spent coins are still considered valid when staking, increasing an attacker's chance of creating a valid PoS block.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Resource Exhaustion (RAM):** Attackers can fill up a victim node's RAM with bogus block headers, causing the node to crash.
*   **Resource Exhaustion (Disk):** Attackers can fill up a victim's disk by sending chains of fake blocks, requiring manual intervention to clean up the storage.
*   **Chain Split:** Some mitigation techniques, such as partial validation up to a fixed length, introduce the risk of chain splits, making nodes unable to agree on a common view of the blockchain.
*   **Eclipse Attacks:** Chain splits can be combined with eclipse attacks to lead honest nodes to an attacker-controlled chain.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Peers:** Attackers only need to establish a network connection to the victim.
*   **Maliciously Crafted Blocks/Headers:** The attack involves sending invalid chains of headers/blocks that pass initial checks but are actually bogus.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Initial Stake Required:** For the RAM and disk exhaustion attacks (vulnerability #1), no stake is required.
*   **Minimal Stake Required:** The spent stake attack (vulnerability #2) requires a minimal amount of stake, which can be later sold back after the stake has been amplified.
*   **Network Connection:** Attackers need only a network connection to the victim's node.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerabilities affect cryptocurrencies forked from Bitcoin version 0.10.0 or later, which incorporated the "headers first" feature.
*   The attacks were tested on live networks, confirming their feasibility.
*   Coordinated vulnerability disclosure was initiated to notify development teams of the affected cryptocurrencies, and many have deployed mitigations.
*   Mitigations implemented include heuristics for detecting malicious peers and limiting the depth of fork blocks that can be accepted, although these introduce other potential issues such as chain splits.
*   Full validation of off-main-chain blocks is a long-term mitigation goal.
*   The provided article notes the vulnerability was assigned CVE numbers however those are not specified in the content.
