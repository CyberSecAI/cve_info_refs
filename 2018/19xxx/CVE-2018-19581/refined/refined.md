Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Summary:**
A guest user, who normally has limited permissions, can set the weight of a new issue by manipulating the POST request when submitting it. This is due to a lack of server-side validation that prevents guests from setting the 'weight' parameter.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper server-side authorization checks when a new issue is submitted. While the UI restricts guest users from directly setting the weight, the backend doesn't enforce this restriction, allowing a malicious guest to manipulate the request and set the weight.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate input validation on the server-side.
- Insufficient authorization checks.
- Reliance on UI restrictions for security

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Guest users can manipulate issue metadata (specifically the weight) that is not intended for them to control.
- While the impact is considered low, it represents a deviation from expected behavior and can be used to cause confusion or skew the issue tracking system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Intercepting the HTTP request when a guest creates a new issue.
- Modifying the POST request by adding the `issue[weight]` parameter with a desired value.
- Submitting the modified request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be a guest user in a GitLab project.
- The attacker needs the ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests, usually using a web proxy tool.
