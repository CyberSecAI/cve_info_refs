Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described:

**1. Arbitrary File Upload**

*   **Root Cause:** The "create survey" function in Interspire Email Marketer allows users to upload files without proper validation when the "allow all file types" option is enabled.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Lack of file type validation: The system does not restrict the types of files that can be uploaded, allowing for the upload of malicious files like webshells.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can upload and execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially gaining full control of the system.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker uses the "create survey" function with the "allow all file type" option enabled to upload a malicious file. They then access the file via the generated URL.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the function. This can be achieved through a valid user account or by exploiting CVE-2017-14322 to bypass authentication on older versions.

**2. SQL Injection (4 vulnerabilities)**

*   **Root Cause:**  Improper handling of user-supplied input in `Dynamiccontenttags.php` leads to SQL injection vulnerabilities in multiple functions. The code constructs SQL queries through string concatenation, making it vulnerable to injection attacks.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   SQL Injection: Vulnerable functions include `checkduplicatetags`, `deleteblock`, `delete tags`, and `updateblock`.
    *   String concatenation is used to build SQL queries.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially allowing them to read, modify, or delete database data, bypass authentication, or even gain control of the database server.
*   **Attack Vector:** By crafting malicious input, an attacker can inject SQL commands into the vulnerable queries.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Authentication is required to reach these functions. This can be achieved through a valid user account or by exploiting CVE-2017-14322 to bypass authentication on older versions.

**Summary**

The provided content details two main categories of vulnerabilities in Interspire Email Marketer: an arbitrary file upload vulnerability and multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities. The file upload vulnerability allows for direct code execution through webshell uploads, while the SQL injection issues expose the database. Both vulnerabilities require authentication, which could potentially be bypassed using CVE-2017-14322 if older versions are targeted.
