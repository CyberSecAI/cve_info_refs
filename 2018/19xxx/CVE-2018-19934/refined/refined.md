Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2018-19934:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the SolarWinds Serv-U FTP Server, specifically within URL paths and HTTP POST parameters. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to the failure to sanitize user-supplied input in:
  - URL paths
  - HTTP POST parameters

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser.
- This can lead to actions such as:
  - Session hijacking
  - Defacement of web pages
  - Redirection to malicious sites
  - Other client-side attacks

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vectors involve crafting malicious URLs or POST requests containing JavaScript code.
- These crafted requests are then sent to the vulnerable Serv-U FTP server.
- When the server processes these requests, the unsanitized script is reflected back to the user's browser, leading to the execution of the injected script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs or POST requests.
- The attacker needs to trick a legitimate, authenticated administrator of the Serv-U FTP server to click on a malicious link or to submit a crafted HTTP request.
- The vulnerability is triggered in the administrative interface; therefore, the attacker is likely targeting administrators.

**Technical details:**
* Injection points:
    * URL Path: `/Admin/XML` and `/Admin/XML/Result.xml`
    * HTTP POST Parameter: `/Admin/XML/SMTPResult.xml` ('SMTPServer' parameter)
* Example malicious URLs:
    * `/Admin/XML/Result.xml%22%3balert('XSS!')//xxx?Command=DismissWhatsNew`
    * `/Admin/XML%22%3balert('XSS!')//xxx/Result.xml?Command=DismissWhatsNew`
* The vulnerability was tested on version 15.1.6.25 and fixed in Serv-U 15.1.6 hotfix 3
