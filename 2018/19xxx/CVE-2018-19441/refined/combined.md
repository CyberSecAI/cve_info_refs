[00:00] >>How many people here like
cleaning their house? No? Oh
wow, this is a weird crowd, holy
[00:06] cow. So um, I don’t like
cleaning my house. I don’t like
running a vacuum. I recently had
[00:12] a small child, um, which I
thought would be effective. Um,
he has now started to crawl, I’m
[00:17] like, yes! Human Roomba. But I
quickly discovered that the
problem is, you can’t just put
[00:23] like a- like a- like a cloth or
a towel on the bottom of him
and- and have it be like a dust
[00:27] cloth running around, because he
starts to eat the things. And
that’s- and then it’s going to
[00:31] break the human robot vacuum.
So, maybe I’ll have one of these
vacuums in my future, or, based
[00:38] on what we’re about to hear, nn
probably not. Let’s give Fabian
and Jiska a big round of
[00:43] applause. They came all the way
from Germany to talk to you
about silly little robot
[00:46] vacuums. Let’s give them a round
of applause. [Applause]
>>Welcome to our talk about uh
[00:55] vacuum cleaners. And it will be
about a lot of iot components
including the cloud and the
[01:01] actual hardware. This is Fabian,
working at ERNW and I’m from the
Secure Mobile Networking Lab.
[01:07] So, why does it matter? Um, um,
um, vacuum cleaning robot
actually has access to your home
[01:13] wifi and it knows a lot of your
personal habits like um, when
are you at home, when are you at
[01:19] work, how many people live in
your apartment, how big it is,
uh, do you have cats, children,
[01:24] partners. Um, and my question to
you is who of you owns a vacuum
cleaning robot? Quite a few. And
[01:31] now maybe some hands going down,
who of you like, have like their
own? Not owning someone’s on the
[01:36] internet but like really owning
your own vacuum robot. Ah, less
hands yeah. Okay, um so we um
[01:42] chose actually the Neato
ecosystem to analyse and uh- we
are from Germany and in Germany
[01:50] um- these are just relabeled by
Vorwerk and um- they are selling
vacuum cleaners since 1929 or
[01:58] something. Um- and their top
model is actually a rebranded
Neato and it always wins the
[02:03] test competitions because it has
like rainbow colored LEDs. The
Neato hasn’t. And- and a green
[02:08] brush and a few more sensors,
yeah. Um- so we did responsible
disclosure, and the most uh-
[02:14] urgent uh- stuff was really
fixed in time and also more
fixes coming out. Um- no
[02:20] customer data was leaked, but
robots were harmed during our
experiments. Sorry for this- so
[02:25] this is how the lab looked in
between doing those experiments.
So the infrastructure, um- each
[02:32] uh- robot has actually a user
interface and also some usb
console for some basic
[02:36] debugging. Um- then you have a
smart phone app which can run
some manual robot commands but
[02:42] this is not for cleaning your
house so this is just a very
basic thing going on there. Um-
[02:47] so you actually need to pair it
with a user account and the user
account is in the Beehive cloud.
[02:52] Um- and during setup you setup
this account and link it to the
robot. And then there is a
[02:57] second cloud, a Nucleo cloud,
because everything is better
with two clouds, obviously. And,
[03:02] so this second cloud is somehow
connected to the Beehive cloud,
we don’t know how exactly um-
[03:06] because we cannot sniff there.
Um- but um- it is- the Nucleo
cloud is used used um- for
[03:12] example starting the cleaning
process, getting back a map
report uh- about the cleaning.
[03:19] And there is a lot of security
going on there. So the robot
itself has like secure boot and
[03:23] encrypted logs, signed firmware
updates, so we tried flipping
bits and then everything else
[03:28] actually has like HTTPS and
special RSA keys between the
robot and the cloud, and then a
[03:35] secret key between the robot and
the user so really everything is
being done there. So you would
[03:40] say like, why did- why are we
even giving a talk about this,
what could go wrong? Um- and I
[03:44] have to say a lot can go wrong.
So we managed to bypass the
secure boot and extract the
[03:50] image of the robot and our key
findings are key findings. And
we also did um- a QNX side
[03:58] quest. Uh- and we were able to
gain unauthenticated remote
executions on the robots over
[04:04] the cloud. So the secure bypass,
uh- actually works that you can
put the robot in a test mode,
[04:10] reboot it, and then you would
get a special boot loader and
that special boot loader only
[04:15] takes QNX IFS so a very
proprietary thing, but if you
manage to compile this then you
[04:20] can dump all of the RAM to the
serial port and um- if you load
it to a special region then you
[04:26] can readout the original image.
And in this image of Neato, of
the robot, um- there is two
[04:32] processes that are very
important. The first one is a
watchdog called Pinky, and also
[04:37] cleaning logic, which is called
Brain. That’s why we have this
funny subtitle with Pinky and
[04:42] Brain. >>Alright so I will now
talk about the key findings. So
first of all I have to explain
[04:50] what the keys do in particular.
So we have the secret key. The
secret key is uh- unique for one
[04:53] robot user account connection
and it’s uh- computed by the
robot on first linkage to user
[04:55] account. And it’s used to
authenticate commands to the
robots. So, if you want to start
[04:57] cleaning or anything like that
you have to authenticate this
request using the secret key.
[04:59] And the secret key is known by
the robot, um- the smart
application, and also the cloud.
[05:14] And um- the authentication works
with an HTTP header, which is
just a basic authen- uh-
[05:22] authorization header in HTTP,
led by the NEATOAPP string and
then a signature. The signature
[05:28] just takes in the serial number
of the robot and the current
date of the request and um- the
[05:33] message body so, the command.
And this is then uh- hashed with
the HMAC SHA 256 um- with um-
[05:41] the secret key as the key
component. The second uh- key
that is used in the
[05:46] infrastructure is the RSA key.
Um- so we need a second key
because the robots have to at
[05:52] some point exchange um- the
secret key with the cloud for
authentication of the commands,
[05:58] so the robots themselves need to
have another set of keys to
authenticate against the cloud.
[06:03] And also the secret key is not
that secret because several
parties know it. We know that
[06:08] the smart application has it,
therefor the user can extract it
and everything. Um- so this RSA
[06:12] key is for authenticating the
robot against the cloud. And
this works similar to the secret
[06:19] key. Um- we have um-
authorization header in HTTP
again, um- led by the niet-
[06:24] NEATOBOT string and the serial
number of the robot uh- followed
by a signature. The signature
[06:29] this time is over a little more
data. It’s the robot’s serial
again, um- the current HTTP
[06:35] method, the URI of the request,
um- the current date and the
body. And this is then signed
[06:42] with the RSA SHA 256. Okay, so
now, what- what’s going wrong?
Um- we have um- this excerpt of
[06:53] the secret key computation. It’s
a little bit simplified but
I’ll- we’ll walk you through.
[06:58] Um- so first of all we have this
random value, that is just a
random value. An then we have
[07:03] this uh- 16 byte time shift
variable. And this is later then
used by the SHA1 hashing so the
[07:10] secret keys themselves are
basically SHA1 hashes. A little
shorter than that but it’s a
[07:14] SHA1 hash. So they look pretty
nice and the entropy is really
good because we all know SHA1 is
[07:19] pretty sane. Um- so now it’s um-
important to see um- what the
bits and this uh- and the bytes
[07:27] in this time shift variable are.
So the first four bytes are the
current time. Well, we know that
[07:32] the time is often used in
cryptography. It’s not that
good, but we also have seen
[07:40] worse so okay. But then we have
some constant values, I don’t
know why but okay. So zero is a
[07:45] great number, as well as 16. And
then we actually use the random
numbers. So the uh- byte number
[07:52] 8 of the time shift variable is
um- some computation with a
random value. And then we have
[07:57] the next byte which is also some
computation with a random value,
but this time we- we do some
[08:01] math where we actually lose some
entropy because six bit is
enough for a byte, so why not.
[08:07] And the last uh- six bytes then
are the robot’s MAC address.
And, while the robot’s MAC
[08:13] address is not exactly secret
because the robot’s serial
number consists of the date of
[08:19] production, followed by the
robot’s MAC address. And this
one is printed on the packaging
[08:23] of the robot, and while- on Ebay
you can see people uh- doing
photographs of the packaging and
[08:28] then you have the serial number.
Uh- also I mean it’s a MAC
address, so it’s on the network,
[08:32] it’s not that secret. And when
the robot is first plugged in it
also opens a wifi access point
[08:39] to uh- provision it. And this
wifi access point’s name also is
the robot’s MAC address. Okay,
[08:45] the MAC address doesn’t provide
any security. The constants
obviously don’t as well. Um- now
[08:50] the random values. Um- this is
not much randomness but at least
some but, there’s another
[08:57] problem because the random
generator actually looks like
this. [laughter] This is because
[09:05] they forgot to seat the random
number generator and this means
if you have a robot that’s
[09:10] freshly booted or freshly
unpackaged, um- it always
returns the same random number,
[09:15] which thereby is not, only a
number. And the number we
printed here is actually the
[09:19] number that robot um- the
NeatoBot um- botvac connect D7’s
take as the first random number.
[09:26] Um- yeah so okay. We don’t have
any entropy except for the time
now, so the current timestamp.
[09:33] Now the question is how much
entropy does the unix timestamp
provide. And, therefore we have
[09:38] some numbers for if an attacker
knows about one year exact about
when the robot was first linked
[09:43] to the cloud, that’s actually 25
bit of entropy. And if the
attacker knows this about one
[09:49] hour exact, it’s only 12 bit of
entropy. And you only 12 bit of
entropy is nothing. You can
[09:54] bruteforce this against the
cloud. And um- there also is
some other attacks against uh-
[10:00] the secret keys, because you can
sniff some uh- authorization
headers and thereby do an
[10:05] offline attack, and with an
offline attack, 25 bit also is
nothing. It’s like minutes, or
[10:10] even seconds. And um- yeah so
this is not that secure. You
also can think of uh- of uh- a
[10:18] social engineering scenario
where I just come over to him
and say hey, I’m from the Neato
[10:22] customer support, uh- please
reconnect your robot to the
cloud, and now I know the
[10:26] timestamp exactly, and now I now
everything for the secret key
computation and I’m able to
[10:31] actually compute the secret key
and send arbitrary commands to
the robot. Okay, so much for the
[10:38] secret keys. Now, the RSA keys.
So um- we found um- them on the
robot’s file system slash var
[10:44] slash keys. There is this nice
file called vendor private key
production. So this sounds
[10:49] pretty promising. Um- it is
encrypted at least but um- in
banner it’s just some string
[10:56] obfuscation and then, after some
de-obfuscation we the password.
And uh- yeah. So we then figured
[11:04] out that the RSA key is the same
for all robots, because
obviously for a public key
[11:10] infrastructure you want to have
the same key on every robot, why
not? Um- this leads to the
[11:16] scenario where an attacker is
just able to talk to the cloud
and say, hey, by the way I’m a
[11:21] robot and the cloud says okay,
it’s fine. And um- if you recode
the authoriz- the
[11:27] authentication, that uh- the
robots do with the cloud. The
Neatobot string, followed by the
[11:33] serial number and the signature,
and the only way single robots
get identified is this first
[11:39] string which is the serial
number so if I know the private
key I can just send arbitrary
[11:44] requests with arbitrary serial
numbers in the request and I can
impersonate arbitrary robots. So
[11:49] I can be any robot I want to be.
And, this is bad. Um- there are
a lot of attacks that we can
[11:57] execute on this but I will
present maybe yeah- a nice one I
think because it’s actually- we
[12:05] are able to leak the victim’s
smartphone IP address. Um-
because like Jiska mentioned
[12:09] before, we have this manual
driving mode, where we can
directly control the robot by
[12:14] pressing some buttons on the
smartphone and the robot
directly drives like that. Um-
[12:18] and what happens here is that
the smartphone asks the Nucleo-
Nucleo cloud what’s the robot’s
[12:24] network location is. And Nucleo
cloud then asks us, because we
are now the robot, uh- what the
[12:30] robot’s network location is.
Also the robot itself doesn’t
get any requests anymore because
[12:35] only the last recent robot that
locked into the cloud is getting
requests. So we can just kick
[12:41] the other robot and we get the
requests. And- well we then
answer an arbitrary port and IP
[12:47] address location to the cloud,
and the cloud then happily
forwards this to the smartphone.
[12:53] And, well who would have
guessed, the smartphone just
connects to this IP in part, um-
[12:58] so thereby we obtain the public
IP of the smartphone, we can now
do some things like geolocation
[13:04] lookups and know pretty exactly
where this person is. Also this
opens a channel from the
[13:10] smartphone so if there is any
firewall or something like that,
it’s an outgoing connection,
[13:13] it’s fine. Um- and yeah, we- we
have a port open and maybe we
can do some more stuff with the
[13:19] smartphone even. So this could
be a nice attack vector against
the smartphone. And yeah- I
[13:24] don’t think that this should be
possible. Um- yeah. Alright, so,
a little QNX uh- sidequest. Uh-
[13:33] as Jiska mentioned, um- the
robot is running on QNX 6.5 and
this has some, it’s an older
[13:41] system of QNX, um- so just for
those of you who don’t know QNX,
it’s a um- root operating system
[13:46] by Blackberry and um- it’s
actually running in cars, it’s
running in power plants, and
[13:52] some critical applications. Um-
but like I mentioned, this
version is pretty old, there’s-
[13:57] meanwhile there’s some 7.x
version and pretty updated and
more secure now. Um- but this
[14:04] old version has some nice
default settings like for
example, ASLR and DEP are just
[14:10] turned off by default, because,
whoever needs that? I don’t
know. And um- but that’s not
[14:16] all. We just stumbled upon
something nice when we looked
into the robots. Because, um-
[14:22] this- this proc fs file system
on QNX, it’s just like a nor-
the normal proc fs you have on
[14:28] almost every UNIX system. It’s
like um- the process memory of
arbitrary processes is mapped in
[14:35] the file system so that root or
anyone can read this memory of
the processes and also write to
[14:40] it maybe. And um- the problem
with the older QNX versions is
that actually the Umask that is
[14:47] set for this um- proc fs file
system pretty sure it allows
arbitrary users to read
[14:52] arbitrary process memory. So um-
it doesn’t matter if you are
just a normal user or if you are
[14:58] root, you can read any process
memory and this is a real
problem if we look into
[15:00] privileged processes, like for
example this Ubinary. This
Ubinary is used, as you might
[15:02] know to change the currently
authorized user of the system
and, well therefore it has to
[15:04] check my authentication and this
is a password authentication
normally. And to get the
[15:18] password authentication right it
has to read in the etc shadow
file, which is a privileged
[15:23] file. It normally isn’t
readable. Um- and what a hacker
can do is he can invoke this
[15:28] Ubinary to gain root privileges
and he doesn’t know the password
but that’s not important because
[15:33] he just reads the process memory
of the SU process all the time,
until that very moment where the
[15:39] etc shadow file is read in, and
he then just has- all the
information that uh- is uh-
[15:44] written in the etc shadow file
and now, then he can try to
correct this and obtain the root
[15:49] password. This of course isn’t
limited to uh- the etc shadow
file, you can- or the SU
[15:54] process. You can do this with
any privileged process. You can
extract uh- SSL keys of- of
[15:59] processes or just read any data
that any privileged process you
can execute on the system is
[16:03] able to read. Alright. >>So um-
we looked a bit more into uh-
the connection to the cloud and
[16:16] uh- did some fuzzing in the very
beginning, and um- I discovered
a crash lock and decrypted it
[16:22] with one of the logger keys of
the image. Um- so actually there
is an astro binary and this is
[16:27] uh- connected to the Nucleo
cloud, and then passes commands
to the robot binary. And within
[16:33] this astro connection, there is
a buffer overflow that can be
triggered with this url. And,
[16:39] the interesting part here is
that um- we found that the
buffer overflow is happening
[16:45] when the authentication header
is parsed, which means um- there
is no authentication because we
[16:51] are exploiting the
authentication itself. So we
have an unauthenticated remote
[16:55] code execution on the bin astro,
and well luckily we don’t even
need this QNX side quest because
[17:01] all services run as root. That’s
very nice. Uh- and the fix for
this is by now Neato is um-
[17:07] validating the authentication
headers in cloud so that this is
no longer happening. Uh- yeah,
[17:13] so- but it was very nice to like
control any robot if you had the
serial ID. Security
[17:21] implications. So if you have an
IOT product at home, try to keep
it offline. This is often not
[17:26] possible so you might use your
personal like second wifi or
something and not the one for
[17:31] the other devices. Um- as a
customer, you should really
update your robot so it’s not
[17:36] just um- because security, they
also have some nice new
features, but also for the
[17:42] security of course. And you saw
that the most particular part
here is the serial number, so
[17:47] you need to hide this one, so if
you have friends visiting, hide
your robot so that they cannot
[17:51] read it. It’s printed on the
bottom. Um- or it’s just put on
a tin foil hat or something to
[17:57] help yourself. Um- the second
part for the security implement-
uh- implications here is that
[18:04] for developers, it’s really
important that security is done
not just by hitting all the buzz
[18:09] words, like, oh yeah we have uh-
RSA, RNG, hashing, secure boot,
encrypted logs, blah blah blah.
[18:14] Um- but the important part here
is that you have decision for
the root of trust so that you
[18:20] think about what is the trusted
components in your IOT network.
And a very important part here
[18:26] is that dissecting one of your
robots should not um- harm the
security of any other component,
[18:32] so you should always consider a
student having a lot of time
dissecting one vacuum cleaner
[18:36] for half a year and then
exploiting whatever. Uh- and you
should put a lot of time into
[18:42] uh- testing the- the root of
trust. So for example this
random function, if you would
[18:44] have tested it in practice
before the hashing, then you
could have probably seen this
[18:46] uh- in practice that it does not
work and just returns the same
time always. So um- we still
[18:48] have some time left for Q and A,
and thank you for listening.
[applause] So, I don’t- it’s
[18:56] hard to see people there. Yeah,
really? No questions? Great.
Yeah. Down- Down here yes? Yes,
[19:34] what is your question?
>>[inaudible] >>Ah, yeah. So the
question is if hiding your MAC
[19:45] address versus hiding your
serial, if there’s a difference.
Um- yes it is because uh- the
[19:51] other part of um- the serial is
also the production date. I mean
it can be guessed, but overall
[19:58] it’s harder. And for the MAC
address- to know the MAC
address, you need to be either
[20:02] in the same network, for
example, or you need to be uh-
so you have to be physically
[20:08] close, for example when you
start the robot and it’s like
making this pairing access point
[20:13] and so on. Very serious in
there. So um- for getting remote
control, the attack vector gets
[20:18] even larger if someone knows
your serial address. >>Yeah for
addressing the commands, you
[20:23] need to have the full serial
number, not only the MAC
address, so you have to get the
[20:26] production date. And, while you
can try to brutefor- bruteforce
this, but it’s pretty hard, it’s
[20:32] a lot of entropy. So, the serial
number itself is more important
than the MAC address. >>Okay any
[20:40] more questions? Okay, not- not
really? Okay then, thank you.
Ah, oh wait wait wait. So, one
[20:50] question yes? >>[Inaudible] >>Ah
so the question is if they uh-
made a more secure g- uh- key
[21:01] generation method. So the thing
is, we think so but it is hard
to confirm, because they also
[21:08] fixed the secure boot issue. So
we can no longer extract the
firmware image and confirm if
[21:14] they do proper security. So, I
mean at least they promised us
to do this so, I think it is
[21:25] done. But- yeah. It’s always
good to like, double check.
>>Yeah in general they were
[21:30] pretty nice and once we managed
to reach them, actually because
this was quite a long process
[21:36] because uh- we tried to reach
them via the customer support
but it seemed like the customer
[21:41] support just dropped our
requests and they never reached
the developers. And just like
[21:45] one- like half a year later or
something, we get a message like
at 3am in the morning, US time,
[21:51] and it was like hey, we just saw
that you had some requests and
we found your plaintext proof of
[21:53] concept code uh- in our tracker
system so maybe we should talk.
And from then on they were super
[21:55] nice and everything went well.
>>Yeah and I thought like yeah,
maybe they are in the US and
[21:57] it’s 3am but maybe just call
them the same time the next day
um- and it really was 3am so the
[22:18] person was like not in another
time zone or something. >>Any
more questions? >>Okay cool.
[22:29] Thank you >>There’s another one
>>What what, another? Yeah I
didn’t see that. Where is the
[22:33] other question? Yeah?
>>[inaudible] >>So the question
was if there is a specific
[22:55] reason for why in Unix you are
able to read as a standard user
process of- the memory of other
[23:01] processes. >>So um- QNX back
until 6.6 I guess was strictly
projects compliant and I think
[23:09] this might have to do with it
because- cause, cause its
compliance means you really have
[23:14] to um- when you have file
permissions then you have to
really give this permission to
[23:20] any user who tries to read it.
Now, for QNX 7 and so on, the
Umask is the same but they also
[23:26] have some other uh-
authentication methods in place
like more fine granular not only
[23:31] the read bits is set and you can
read it, so this might be a
problem. And also these procfs
[23:37] file systems is used for some
inter-process communications and
stuff like that so I think they
[23:42] might have needed this for some
features but I’m not entirely
sure at this point. Okay. >>Yeah
[23:49] so. >>Thank you very much.
[Applause]
