Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-19502:

**Root Cause:**

*   **Heap buffer overflow:** The vulnerability lies within the `excluded_channels` function in `libfaad/syntax.c`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:**  A write operation attempts to write data beyond the allocated heap buffer. This is triggered during the processing of crafted MPEG AAC data within the `excluded_channels` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker providing a specially crafted MPEG AAC file, leading to a crash of the application due to the buffer overflow.
*  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Some of the advisories mention that this could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution. This is a common side effect of buffer overflows where an attacker can overwrite sensitive data structures and potentially divert control flow.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted MPEG AAC File:** The primary attack vector involves an attacker providing a specially crafted MPEG AAC file to a vulnerable FAAD2 application for processing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attack:**  The attacker can be remote as they only need to provide the crafted file as input to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information indicates that multiple vulnerabilities were found in FAAD2, including CVE-2018-19502. Other vulnerabilities include stack-based buffer overflows, global buffer overflows, out of bound reads and null pointer dereferences.
*   The provided information indicates that version 2.9.0 of FAAD2 is not affected by this issue
*   The issue has been fixed in Debian in version 2.7-8+deb8u3 for Debian 8 "Jessie" and 2.8.0~cvs20161113-1+deb9u2 for Debian 9 "Stretch".
