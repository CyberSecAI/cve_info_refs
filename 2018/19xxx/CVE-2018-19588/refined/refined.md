- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Alarm.com ADC-V522IR camera does not properly sanitize Vivotek's commands, allowing a user to reset the root password through the web administration interface during the wifi setup process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect access controls, specifically the lack of sanitization of commands, leading to a privilege escalation vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can reset the root password of the camera, gaining full access to the device. This allows the attacker to change preconfigured settings and download a backup of the `/etc/` directory, which contains Alarm.com configurations.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is HTTP, specifically through the web administration interface of the camera during the wifi setup process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the camera's wifi during the initial setup and send a crafted HTTP request.
