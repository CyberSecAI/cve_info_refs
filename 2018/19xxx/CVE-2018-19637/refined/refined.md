{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cveID": "CVE-2018-19637",
    "description": "Supportutils, before version 3.1-5.7.1, wrote data to static file /tmp/supp_log, allowing local attackers to overwrite files on systems without symlink protection",
    "affectedSoftware": [
      "supportutils"
    ],
    "rootCause": "The `supportutils` script writes to a static temporary file `/tmp/supp_log` without proper checks or protections.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure use of static temporary file",
      "Lack of symlink protection",
      "File overwrite vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on systems where symlink protection is not enabled by creating a symlink to a target file at `/tmp/supp_log`. This could lead to arbitrary code execution or other unauthorized access.",
    "attackVector": "Local",
    "requiredCapabilities": "Low privilege access to the system.",
    "additionalDetails": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by creating a symbolic link named `/tmp/supp_log` pointing to a file the attacker wants to overwrite and then triggering supportutils which will write output to the linked location."
