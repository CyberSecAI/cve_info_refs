### @soby-mathew **[soby-mathew](/soby-mathew)** commented [Dec 5, 2018](#issue-387696503)

Use the helper function `save_gp_registers` to save the register

state to cpu\_context on entry to EL3 in SMC handler. This has the

effect of saving x0 - x3 as well into the cpu\_context which was

not done previously but it unifies the register save sequence

in BL31.
