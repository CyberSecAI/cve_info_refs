The provided content describes a vulnerability in Metinfo version 6.1.3, which combines a reflected XSS and arbitrary response header setting to bypass Chrome's XSS filter.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

1.  **Reflected XSS:** The application reflects user-controlled input from the `lang_columnerr4` parameter in `/admin/column/move.php` without proper sanitization.
2.  **Arbitrary Response Headers:** The application allows setting arbitrary headers through the `serverurl` parameter in `/include/interface/applogin.php`, without validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

1.  **Reflected XSS (CWE-79):** User-supplied data is reflected in the HTML output without proper encoding, leading to script injection. Specifically, the `lang_columnerr4` parameter is directly echoed into the DOM.
2.  **Improper control of HTTP headers (CWE-113):** The `serverurl` parameter in `/include/interface/applogin.php` can be used to inject arbitrary HTTP response headers, allowing the attacker to set cookies containing malicious payloads.

**Impact of exploitation:**

1.  **Bypassing XSS Filter:**  By setting a malicious payload in a cookie using the arbitrary response header vulnerability, the attacker can bypass Chrome's XSS filter when the reflected XSS vulnerability is triggered.
2.  **Cookie theft:** The attacker can steal the administrator's cookies.
3.  **Arbitrary code execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the administrator's browser.

**Attack vectors:**

1.  **Step 1 (Header Injection):** The attacker crafts a URL to `/include/interface/applogin.php` with a `serverurl` parameter designed to set a cookie containing a malicious script, targeting an administrator's browser session.
2.  **Step 2 (XSS Trigger):** The attacker induces the administrator to visit the reflected XSS URL:  `/admin/column/move.php` which will cause the injection of javascript from the cookie set in step one to be executed in the context of the administrator's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

1.  The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs.
2.  The attacker needs to trick an administrator into visiting these crafted URLs.
3. The attacker does not need to have prior authentication
