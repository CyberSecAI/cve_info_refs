- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The functionality for promoting a milestone is missing an authorization check.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Privilege escalation vulnerability due to missing authorization check on milestone promotion.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A user with the "guest" role in a project can promote a project milestone to a group milestone. Once promoted, the milestone is available to all projects within the group and cannot be reversed.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted POST request to the `/sandeep01/test/milestones/4/promote` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a guest user in a project and have knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and the required request format.
