Debian Bug     : 950802 931478 950925 912294

It was found that Squid, a high-performance proxy caching server for
web clients, has been affected by multiple security vulnerabilities.
Due to incorrect input validation and URL request handling it was
possible to bypass access restrictions for restricted HTTP servers
and to cause a denial-of-service.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
3.5.23-5+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your squid3 packages.

For the detailed security status of squid3 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/squid3>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

Squid Proxy Cache Security Update Advisory SQUID-2018:5
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Advisory ID: SQUID-2018:5
Date: October 28, 2018
Summary: Denial of Service issue
in SNMP processing.
Affected versions: Squid 3.2.0.10 -> 3.5.28
Squid 4.x -> 4.3
Fixed in version: Squid 4.4
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2018\_5.txt
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-19132
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Problem Description:
Due to a memory leak in SNMP query rejection code, Squid is
vulnerable to a denial of service attack.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Severity:
This problem allows a remote attacker to consume all memory
available to the Squid process, causing it to crash.
In environments where per-process memory restrictions are not
enforced strictly, or configured to large values this may also
affect other processes operating on the same machine. Leading to
a much worse denial of service situation.
This problem is limited to Squid built with SNMP support and
receiving SNMP traffic.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Updated Packages:
This bug is fixed by Squid version 4.4.
In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable
releases can be found in our patch archives:
Squid 3.5:
http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/changesets/squid-3.5-bc9786119f058a76ddf0625424bc33d36460b9a2.patch
Squid 4:
http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v4/SQUID-2018\_5.patch
If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please refer
to the package vendor for availability information on updated
packages.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Determining if your version is vulnerable:
All Squid built with --disable-snmp are not vulnerable.
All Squid-2.x and older versions are not vulnerable.
All Squid-3.x up to and including 3.2.0.9 are not vulnerable.
All Squid-3.x up to and including 3.5.28 configured with
"snmp\_port 0" are not vulnerable.
All Squid-3.x up to and including 3.5.28 without snmp\_port
configured are not vulnerable.
All Squid-3.2.0.10 and later 3.2.x versions with snmp\_port
configured to a non-0 value are vulnerable.
All Squid-3.3 versions up to and including 3.3.14 with snmp\_port
configured to a non-0 value are vulnerable.
All Squid-3.4 versions up to and including 3.4.14 with snmp\_port
configured to a non-0 value are vulnerable.
All Squid-3.5 versions up to and including 3.5.28 with snmp\_port
configured to a non-0 value are vulnerable.
All Squid-4.x versions up to and including 4.3 with snmp\_port
configured to a non-0 value are vulnerable.
To determine the version of your Squid and its build options use
the command:
squid -v
To determine whether snmp\_port is configured use the command:
squid -k parse | grep snmp\_port
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Workarounds:
Either;
Enable firewall inspection of SNMP packets to enforce blocking
of any non-permitted packets prior to their arriving at Squid.
This restriction of packet sources reduces the risk, but does not
completely remove the vulnerability.
Or,
Remove snmp\_port and related configuration settings until Squid
can be upgraded to a fixed build.
This completely removes the vulnerability at cost of reduced
management and monitoring capabilities.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Contact details for the Squid project:
For installation / upgrade support on binary packaged versions
of Squid: Your first point of contact should be your binary
package vendor.
If your install and build Squid from the original Squid sources
then the squid-users@lists.squid-cache.org mailing list is your
primary support point. For subscription details see
.
For reporting of non-security bugs in the latest STABLE release
the squid bugzilla database should be used
.
For reporting of security sensitive bugs send an email to the
squid-bugs@lists.squid-cache.org mailing list. It's a closed
list (though anyone can post) and security related bug reports
are treated in confidence until the impact has been established.

# USN-4059-1: Squid vulnerabilities

15 July 2019

Several security issues were fixed in Squid.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 19.04](/security/notices?release=disco)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [squid](/security/cves?package=squid) - Web proxy cache server
* [squid3](/security/cves?package=squid3) - Web proxy cache server

## Details

It was discovered that Squid incorrectly handled certain SNMP packets. A

remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause memory consumption,

leading to a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. ([CVE-2018-19132](/security/CVE-2018-19132))

It was discovered that Squid incorrectly handled the cachemgr.cgi web

module. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to conduct

cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. ([CVE-2019-13345](/security/CVE-2019-13345))

Package        : squid3
Version        : 3.4.8-6+deb8u6
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-19132
Debian Bug     : 912294

It was discovered that there can be a denial of service (DoS)
vulnerability in squid3 due to a memory leak in SNMP query rejection
code when SNMP is enabled. In environments where per-process memory
restrictions are not enforced strictly, a remote attacker to consume
all memory available to the Squid process, causing it to crash.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
3.4.8-6+deb8u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your squid3 packages.

Thank you for finding and fixing this bug!

I have adjusted the PR title and description (i.e. the future [commit message)](https://github.com/measurement-factory/anubis#commit-message) to focus on the admin-important details. Please check that I did not misrepresent anything.

We probably should not put the other details into the commit message.
