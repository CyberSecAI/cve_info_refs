The provided content describes a vulnerability in a web application, likely "showdoc," where access control is not properly implemented. This allows users to read and modify notes created by other users.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Incorrect access control implementation. The application uses a page\_id to identify notes but does not properly verify if the user accessing the note is the owner.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The application allows users to access resources by manipulating the `page_id` parameter in the URL, without verifying ownership.
- **Insufficient Authorization:** The application does not properly check if the user has the correct permission to read or modify a specific note. The application may attempt to check permissions on the edit action, but this check can be bypassed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Unauthorized users can read notes created by other users. This may reveal sensitive or private information.
- **Data Modification:** Unauthorized users can modify notes created by other users, potentially altering or deleting critical information.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Direct URL manipulation:** An attacker can change the `page_id` in the URL to access other user's notes.
- **Bypassing client side checks:** An attacker can exploit the fact that even though the application throws a permissions error during the edit function it can still be bypassed and the note edited.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account on the vulnerable web application.
- The attacker needs to know or be able to guess the `page_id` of the note they want to access. This is trivial, as the id appears in the url.
- The attacker needs to access the edit functionality for a given page, even if there are initial UI indications that they do not have permission.
