The provided content details a privilege escalation vulnerability in GitLab related to guest user permissions on confidential issues.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control checks when handling requests to edit or delete comments. Specifically, even after an issue is made confidential, guest users retain the ability to modify or delete their own comments made before the issue was marked confidential. This occurs because the application fails to properly validate user permissions against the current confidentiality status of the issue when processing the requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Guest users are granted the ability to edit and delete their own comments in a confidential issue, which should not be allowed according to the access control policy.
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The application does not properly check the user's current permissions (in this case, a guest user) against the current confidentiality status of an issue when editing or deleting comments.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

A guest user can edit or delete their own comments on a confidential issue after the issue is made confidential by other users, which can potentially lead to:
*   **Information Disclosure:** Modifying comments on confidential issues might expose sensitive information to unauthorized users.
*   **Data Integrity Violation:** The ability to delete comments can lead to loss of essential information and potential manipulation of discussions.
*   **Circumvention of Confidentiality:** Guest users can bypass confidentiality controls intended to restrict access to issue content.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct API Requests:** The attacker crafts a direct PUT or DELETE request to the GitLab API, targeting a specific note (comment) on a confidential issue.
*   **Replaying requests:** The attacker uses a tool like Burp Suite to intercept, modify and replay previous successful requests for editing and deletion.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **GitLab Guest User:** The attacker must have a guest user account on the affected GitLab instance.
*   **Prior Comment:** The attacker must have previously created a comment on the issue before it was made confidential.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the GitLab server.
*   **Knowledge of Target:** The attacker must know the project name, issue number, and the note ID to be edited or deleted.
