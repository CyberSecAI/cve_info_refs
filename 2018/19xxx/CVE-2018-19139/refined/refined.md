**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-19139

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a memory leak in the `jas_malloc.c` file when the function `jpc_unk_getparms` in `jpc_cs.c` is called. Specifically, memory allocated by `jas_malloc` is not freed when the `--output-format jp2` option is used, leading to a leak.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak: The primary weakness is the failure to deallocate memory, causing a memory leak.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service: Repeated exploitation can lead to memory exhaustion, potentially causing a denial of service (DoS).

**Attack vectors:**
- By processing a malformed image file using the `--output-format jp2` option

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted image to be processed by the vulnerable software with the `--output-format jp2` option.
- No special privileges are required
