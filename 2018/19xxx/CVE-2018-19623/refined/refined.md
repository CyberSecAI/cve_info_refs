{
  "CVE-2018-19623": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The LBMPDM dissector in Wireshark did not properly handle negative values, leading to an out-of-bounds write.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds write, which can lead to a crash or arbitrary code execution",
    "Impact of exploitation": "The attacker could cause a crash of the application or write arbitrary data to memory locations outside of the allocated buffer, potentially leading to code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "By injecting a malformed LBMPDM packet onto the network, or by convincing a user to open a malformed capture file.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker would need to be able to inject a crafted packet into the network being monitored, or provide a malformed pcap file to the victim."
