  "CVE-2018-19665": {
    "description": "An integer overflow resulting in memory corruption issue was found in various Bluetooth functions. It could occur in routines wherein 'len' parameter is a 'signed int' which subsequently converts to an unsigned integer resulting in memcpy() copying large amounts of memory.",
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow when a signed integer is converted to an unsigned integer during memory copy operations in Bluetooth routines.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Memory Corruption"
    ],
    "impact": "A user inside the guest could exploit this flaw to crash the Qemu process, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "attack_vector": "A user inside a guest OS interacting with vulnerable Bluetooth functions.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "A user within a guest OS capable of sending crafted Bluetooth commands."
