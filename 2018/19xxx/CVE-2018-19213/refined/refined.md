The provided content is related to a bug report for NASM, specifically regarding memory leaks, but it does not correspond to CVE-2018-19213.

The bug report describes memory leaks identified in NASM version 2.14rc16, using AddressSanitizer (ASan) to detect the leaks. The ASan output indicates direct and indirect leaks occurring during the execution of the NASM assembler. The issue is described as a number of places where memory leaks occur and will be addressed when time permits.

The specific leaks are triggered by the provided test case "POC3," which is an assembly file. The ASan output identifies multiple leaks related to `malloc` calls within `nasm_malloc` in `nasmlib/malloc.c` and `nasm_new_addr`.

The report includes details on the allocation sizes and number of objects leaked. This is more detailed than a basic description of a memory leak.

Here's a breakdown:

- **Root Cause:** Memory leaks in `nasm_malloc` and `nasm_new_addr` within the NASM assembler.
- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Unfreed memory allocations.
- **Impact of Exploitation:** Memory consumption increase, potentially leading to denial-of-service if repeated.
- **Attack Vectors:** Compiling a specially crafted assembly file (`POC3`) that triggers the leaks.
- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Ability to execute NASM with the crafted assembly file.
