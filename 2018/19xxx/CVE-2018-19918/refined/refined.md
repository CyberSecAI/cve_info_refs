Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the ability to upload SVG files containing malicious JavaScript code. When these SVG files are directly accessed (not embedded via `<img>` tags), the browser executes the embedded JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is XSS. The application allows users to upload SVG files that can contain `<script>` tags with JavaScript.
*   **Inadequate input sanitization/validation:** The application doesn't properly sanitize or validate uploaded SVG files to prevent the inclusion of malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser when the user accesses the malicious SVG file. This could lead to various attacks, including:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites
    *   Data theft
    *   Other malicious actions within the user's browser context.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **File Upload:** The primary attack vector is the file upload functionality within the "table manager" section of CuppaCMS. An attacker uploads a specially crafted SVG file containing malicious JavaScript.
*   **Direct File Access:** After uploading the SVG, the attacker relies on the user accessing the uploaded file directly (e.g. by clicking on a link to the file).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to have an account with the ability to access the "table manager" section.
*   The attacker needs the ability to upload files.
*   The attacker needs the ability to entice another user to visit the uploaded file link.

**Additional Details:**

*   The report states that browsers normally ignore `<script>` tags within SVG files when they are embedded via `<img>` tags. However, they will execute scripts when the SVG file is accessed directly, which is the attack vector used here.
*   The provided proof of concept includes the steps to trigger the vulnerability and confirms the execution of the embedded JavaScript.
