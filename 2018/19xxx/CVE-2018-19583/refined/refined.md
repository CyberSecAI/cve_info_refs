- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Access tokens are logged in workhorse logs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Sensitive information (access tokens) are being written to logs, potentially exposing them to unauthorized parties.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with access to the workhorse logs could obtain valid access tokens and use them to impersonate users or gain unauthorized access to resources.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker would need access to the server's file system where workhorse logs are stored.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs access to the server's file system where the workhorse log files are stored.
