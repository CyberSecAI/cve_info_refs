Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-19071:

**CVE-2018-19071:** Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource: /mnt/mtd/boot.sh

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The `/mnt/mtd/boot.sh` script, which is executed during system startup, has world-writable permissions.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **CWE-732:** Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource. The script `/mnt/mtd/boot.sh` is world-writable, meaning any user (including unauthenticated attackers) can modify it.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can modify the `/mnt/mtd/boot.sh` script to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges at system startup. This leads to full device compromise, including the ability to install persistent malware, backdoor the device, and control it remotely.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Direct modification of `/mnt/mtd/boot.sh`: Any local user (or an attacker who has gained any level of access) can directly modify the script due to the world-writable permissions.
    *   Indirect modification through other vulnerabilities: An attacker who gains code execution through another vulnerability can modify `/mnt/mtd/boot.sh` to ensure persistence.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Low-level local access:**  An attacker needs to have write access to the file system of the device, which can be achieved through any of the other vulnerabilities listed, or through a compromised device/network
    *   **Persistence:** Once /mnt/mtd/boot.sh is modified, the changes will persist across reboots of the device.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided text gives more details than a standard CVE description.
*   The advisory indicates that this vulnerability is present on at least Foscam and Opticam i5 models.
* The vulnerability is due to insecure permission settings on a critical startup script, making it vulnerable to a wide range of attacks including persistent malware installation and device compromise
