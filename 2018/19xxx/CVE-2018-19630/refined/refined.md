The content relates to CVE-2018-19630.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `uhttpd` web server in OpenWrt does not properly encode the URL in the error message when a forbidden request is made, specifically in `cgi.c`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The server directly echoes part of the URL in the error response without sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could craft a malicious URL containing JavaScript, which, when accessed, would execute in the user's browser. This could allow the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the victim, steal cookies, or redirect the user to a malicious website.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP request to the server containing malicious JavaScript code in the URL, specifically within the path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not require any authentication and only needs the ability to send an HTTP request to the vulnerable server. The attacker can be located remotely from the server.
