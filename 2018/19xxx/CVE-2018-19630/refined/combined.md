## Description

[![@openwrt-bot](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99696057?u=a34f0600b60e14b77e8fdde0f52fc312ab9ed8f1&v=4&size=48)](/openwrt-bot)[openwrt-bot](https://github.com/openwrt-bot)opened [on Nov 28, 2018](https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/issues/6868#issue-1138713467)

*timk:*

Hi,

I discovered an unauthenticated reflected XSS issue in OpenWRT 18.06.1:

`$ curl -i '<http://router/cgi-bin/>?<script>cross_site_scripting.nasl</script>'

HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden

Connection: Keep-Alive

Transfer-Encoding: chunked

Keep-Alive: timeout=20

Content-Type: text/html`

`# Forbidden

You don't have permission to access /cgi-bin/?<script>cross_site_scripting.nasl</script> on this server.`

You can see that the path is not being encoded. Most browsers these days will probably properly encode it when sending the request, but it's still a good idea to fix it.

I can see where it needs to be encoded in cgi.c:

<https://git.openwrt.org/?p=project/uhttpd.git;a=blob;f=cgi.c#l73>

 `67 static void cgi_handle_request(struct client *cl, char *url, struct path_info *pi)

68 {

69 unsigned int mode = S_IFREG | S_IXOTH;

70

71 if (!pi->ip && !((pi->stat.st_mode & mode) == mode)) {

72 uh_client_error(cl, 403, "Forbidden",

73 "You don't have permission to access %s on this server.",

74 url);

75 return;

76 }`

There's another instance of the same error message which appears to be properly encoded using uh\_htmlescape() from utils.c, so you could probably just do the same:

<https://git.openwrt.org/?p=project/uhttpd.git;a=blob;f=file.c#l693>

 `690 escaped_url = uh_htmlescape(url);

691

692 uh_client_error(cl, 403, "Forbidden",

693 "You don't have permission to access %s on this server.",

694 escaped_url ? escaped_url : "the url");

695

696 if (escaped_url)

697 free(escaped_url);`

Cheers
