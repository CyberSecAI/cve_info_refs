- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application allows users to view the name of private groups by guessing the group ID and using it in the URL.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure direct object reference (IDOR) vulnerability, where a user can access private group names by manipulating the `group_id` parameter in a URL.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can enumerate all private group names from GitLab. This can potentially leak sensitive information about the organization's structure, ongoing projects, or collaborations.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes a guessed `group_id`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a user within the GitLab instance and needs to be able to guess group IDs.
