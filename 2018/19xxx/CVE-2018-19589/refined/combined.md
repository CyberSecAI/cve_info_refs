A few months ago, I started my first EU full-time job as a cyber security engineer. This job was at one of Bitcoin's leading mining pools - BTC.com in Amsterdam, Netherlands. BTC.com holds billions of euros in cryptographic assets (cryptocurrency). These assets are typically stored as private cryptographic keys, which in simpler terms can be likened to a list of secret magic words (yes like "open sesame") that unlock a cave full of actual cash.

So how do we keep these secret words from prying eyes? Bear in mind that one day, whenever the need arises, you will need to use this secret phrase (more technically known as a private key stored as a BIP39 mnemonic phrase) to obtain the actual money or at least make a transaction for a purchase like buying pizza on Takeaway.com. The risk of keeping private keys increases exponentially with the frequency of its use. Therefore, just like the Ali Baba cave, any time you mutter the words "open sesame", you draw closer and closer to the day when some passerby (hacker) finally overhears you.

## HOT WALLET / COLD WALLET PROJECT

For regular users, several techniques may be employed which range from using complex m-of-n hardware wallets, writing the secret on a sheet of paper and hiding in a safe, to simply converting the secret into a QR-code and tattooing it on a covered part of your body (keeping it truly private). Although these methods may reduce the risks to some extent, the underlying designs and / or protocols for unlocking cryptographic assets, using them, and locking them again may be subject to breaches from side channel attacks, highly intelligent malware, vulnerable software, or even accidentally getting your secret bitcoin paper eaten by your dog.

However, for large organisations like banks, credit card companies, and mining companies like BTC.com, more rigorous strategies need to be enforced. One typical high level strategy is to split all cryptographic assets into 2 (or more) parts based on the frequency of use. The less frequently used assets are kept out of reach of advanced technology - the goal here is to keep these keys away from any processor or block of code that is smart enough to be tricked into embedding a malicious program, therefore sadly, very few environments. Private keys saved like this are called cold storage schemes or wallets (any object that holds a private key). They can be likened to a savings account that is not frequently touched. The other part of the cryptographic assets which are more frequently used are also typically protected by a device called a Hardware Security Module (HSM). This is technically called a hot wallet, and can be likened to a current account.

I had just graduated out of a double master degree program in Cyber Security & Privacy, and a specialised degree in Advanced Cryptography and my first project was to develop a cold storage strategy and a design for operation of a hot wallet using an HSM provided by the renowned German HSM vendor Utimaco IS GmbH.

## WHAT IS AN HSM?

An HSM is a device that performs the following functions:

1. Stores sensitive data in a secure environment
2. Performs sensitive operations like encryptions, decryptions, digital signatures, and hashing at very fast rates in a secure environment,
3. Serves as a secure source of entropy (True Random Number Generation)
4. Deploys countermeasures against physical tampering, side channel attacks, and malicious software.

If we were to strip away all the fancy terms, we would immediately realise that most, if not all of us, actually use HSMs in our everyday lives. Most debit cards and credit cards are functional HSMs. Anytime you swipe a credit card at a supermarket, you are actually performing sensitive operations with sensitive private keys stored securely on your card. However, there are levels of security when it comes to HSMs. One of the most accredited standards is the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) standard, and I was privileged to work on the latest Utimaco PCIe CSe10 and Se-series Gen2 which, at the time of writing, are rated FIPS 140-2 level 3 and FIPS 140-2 level 2 respectively.

## THE ATTACK PROCESS

These devices truly gave me mixed feelings. On one hand, their speed of processing, secure environment, and True entropy made them any cryptographer's favourite toy. On the other hand, their insane defensive countermeasures against all manner of attacks made them any cryptanalyst's worst nightmare. For example, on the slightest suspicion of physical tampering, change in temperature or pressure, or any form of side-channel attack, the HSM's touchy feely sensors automatically trigger a panic alarm which immediately wipes the key RAM by flooding it multiple times with 0's and 1's.

Therefore, after designing my hot wallet HSM solution and validating it with my colleagues, I decided to test the solution by launching a series of penetrative tests (attacks) in order to compromise either the confidentiality, availability, or integrity of keys used. To my surprise, not a single attack yielded any success. All the standard cryptographic operations (like RSA, DSA, SHA, AES, etc) deployed left little or no attack surfaces. The Utimaco HSM was a complete monster. Yhupp, it was laughing at me. I could hear it in my sleep. "I will not let it win", I said to myself.

Next I began to attack the operational modes and how different users interact with keys protected by the HSM using all the supported APIs (Microsoft CSP/CNG/, JCE and PKCS#11). When I got to PKCS#11, a standard API called Cryptoki for communicating with tokens (how PKCS#11 calls an HSM), I discovered a fundamental contradiction between the original PKCS#11 documentation and the HSM library implementation. "Got you!!".

Utimaco HSMs provide 2 ways to store private keys: Internal storage and External storage. In internal storage mode, all keys in the HSM are encrypted with an internal master key *(IMK)* which never leaves the HSM. Back to the basics, this provides confidentiality (no unauthorised person can view the keys), integrity (keys cannot be tampered with), and availability (physical and side channel attacks to the HSM may cause a panic which wipes all keys on the device, however, there is still availability because the setup process strongly advises a backup).

If a user requires that an HSM stores more keys than its physical storage provisions, Utimaco provides the flexibility of securely storing keys on a device external to the HSM such as the server's storage device. These keys are of course encrypted as a blob with another key called the Master backup key *(MBK)* in the HSM. When it becomes necessary to perform operations with the keys in external storage, the HSM decrypts them on demand. It should be noted that in terms of availability, internal key storage is strictly more secure than the external key storage blob, however, both internal and external key storage have very high integrity and confidentiality guarantees.

## ATTACK DETAILS

It turns out that when keys are put in external storage, the PKCS#11 Security Officer (SO) is able to view properties of the cryptographic keys in selected slot. This directly contradicts section 4.4 of the PKCS#11 Cryptographic Interface Base Specification, which states that:

> “When the CKA\_PRIVATE attribute is CK\_TRUE, a user may not access the object until the user has been authenticated to the token.”

More precisely, it flies in the face of section 2.4 of the PKCS#11 User Guide which states that

> “This version of Cryptoki recognises two token user types. One type is a Security Officer (SO). The other type is the normal user. Only the normal user is allowed access to private objects on the token, and that access is granted only after the normal user has been authenticated.”

The segregation of responsibilities or separation of powers used in PKCS#11 enforces the security of keys by reducing the attack surface to only users, thus, providing accountability and traceability.

After finding this bug, the next question I asked myself, as would any rational adversary, was "How do I turn this technical glitch into a full-fledged economically beneficial attack?" More importantly, if someone hacked into my system, how could they benefit from this? Since the externally stored keys are in a hostile environment, I attempted to manipulate the key store in order to existentially forge a key pair that could hopefully be imported into the HSM by a regular USER and then be used as a Key Encryption Key (KEK) / Wrapping Key to extract all keys in external storage, including ones marked sensitive and non-extractable. This technique is known as *key conjuring.* I figured if I conjured some keys from thin air and combined it with the regular class of PKCS#11 attacks, it may yield something more economically beneficial.

Fortunately / Unfortunately, Utimaco gave no leg room to such attacks. The attack surfaces were tactfully closed. Thus, revealing the actual details of the stored keys or manipulating them were at best impossible, and at worst, a job for a future date. Despite the PKCS#11 vulnerability, all keys in external storage were still protected from attacks on Confidentiality and Integrity. That leaves the last friend in the triumvirate, Availability.

## ATTACK RESULTS

My final attempt was to create a regular PKCS#11 slot, create some key pairs, log in as the Security Officer, and find a way to delete all keys in external storage. "Bam!!! Got you again!". All the keys were deleted from the HSMs external storage. In that moment, it dawned on me: If there was a bank protecting credit card details with any Utimaco HSM or a cryptocurrency company protecting billions of euros worth of private keys in any Utimaco HSM, the dominant attack if applicable, would be as follows:

1. Attacker makes a copy of the encrypted external key storage blob since it's already in a hostile environment
2. Attacker runs a script to delete all the externally stored keys. At this point any keys not physically backed up will be lost to the victim organisation,

However, once the victim organisation provided some money (ransom), the encrypted external storage blob would be returned by the attacker. I thought to myself, "I will call this attack the reverse ransomware attack". This attack is especially efficient because it can be executed remotely for LAN type HSMs and even possible with PCIe type HSMs since Utimaco provides a way to administer such HSMs over SSH using a pin-pad daemon.

However, I always compared cryptography and cryptanalysis to *"dark magic"* from *Harry Potter*. You can wear a white hat, be Dumbledore and experiment with dark magic all you want, however, one must always exercise self-control to avoid putting on the black hat. It was at this point, that in the spirit of responsible disclosure, I sent a documentation of the attack to Utimaco, detailing the vulnerability, and recommending an immediate patch to be rolled out with the 2 images below as proof of breach.

The amazing Utimaco tech team responded immediately and worked tirelessly, keeping in touch at every turn, to determine the extent of the bug and created a patch in no time. In addition they provided our team at BTC.com with exam vouchers to get certified as CryptoServer HSM Engineers - an exam which I immediately took, passed, and was happy to add to my certifications. They also provided us with some free accessories for the company (BTC.com). Most importantly I received my first Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) ID from The MITRE Corporation. For cryptography and security enthusiasts, I have uploaded more technical details of this vulnerability to the CVE with ID [CVE-2018-19589](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-19589).

## CONCLUSION

In the light of the above, it is crystal clear that just using an HSM does not automatically guarantee the security of all cryptographic keys. With some HSMs, it is not immediately apparent that backup processes do not include external key storage, since they are already outside the HSM and are considered backed up. For example, in this particular attack, if the victim keeps regular backups of all keys even in external storage, even without a patch, they reduce the risk of loss considerably when attacked. We must not substitute good security practices (like Role-Based Access Control *(RBAC)*, fault tolerant designing, etc) for advanced technology.

More so, as a rule of thumb, you should deploy your defensive systems such that the cost of attack is at least equal to the value of the protected keys or assets. It is fundamental, but has to be said because no technology provides perfect security. Without controlling the attackers economic incentives, most security strategies are transient. There are always several avenues of attack to consider, especially, with the human factor that interacts with the device (Key Management). This is especially so when you have all your eggs in one basket (HSM).

Furthermore, many organisations also fall into the security by obscurity trap - e.g. "Utimaco does not support Multi-Sig wallets. If we develop a custom version and keep the design secret, the hackers will never understand how it works". This is a dangerous cat and mouse game, especially if the "soon to be victim" company starts developing their own crypto against the accepted standards. This kind of development ideology, a.k.a *crypto-voodoo,* usually never ends well. The solution is simple: If you want to keep your design a secret, at least build from standard building blocks. In the same vein, if you want to develop new crypto at least get second eyes. Ideally, one should do both.

Finally, if you are reading this article, and

* you are a member of a large company that is using a Utimaco HSM in external storage mode with the PKCS#11 R2 package,
* you have not patched for the latest vulnerability from December 2018,
* you have not made a physical copy of your external key storage

I would like extend my sincerest condolences to you. Patch quickly before the *Voldemorts*  of the Cyber security world get to you. Details on this CVE and how to patch it can be found [here](https://www.compumatica.eu/cms/data/uploads/media/CS_AF_CVE-2018-19589_P11_SO_Rights.pdf).

In a Pre-quantum cryptography era, in my opinion, Maybe and No. An HSM is merely a giant black box in an organizations data center, if due diligence is not performed in utilizing the administrative and technical controls of this effective appliance no matter where the storage location is of the sensitive material. The cryptography paradigm stipulates certain conditions and criteria to be fulfilled under which a cryptographic module can effectively deliver Trust.

Interesting article. But still I couldn't find out why this compliance bug with PKCS #11, considered as a security bug to take advantage of the user role by deleting its keys.
You're absolutely right about the authorized functionalities of the SO. It certainly should not be able to view, import, generate or delete the user objects, but still it can initialize the HSM and clear all the data including the user's private keys.

SecurityServer Advisory for CVE-2018-19589
PKCS#11 R2 Security Officer Rights

Utimaco has been made aware of a vulnerability affecting the PKCS#11 R2 provider shipped with our SecurityServer product package.

1

Issue

1.1  Description

When successfully authenticated as Security Officer (SO) to a PKCS#11 slot for which external key storage has been configured, this SO can
retrieve attributes of keys marked as private keys, and delete keys marked as private keys. The availability of external keys marked as private
may thus be compromised; the confidentiality and integrity of such keys is not compromised.

1.2

Issue ID

Internal issue ID HSM-5258. This issue has been filed in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list as CVE-2018-19589, see
https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=CVE-2018-19589

1.3  Detailed description

The PKCS#11 base specification1 (section 4.4) defines that “When the CKA_PRIVATE attribute is CK_TRUE, a user may not access the
object until the user has been authenticated to the token.” The PKCS#11 Usage Guide2 (section 2.4) states more precisely that “This version
of Cryptoki recognizes two token user types. One type is a Security Officer (SO). The other type is the normal user. Only the normal user is
allowed access to private objects on the token, and that access is granted only after the normal user has been authenticated.”.

Notice: In the sense of the PKCS#11 specification, the private part of an asymmetric key may have the CKA_PRIVATE attribute set to
CK_FALSE, and the public part of an asymmetric key may have the CKA_PRIVATE attribute set to CK_TRUE. The vulnerability described in
this advisory applies to the term “private” in the PKCS#11 sense, i.e. to keys which have their attribute CKA_PRIVATE set to CK_TRUE.

1 PKCS #11 Cryptographic Token Interface Base Specification Version 2.40 Plus Errata 01, 13 May 2016, OASIS
2 PKCS #11 Cryptographic Token Interface Usage Guide Version 2.40, 16 November 2014, OASIS

SecurityServer Advisory for CVE-2018-19589
PKCS#11 R2 Security Officer Rights

A Security Officer who has successfully authenticated to the CryptoServer HSM can a) see and retrieve attributes of keys in the external key
store which are marked as private keys, i.e. which have their CKA_PRIVATE attribute set to CK_TRUE, and b) delete such keys marked
private. An authenticated SO can thus accidentally or maliciously compromise the availability of keys marked private.

The SO is not able to see or retrieve the actual key value; modify the key value or any key attribute; use the key for any key usage it is
foreseen for, i.e. cannot sign, encrypt, derive other key material using this key; etc. The confidentiality and integrity of keys marked private is
thus not compromised.

The vulnerability only affects keys for which external key storage has been configured, i.e. where keys are stored as encrypted and integrity-
protected key blobs outside the HSM. Keys stored inside the HSM are not affected, i.e. an authenticated SO can neither see nor delete keys
marked as private when they are stored inside the HSM.

1.4  Affected Utimaco product(s), component(s) and version(s)
•  CryptoServer PKCS#11 R2 library ‘cs_pkcs11_R2’ for Windows and Linux, version 2.31 and above, shipped with SecurityServer

4.00.and above

•  Command-line administration tool ‘p11tool2’ for Windows and Linux, version 2.0.3 and above, shipped with SecurityServer 4.00 and

above

•  CryptoServer SDK customers may be affected when using the CryptoServer SDK to implement PKCS#11 Vendor Defined Mechanisms.
As mentioned before, the vulnerability affects the components above only when using external key storage. Affected components are not
vulnerable when using internal key storage, i.e. when storing PKCS#11 keys inside the HSM.

1.5  Not affected Utimaco product(s), component(s) and version(s)
•  SecurityServer components:

o  Graphical administration tool for the PKCS#11 provider ‘P11CAT’. Although P11CAT includes the vulnerable PKCS#11 library,

the way P11CAT uses the PKCS#11 library functions inhibits the exploit of this vulnerability.
o  Cryptographic provider other than the PKCS#11 provider, i.e. CSP/CNG provider, JCE provider.
o  Administration tools for cryptographic provider other than the PKCS#11 provider, i.e. ‘cxitool’, ‘cngtool’, ‘csptool’, ‘KeyCAT’.
o  HSM administration tools ‘csadm’, ‘CAT’.

•  SecurityServer’s former PKCS#11 R1 provider
•  CryptoServer CP5, TimestampServer, PaymentServer, CryptoScript SDK

SecurityServer Advisory for CVE-2018-19589
PKCS#11 R2 Security Officer Rights

2  What To Do

Please follow the instructions below if you are operating an affected component and use external key storage for storing your PKCS#11 keys.
In case you use internal key storage, you are not affected and thus don’t need to take any action.

Utimaco has released patch HSM-5258 for the CryptoServer PKCS#11 R2 implementation, which includes new versions of the following
components

•  PKCS#11library cs_pkcs11_R2.dll (Windows) resp. cs_pkcs11_R2.so (Linux)
•  Command line administration tool p11tool2, linked with the new PKCS#11 R2 library
•  Graphical administration tool P11CAT, linked with the new PKCS#11 R2 library

This patch is available in our support portal under Support -> Downloads -> SecurityServer Se Gen2 and Support -> Downloads ->
SecurityServer CSe. Login to the support portal is required.

Please notice: This patch requires minimum HSM firmware as per SecurityServer 4.01.0. In case you are running HSM firmware prior
SecurityServer 4.01.0, you should first download the SecurityServer 4.01.0 Product CD or a more recent Product CD from our support portal,
install this Product CD, and only then apply the patch as described in the next section. Please consult the SecurityServer 4.01.0 Release
Notes to retrieve the firmware module versions for SecurityServer 4.01.0, and check whether your operational firmware is equal or superior to
these versions.

When operating the CryptoServer PKCS#11 provider with external key store, you should retrieve patch HSM-5258.zip from our support
portal, extract the respective library and tools for your Operating System (Windows or Linux, 64 bit or 32 bit version) and overwrite the
vulnerable components in the installation directory.

Whether you are affected by this vulnerability or not, we recommend that you follow best practices for physical and logical access control, and
limit access to the PKCS#11 configuration file and the PKCS#11 external key storage to authorized persons and applications.

If you need more information or guidance, please contact our technical support as well.

Utimaco has been made aware of the so-called key extraction vulnerability [CVE-2015-5464](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5464). The vulnerability [CVE-2015-5464](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5464) is entirely based on functions and mechanisms specified in the PKCS#11 standard, in particular the `C_Derive` function with mechanism `CKM_EXTRACT_KEY_FROM_KEY`. Hence, all standard-compliant PKCS#11 implementations supporting these mechanisms are affected. Whether a given application is actually subject to this vulnerability depends on the specific environment and setting of key usage flags. We strongly encourage our customers to implement measures and follow guidelines as described in [Utimaco Company Statement concerning key extraction vulnerability](/documents/20182/39856/Utimaco%2BCompany%2BStatement%2Bconcerning%2Bkey%2Bextraction%2Bvulnerability.pdf/8efa1ea9-4e6d-4202-b294-323ba259fbe7).

The imminent insertion of a leap second on June 30, 2015 has raised concerns about availability and reliability of computer systems. Utimaco has conducted an analysis of possible impacts of this leap second on our products. This analysis has led to the conclusion that handling of the leap second by CryptoServer HSMs and CryptoServer LAN appliances ensures valid system time settings. Neither degradation of service nor operational failure nor any security-relevant issues are to be expected.

Utimaco has become aware of vulnerability [CVE-2015-0235](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0235) aka "GHOST" affecting “gethostbyname” functions of Linux library glibc. Analysis of the impact of GHOST on Utimaco HSM products has led to the following conclusions:

* Utimaco’s “CryptoServer LAN” appliances embed a vulnerable version of glibc. The GHOST vulnerability cannot be exploited due to the intentionally limited functionality of the CryptoServer LAN hardened Operating System and further mitigating factors.
* Furthermore, some tools and libraries delivered with Utimaco’s HSM product packages call the affected gethostbyname() function. These software modules load glibc dynamically at runtime. Although keys stored inside the HSM cannot be retrieved by an attacker, he might gain access to other data if the host computer relies on an affected version of glibc. We therefore strongly recommend upgrading host systems to glibc version 2.18 or above.
