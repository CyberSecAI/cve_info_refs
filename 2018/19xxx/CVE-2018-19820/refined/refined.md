  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in the construction of a web page, resulting in reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could inject arbitrary JavaScript code that could be executed in the context of a user's browser session, potentially leading to information theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious URL containing the JavaScript payload in the `ConnPoolName` parameter and tricking a user to click the link.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into clicking it. They do not need to have prior access to the system."
