Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-19300:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the presence of an exposed URI, `/EXCU_SHELL`, which directly pipes user input to the system's `/bin/bash` shell. This functionality, seemingly intended for retrieving hardware and firmware information, lacks proper input sanitization or access control mechanisms, allowing arbitrary command execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated Remote Command Execution:** The `/EXCU_SHELL` URI can be accessed without any authentication, enabling remote attackers to execute shell commands.
*   **Direct Shell Access:** The vulnerability allows direct interaction with the system's shell, providing attackers with the ability to execute a wide range of commands.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `command1` parameter within the HTTP request isn't sanitized or validated, enabling injection of malicious commands.
*   **Lack of Access Control:** There is no mechanism in place to prevent unauthorized access to the `/EXCU_SHELL` URI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Administrative Privileges:** Attackers can execute commands with full administrative (root) privileges, leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can use the vulnerability to access sensitive data, including system files, credentials, and other confidential information. The example provided demonstrates reading `/etc/passwd`.
*   **System Modification:** Attackers can modify system configurations, install malware, or create backdoors.
*   **Device Control:** Attackers can gain control over the router, using it for malicious purposes like botnet participation or denial-of-service attacks.
*   **Ransomware Attacks**: As stated by one of the blog entries, actively exploited RCE vulnerabilities are being used in ransomware attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending an HTTP GET request to the `/EXCU_SHELL` URI.
*   **Custom Headers:** The request must include specific headers: `cmdnum`, `command1` and `confirm1`.
*   **Command Injection:** The `command1` header carries the shell command to be executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Accessibility:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device's IP address and port.
*   **No Authentication:** No prior authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a basic HTTP request.
*   **Shell Command Knowledge:** Knowledge of basic bash commands to execute on the target system.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered in D-Link DWR and DAP routers.
*   Affected models include DAP-1530, DAP-1610, DWR-111, DWR-116, DWR-512, DWR-711, DWR-712, and DWR-921.
*   The issue has been assigned CVE-2018-19300.
*   D-Link has released firmware updates for some of the affected devices.
*   The vulnerability was disclosed by Greenbone after D-Link did not provide a fix within 90 days.
