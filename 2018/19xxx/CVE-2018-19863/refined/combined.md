# CVE-2018-19863 for specific beta versions of 1Password for Mac

Published: December 14, 2018
## About the issue

An issue was discovered in 1Password for Mac 7.2.3.BETA-0 through 7.2.3.BETA-2. A mistake in error logging resulted in instances where sensitive data passed from Safari to 1Password could be logged locally on the user’s machine. That data could include usernames and passwords which a user entered into Safari.

The bug was discovered internally on December 3, 2018, and 7.2.3.BETA-3 was released the same day which removed the erroneous logging statement. Version 7.2.3.BETA-4 was released later that day, and included code which removed the log files themselves. We delayed public notification until sufficient time had passed for 1Password beta users to install 7.2.3.BETA-4, which removes the logs.

This issue is listed under the Common Vulnerability Enumeration (CVE) [CVE-2018-19863](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-19863).

## Who may be affected

The incorrect logging was only present in 1Password for Mac beta versions 7.2.3.BETA-0, 7.2.3.BETA-1, and 7.2.3.BETA-2. 7.2.3.BETA-0 was released on November 2, 2018. A fixed version was released on December 3, 2018.

The incorrect error logging was in a component that was handling communication from the Safari web browser. Information travelling from 1Password to Safari was not affected. The logging was triggered by various error conditions, so only a portion of messages from Safari to 1Password were written to logs.

To be among those potentially affected, all the following conditions must apply:

* Use one of the affected beta versions of 1Password for Mac: 7.2.3.BETA-0, 7.2.3.BETA-1, or 7.2.3.BETA-2.
* And use 1Password in Safari.
* And have entered information directly into login forms in Safari instead of using 1Password to fill the information.

## Impact and exploitability

Affected users may have had some information which they entered into Safari written to disk in these logs. That data may include username and passwords that were being transmitted from Safari to 1Password. Information filled by 1Password would not have been included in the logs. A malicious actor or process with full (non-sandboxed) user read access to the user’s disk would have been able to read the log files and extract logged secrets.

## Recommended actions

Those using affected beta versions of 1Password for Mac should update to 1Password 7.2.3.BETA-4 or later, which will remove any logs that may contain user secrets.

Those who want to verify that no secrets remain in log files may inspect the content of any files in the folder:

```
~/Library/Containers/com.agilebits.onepassword7.1PasswordSafariAppExtension/Data/Library/Logs/1Password

```

These log files are not typically included in most backups.

## Commentary

First of all, we apologize for this bug. It is not the kind of bug that should appear in a product that people rely on to protect their privacy and security. There are numerous stages at which we should have prevented this bug from ever getting as far as it did.

We understand that the 1Password apps handle user secrets, and we understand that any logging action â even if only local to the user’s machine â could potentially write user secrets to disk. Built on that awareness, we have procedures and policies in place to prevent such inappropriate logging. Those procedures and policies failed in this case. We are therefore investigating additional procedures and policies as well as mechanisms that would more effectively enforce policies.

You can secure a team of up to 10 for a flat monthly price with 1Password [Team Starter Pack](https://1password.com/product/teams-small-business-password-manager), making it the best value for small teams. For larger organizations, 1Password Business combines comprehensive protection with granular controls. Integrate with your identity provider, create audit trails with usage reports, and create, manage, and enforce administrative and security policies at scale.

### 7.9  (build [#70900001](#v70900001 "7.9 - build #70900001")) – released 2021-10-12 – [download](https://c.1password.com/dist/1P/mac7/1Password-7.9.pkg)

You can now securely share virtually any 1Password item with anyone – even if they don't use 1Password!

To get started, open the share menu and select "Share" to generate a link, specify who you want to share the item with and for how long, then send out the link however you wish. It's as simple as copy and paste, without the security risks that come from pasting sensitive info directly into chat and email.

Use it to send logins to an external contractor, share the Wi-Fi password with your visiting in-laws, or pass a Secure Note to your partner.

Happy sharing!

### 7.7  (build [#70700015](#v70700015 "7.7 - build #70700015")) – released 2020-11-16 – [download](https://c.1password.com/dist/1P/mac7/1Password-7.7.pkg)

Today we’re delighted to bring a BIG update to 1Password on your Mac. The first thing you may notice is the brand-new icon! It is tailored to be right at home in your Dock on macOS Big Sur, while also being cozy on previous versions of macOS. The vault doors have also been refreshed for a subtle, more modern look. And the item detail view has a thoughtfully considered new design.

That’s not all — we have three big features to improve the way you use 1Password every day.

## New Safari Experience

1Password has a whole new experience in Safari — it will intelligently offer logins, credit cards, and identities right on the webpage. Furthermore, 1Password now deftly fills multi-page login forms and one-time codes. Using 1Password in Safari has never been better.

## Virtual Payment Cards from Privacy

For our US-based customers, we now offer integration with Privacy in Safari. Our friends at Privacy protect online payments similar to how 1Password protects your passwords. Instead of entering your real credit card information, Privacy creates a unique virtual payment card for each service.

When you create a Privacy card using 1Password in Safari, 1Password will offer to save that virtual card so it’s ready the next time you need it.

## Unlock with Apple Watch

Today’s 1Password update expands the convenience of unlocking your information while maintaining security. You can now unlock 1Password from your Apple Watch on any Mac laptop with Touch ID, and many newer models of Mac mini, iMac, and Mac Pro.

The best part is Unlock with Apple Watch works in concert with Touch ID, meaning you will get a prompt for both, and using either will unlock 1Password.

We are so excited to get all these fantastic new features into your hands! We hope you will enjoy using them as much we enjoyed making them for you.

While we never prompt you for a review within 1Password itself, seeing your 1Password review on [GetApp](https://www.getapp.com/security-software/a/1password/) would be really cool.

If you need us you can find us at [@1Password on Twitter](https://twitter.com/1Password). If you have questions or need support just pop on over to [support.1password.com](https://support.1password.com/) and we'll point you in the right direction.

### 7.3.1  (build [#70301008](#v70301008 "7.3.1 - build #70301008 (146)")) – released 2019-06-26 – [download](https://c.1password.com/dist/1P/mac7/1Password-7.3.1.pkg)

Hello again, friends! Today’s update might be going out under a “bug fix” release number but don’t let that fool you; we’ve packed in some wonderful improvements after listening to your feedback on our 7.3 release a few weeks back. In particular we’ve added some new preferences for 1Password mini (accessible from the menu bar, 1Password 7 > Preferences > Mini), brought tags back to 1Password mini, and reintroduced the ability to fill generated passwords.

When you install this update you may notice the connection between 1Password and your web browser become unstable. This is a problem we’ve fixed for *future* updates, but for today your best bet to get things back in working order is to restart your computer. We are terribly sorry for the inconvenience.

### 7.3  (build [#70300020](#v70300020 "7.3 - build #70300020 (146)")) – released 2019-05-28 – [download](https://c.1password.com/dist/1P/mac7/1Password-7.3.pkg)

Strap in, friends, today’s update is a big one. For the last several months our design and development team has been diligently laboring over every last detail of 1Password mini. Today we are so excited to show off this brand new way to use 1Password within your browser and apps.

### TL;DR

* 1Password mini has been redesigned to make it easier than ever to get your information out of 1Password.
* Our all new "filling brain" analyzes web pages when you bring up 1Password mini and only shows you the items you can fill on that page.
* Dragging and dropping your login information into supported third party apps has never been easier.
* You can now select your accounts in the vault picker to see all the vaults in that account.

### Intelligently simplified

When we began working on 1Password mini, there were three things we knew it needed to do really well:

* Show items that match the frontmost app or website.
* Fill your passwords, credit cards, and address information into a web page.
* Generate new passwords quickly and easily.

Each of these tasks was boiled down to its simplest form and then built back up to only include what was absolutely required to quickly, clearly, and efficiently pull it off. A big piece of what makes 1Password mini successful when it comes to filling your information is our "filling brain". Powered by machine learning, 1Password analyzes the web page and suggests the items you're most likely to need on that page - all without your information leaving your computer. What this means is that when you're on a shopping cart page buying that brand new bespoke artisanal handmade coffee cup cozy, 1Password mini will have your credit card ready and waiting for you.

### Drag, drop, and roll

In 1Password 7, we gave 1Password mini the ability to recognize certain apps on your system. Whether you are logging into your Adobe account within Photoshop, signing into Discord, or accessing Evernote 1Password will recognize when you're using these apps and offer up their related login information. The number of apps supported by 1Password has grown and with this update we've made it even easier to get your secure information into them. Simply bring up 1Password when faced with a login page in one of your apps to drag and drop your username and password. Once you start dragging 1Password mini smoothly fades out of the way and comes right back after you drop. It is one of the fastest, most secure, and fun ways to get your passwords where you need them.

### Search and ye shall find

While 1Password mini probably sees the most use in your browser, it is also the fastest way to get to any of your items. At any point while using 1Password mini, you can simply start typing a search term and 1Password will scan your item titles, usernames, website addresses, and tags to find exactly what you're looking for. On the phone paying a bill? Just type in the name of your credit card and it will show up. Filling out a customs form at the end of an international flight? Search for your passport to jump right to it. How about when you need your child's social security number when you're on the phone with their doctor? 1Password is great for storing all types of information, and with 1Password mini it's all just a few keystrokes away.

### Mountains more

1Password 7.3 contains over 150(!) improvements and bug fixes. Many of these improvements are the direct result of your feedback, dear customer. Thank you for all your input and for helping us make 1Password the best it can be.

While we never prompt you for a review within 1Password itself, seeing your 1Password review on [GetApp](https://www.getapp.com/security-software/a/1password/) would be really cool.

If you need us you can find us at [@1Password on Twitter](https://twitter.com/1Password). If you have questions or need support just pop on over to [support.1password.com](https://support.1password.com) and we'll point you in the right direction.

### 7.2  (build [#70200011](#v70200011 "7.2 - build #70200011 (126)")) – released 2018-09-24 – [download](https://c.1password.com/dist/1P/mac7/1Password-7.2.pkg)

Happy macOS Mojave Day, everyone! We are incredibly excited about today’s update for a number of reasons, not the least of which are Dark Mode and our brand new Safari App Extension. Let’s dive in!

### TL;DR

* 1Password has embraced its inner darkness and looks *gorgeous* on macOS Mojave in Dark Mode.
* Using 1Password in Safari has never been easier than with our brand new Safari App Extension, built right in.
* Advanced security with full support for the new hardened runtime and app notarization.

### Everything’s better in the dark

macOS Mojave includes a gorgeous way to use your Mac with a new feature called Dark Mode. After enabling it in the General pane of System Preferences, you are ushered into a whole new world. Ever since this feature was announced in June, we’ve been working hard to make sure every pixel of 1Password is perfectly at home in the dark.
### Let’s go on a Safari

Starting today 1Password has built-in support for the Safari web browser, meaning you’ll never again have to install a separate browser extension to fill your passwords, credit cards, and personal information while browsing the web.

### More secure than ever before

Starting with macOS Mojave, a whole new set of security protections became available and we’re happy to say that 1Password has opted into *all of them*. 1Password now executes within a hardened runtime, meaning it’s protected against modification by other processes on your computer. It has also been notarized by Apple’s new notary service, which means it has been verified as being free of malware and other runtime vulnerabilities. All of this adds up to create a better, safer 1Password experience.

*This update requires Safari 12 or later. You can install the latest version of Safari via the App Store. You find more information about updating Safari [on Apple.com.](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204416)*

* Support for the Safari web browser is now built in to 1Password, meaning you’ll never have to install a separate extension again.
* 1Password now runs within a hardened runtime, keeping it safe from potentially malicious processes on your system. {#1722}
* 1Password is notarized using Apple's notary service, meaning its been verified as being free of malware.
* Categories and templates are now localized for 1Password.com customers. {#2096}

* All note fields now support Markdown. {#1771}
* OmniOutliner 5 has been added to the list of applications for which 1Password mini will show suggested items. {#1886}

### 7.0.2  (build [#70002000](#v70002000 "7.0.2 - build #70002000 (27)")) – released 2018-05-29 – [download](https://c.1password.com/dist/1P/mac7/1Password-7.0.2.pkg)

Good day, folks! After keeping an eye on your feedback for the last few days we discovered something: many of you have more than one Mac! This update allows you to skip over the "welcome" window and sign into the 1Password account you created elsewhere. Similarly, if you purchased a standalone license on a different Mac, you can double click the license file to apply it and be taken right to the lock screen.

Keep that feedback coming, we really appreciate it!

1Password never prompts you for a review because we value your workflow too much to interrupt it. If you feel generous or have a couple of minutes, pop on over to [GetApp](https://www.getapp.com/security-software/a/1password/) and leave us some feedback. It makes a huge difference to us. Thank you in advance.

### 7.0  (build [#70000019](#v70000019 "7.0 - build #70000019 (27)")) – released 2018-05-22 – [download](https://c.1password.com/dist/1P/mac7/1Password-7.0.pkg)

Welcome to 1Password 7.0 for Mac, the greatest version of 1Password we’ve ever created. We’ve packed nearly forty new features, 50 improvements, and countless bug fixes into this release and we’re so excited to share it with you.

There’s a lot of ground to cover, so let’s dig in, shall we?

### Watchtower with superpowers

Watchtower is all grown up! In addition to checking for compromised websites and finding weak and reused passwords, we’ve expanded the abilities of Watchtower to keep you even safer online. By securely checking your passwords against the database at haveibeenpwned.com, 1Password can tell you if they’ve been compromised in a data breach (and all this is done without your passwords ever leaving your computer). Watchtower can also identify any Login items that support two-factor authentication and guide you through enabling it for those websites. And, because sometimes it’s the little things, Watchtower will now keep an eye on expiring items so you know in advance if you need to renew your credit cards, passports, licenses, and more.

### Not just for browsers anymore

1Password has always helped you effortlessly sign in to your favorite websites. Now it helps you sign in to your favorite apps, too, by showing you suggested Logins for the app you’re currently using. Signing in to the App Store? Click the 1Password icon in your menu bar to see your Apple ID. Simply drag & drop your username and password, and you’re in. We’ve baked in support for a huge list of apps, but if you find one that doesn’t work as you’d expect, please get in touch.

### Your Vaults, Upgraded

For 1Password 7, we gave ourselves a challenge: make vaults wonderful. After much design and iteration, we’re thrilled to show you a whole new way to use and manage your vaults. The journey begins by clicking on the vault indicator at the top left of 1Password. Click on a vault to open it (or double-click to quickly switch to it). Vaults are fully drag & drop-enabled, making it super simple to move or copy items from one vault to another. You can also create vaults with ease and personalize them using a beautiful set of built-in custom icons. Explore the family or team sharing options available to you by clicking on the ••• indicator next to each vault. You can create a vault for your kids to give them access to things like garage door codes or Wi-Fi information. Create a vault in your team or business account to share documents securely with your coworkers. We think this will change the way you use 1Password.

### So Much More

As we mentioned above, 1Password 7 is an update chock full of new goodness. We could easily write a 30,000 word missive on everything that’s gone into this release. Instead, we’re going to close out with a quick list of its greatest hits.

* Every pixel has been put under the microscope and polished for maximum upgradedness.
* The new “pop-out” feature allows you to view an item in a window of its own and keep it handy.
* Secure notes are now rendered using Markdown.
* Quick Open allows you to quickly jump to your items or vaults (find it under the File menu).
* A custom password font, all our own, courtesy of Alan Dague-Greene.
* A new password strength meter.
* Touch ID now leverages your computer’s Secure Enclave, making it more secure than ever before.
* Login items now have a gorgeous, custom rendered icon by default.
* Remove duplicate items on a per-vault basis by clicking Help > Tools > Clean Up Duplicate Items.
* Integration with Spotlight allows you to find your items using Apple’s built-in search engine.
* Nested tags allow you to up your organization: add tags with / in them and 1Password will break them down into groups.
* Opt in to automatic updates and never be left behind again.

1Password 7 has truly been a labor of love. We’ve been working on this update for a long time and have poured a lot of ourselves into it. We are incredibly proud of this release and hope that you love it as much as we do.

We enjoy hearing from you! If you have questions or need support, just pop on over to [support.1password.com](https://support.1password.com) and we'll point you in the right direction.
