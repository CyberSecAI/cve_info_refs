Description:\n# In Rockwell Automation Allen-Bradley PowerMonitor 1000 web page, there are a few buttons are disabled,\n# such as “Edit”, “Remove”, “AddNew”, “Change Policy Holder” and “Security Configuration”.\n# View the source code of login page, those buttons/functions just use the “disabled” parameter to control the access right.\n# It is allow attackers using proxy to erase the “disabled” parameter, and enable those buttons/functions.\n# Once those buttons/functions are enabled.\n# Attackers is capable to add a new user who have administrator right.\n",

        "root_cause": "The web interface of Rockwell Automation Allen-Bradley PowerMonitor 1000 uses the 'disabled' parameter in the HTML source code to control access to administrative functions. This allows for manipulation of the parameter.",
