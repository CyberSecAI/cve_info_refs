The provided content contains detailed information about multiple vulnerabilities in Foscam IP cameras, including one with the identifier CVE-2018-19067.

**CVE-2018-19067 Specifics:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Hard-coded credentials. The cameras have a hidden, hard-coded username (`factory~`) and password (`Ak47@99`).
*  **Weakness:** Use of hard-coded credentials (CWE-798)
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can use these credentials to access some of the device's web interface functionalities. Specific functionalities vary by model, but can include the ability to control the telnetd service and restore the device to factory settings.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network-based. An attacker would send an HTTP request with the hard-coded credentials.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must be able to send network requests to the device.
