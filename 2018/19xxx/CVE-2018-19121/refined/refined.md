  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability occurs in the Ethernet_receivePacket function within ethernet_bsd.c. The issue stems from a read memory access at an address that points to the zero page. This happens when an interface is selected that is not available, which leads to a null pointer dereference or access to an invalid memory location.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Null pointer dereference",
      "Access to invalid memory location",
	  "Insufficient error handling"
    ],
    "impact": "The impact is a segmentation fault (SEGV), leading to the program's termination. This can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) if the application is critical.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attack vector involves attempting to use the library with an invalid network interface. This can occur either through a misconfiguration or deliberately by an attacker.",
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "The attacker must be able to execute code that uses the libiec61850 library.",
	  "The attacker needs to provide an unavailable interface."
