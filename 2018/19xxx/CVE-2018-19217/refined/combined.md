RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

Can you please report it on the upstream mailing list?   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1643753#c3)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2018-11-27 06:29:41 UTC  ``` (In reply to Miroslav Lichvar from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1643753#c2)) > In RHEL7 there is no ncurses-6.1. Can you please report it on the upstream > mailing list?  And mention clearly how to reproduce this, instead of sending a termcap file?   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1643753#c4)  Miroslav Lichvar    2018-11-28 15:00:10 UTC  ``` The [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=1643753#c0) suggests it should be an input of the captoinfo utility. But it doesn't seem to crash for me with the current ncurses-6.1 code (nor the other POC file from the [bug #1643754](show_bug.cgi?id=1643754 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - There is a Segmentation fault on unknown address in function _nc_parse_entry in libncurses.")).  It would be good to at least know which ncurses-6.1 version exactly crashed.  I'm CCing the upstream maintainer if he could make any sense of this.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1643753#c5)  Thomas E. Dickey    2018-11-28 21:45:53 UTC  ``` It doesn't crash with current ncurses, and as noted is not relevant to RHEL7. In a quick check, it doesn't crash with ncurses 6.1 release, either.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1643753#c6)  Sylvain Beucler    2019-04-23 09:36:17 UTC  ``` FYI this was fixed back in 6.0.20170701 <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-ncurses/2019-04/msg00020.html> <https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/NEWS.html#t20170701>   ``` |  |
