- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `XssHttpServletRequestWrapper` filter in JEESNS V1.3 is too lax, allowing malicious script content to pass through without proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to inadequate input validation and filtering. The filter fails to prevent the storage of malicious scripts in the database.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into posts and comments which, when viewed by other users, will execute in their browser. This could lead to various attacks, including:
    - Cookie theft, if HTTP Only cookies are not set
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the web page
    - Redirection to malicious websites
    - Unauthorized actions on behalf of the user
- **Attack vectors:**
    - By posting a malicious javascript in a post
    - By posting a malicious javascript in a post's comment
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Attacker must be a logged-in user capable of posting or commenting
    - No special privileges required
    - The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious JavaScript code through input fields.
