The provided content describes two vulnerabilities in yunucms V1.1.5: Arbitrary File Deletion and Remote Code Execution via a new installation process.

**1. Arbitrary File Deletion:**

*   **Root cause:** The `remove()` function in `/statics/ueditor/php/vendor/Local.class.php` uses the user-supplied `$_POST['key']` value directly in an `unlink()` call without proper sanitization or authentication.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Uncontrolled data used in a file operation. Lack of input validation/sanitization.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can delete arbitrary files on the server.
*   **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted POST request to `/statics/ueditor/php/controller.php?action=remove` with the `key` parameter set to the path of the file to be deleted.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Remote access to the application.

**2. Remote Code Execution (via new installation process):**

*   **Root cause:** After exploiting the arbitrary file deletion to remove `install.lock`, an attacker can re-initiate the installation process. During the database configuration step, the application uses user-provided input for the database prefix (`DB_PREFIX`) in a way that allows code injection. This input is later written to the `database.php` configuration file using `file_put_contents()`.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Code injection via configuration file manipulation, lack of input validation and sanitization during the installation process, usage of `file_put_contents()` to write configuration.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server by injecting malicious PHP code into the `database.php` configuration file which will be executed upon visiting the homepage.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    1.  Exploit the arbitrary file deletion vulnerability to remove `install.lock`.
    2.  Trigger the installation process.
    3.  During setup step 2, inject malicious PHP code into the `DB_PREFIX` field, such as  `yunu_',].die(file_put_contents('uploads\image\f4ck.php','<?=phpinfo();?>'));$a=['a'=>'`.
    4.  Complete the installation process.
    5.  Visit the homepage to trigger the execution of the injected PHP code, which in the PoC creates a file `uploads/image/f4ck.php` containing `<?php phpinfo(); ?>`.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Remote access to the application and the ability to interact with the installation process.
