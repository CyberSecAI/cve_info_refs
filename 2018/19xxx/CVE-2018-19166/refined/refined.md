Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability #1: "I Can't Believe it's not Stake"**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient validation of coinstake transactions in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) implementations, particularly in those adopting Bitcoin's "headers first" feature.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **No coinstake validation before storing headers:** Some cryptocurrencies fail to check the coinstake transaction when receiving block headers, leading to the acceptance of invalid headers.
    *   **No coinstake validation before storing blocks:** When receiving blocks, the coinstake transaction isn't validated before committing the block to disk, especially when the block is on a fork.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **RAM exhaustion:** Attackers can send a large number of invalid block headers, filling up the victim node's RAM, leading to a crash.
    *   **Disk exhaustion:** Attackers can send a large number of invalid blocks, filling up the victim's disk, requiring manual intervention to clean up.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Network-based attacks where the attacker sends malformed headers and/or blocks to the victim node.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   No stake required. Attackers can perform these attacks even without owning any coins in the targeted cryptocurrency.
    *   Ability to establish network connections to the victim node.

**Vulnerability #2: "Spent Stake Attack"**

*   **Root Cause:** Incomplete validation of coinstake transactions, where the checks only verify the existence of the coin but not if it's unspent. Also, validation is against the main chain, not the fork.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Validation against spent outputs:** The preliminary check verifies if a coin exists in the transaction database (TxDB) but doesn't check if it's already spent.
    *   **Stake amplification:** Attackers can create multiple transactions that spend a single coin back to themselves. This creates "apparent stake", allowing the attacker to mine blocks with much higher probability than their actual stake.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Resource exhaustion (Disk):** By amplifying their stake, attackers can mine PoS blocks at a past time and fill the victimâ€™s disk with invalid blocks.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Network-based attacks where the attacker sends malformed blocks with amplified stake to victim nodes.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Small amount of stake required.
    *   Ability to create and broadcast transactions to amplify their stake.

**Key points:**

*   Both vulnerabilities stem from the inadequate validation of PoS blocks compared to PoW blocks.
*   The "headers first" optimization inherited from Bitcoin inadvertently introduced vulnerabilities when applied to PoS.
*   The attacks are relatively easy to execute but are difficult to mitigate completely.
*   The attacks were found to affect 26+ Proof-of-Stake cryptocurrencies, with varying impact and mitigation strategies across different teams.
