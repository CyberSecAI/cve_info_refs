{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before reflecting it back in the web page.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser session, allowing them to perform actions such as session hijacking, defacing the website, redirecting the user to malicious sites, or stealing sensitive information.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious URL with the XSS payload in the `ConnPoolName` parameter, which is then reflected in the response. The attacker then tricks a victim into clicking this link.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to craft a malicious URL and lure the victim into visiting it. The attacker does not require any special privileges or access to the server."
