**CVE-2018-19552 - Arbitrary File Upload**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The "create survey" function in Interspire Email Marketer allows for arbitrary file uploads when the "allow all file type" option is enabled.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unrestricted file upload, lack of proper file type validation.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can upload malicious files (e.g., webshells) to the server, which allows them to execute arbitrary code and gain control over the affected system.
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through the "create survey" functionality.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the "create survey" function. However, the article mentions that attackers can bypass authentication using CVE-2017-14322 in older versions (< 6.1.6).
