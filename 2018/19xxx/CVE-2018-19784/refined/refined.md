```
Root cause of vulnerability: The `str_rot_pass` encryption function in PHP-Proxy is flawed, making decryption too easy even if the default key is changed.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
  - Weak encryption: The `str_rot_pass` function is easily reversible, allowing an attacker to decrypt the key.
  - Local File Inclusion (LFI): By decrypting the key, an attacker can manipulate requests to include local files.

Impact of exploitation: An attacker can exploit the weak encryption to decrypt the key and then leverage this to perform Local File Inclusion attacks.

Attack vectors: The attack is performed remotely, exploiting the weak encryption implementation of the application.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the PHP-Proxy application. They do not need prior access or authentication to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker can decrypt the encryption key and craft malicious requests to perform LFI.
