- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper access control allowed users with the Reporter role to access the Jaeger tracing operations page, which should have been restricted to Maintainer and Owner roles.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Privilege escalation due to incorrect permission checks for the Jaeger tracing operations page.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Users with lower roles (Reporter) can access sensitive information related to Jaeger tracing configurations within projects they shouldn't have access to.
- **Attack vectors:** By directly accessing the URL `[https://gitlab.com/[username]/[Project\_namespace]/settings/operations](https://gitlab.com/%5Busername%5D/%5BProject_namespace%5D/settings/operations)`, a user with the Reporter role can bypass the UI restrictions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a user with the Reporter role in a project where Jaeger tracing is configured and know the project URL.
