Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-19936:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The PrinterOn Enterprise application fails to properly validate the URI entered by a user in the web page field when printing. This allows an attacker to input a local file path instead of a valid web address.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** The primary weakness is the ability to delete arbitrary files on the host system. This is achieved by providing a file path to the application through a web page URI field, which is then processed by the application.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application doesn't check if the provided URI is a valid web address.
- **Insecure File Handling:** The application does not validate the file path for access and security before attempting to process it for printing, resulting in deletion of the file.
- **Privileged Process:** The software runs under a local administrator account ("PONservice"), increasing the impact of the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** An attacker can delete any file on the host system that is not currently in use by the system.
- **Application Unusability:** Deletion of critical system or application files can make the application and potentially the entire host system unusable.
- **System Instability:** Removing key configuration or software components can lead to unpredictable behavior and system instability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploitable through the web interface (CPS URL: `https://<hostname or ip>/cps`).
- **Web page field:** The attacker enters a file path in the web page field when printing via web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to PrinterOn Enterprise Web Interface:** The attacker needs access to the PrinterOn Enterprise web interface to initiate a print job.
- **Guest or Authenticated User:** The attacker can be either a guest user (if enabled) or an authenticated user of the system.
- **Knowledge of target system:** Attacker needs to know the path to a file on the system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The software runs under a local administrator account (PONservice), which provides greater access and impact.
- The default configuration of the application to "Delete From Store" after printing is exploited, where the "store" is the file path specified by the user.
- The exploit was confirmed against PrinterOn Enterprise version 4.1.4 running on Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter, and the fix was confirmed by the vendor.

This detailed analysis provides a clear picture of the vulnerability, its exploitation, and the potential impact, and aligns with the information found in the provided resources, specifically the Exploit-DB entry.
