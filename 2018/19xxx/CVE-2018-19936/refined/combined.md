# Exploit Author: bzyo
# CVE: CVE-2018-19936
# Twitter: @bzyo_
# Exploit Title: PrinterOn Enterprise 4.1.4 - Arbitrary File Deletion
# Date: 12-07-18
# Vulnerable Software: PrinterOn Enterprise 4.1.4
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.printeron.com/
# Version: 4.1.4

Tested On
---------------------------------------------------------------------
PrinterOn Enterprise 4.1.4
Windows 2012 R2 Datacenter
Software running under User Account: PONservice (part of local administrators group)

Software Notes
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Per the PrinterOn Enterprise 4.1.4 Installation Guide on Page 10, a local administrator account is required to run the software.

On a default installation, the Post Print Option is to “Delete From Store”.  Meaning, if you upload a file to print, this file is deleted immediately after it is printed.

When printing as a Guest or Authenticated user, you have the choice of either uploading a file to be printed or entering a Web Page.  The file type you upload or supply via URI needs to be supported by the application in order for it to process and print.  Per page 11 of the installation guide, under Recommended Software, it’s advised to install an application such as Microsoft Word to print .docx documents.  There is also some additional configuration needed to be able to print specific file types otherwise you receive an error such as “This type of file cannot be processed by your service”.

Vulnerability
---------------------------------------------------------------------
When either printing as a Guest (when enabled) or as an Authenticated user via the CPS URL https://<hostname or ip>/cps, the user printing has the ability to delete any file on the host system that isn’t currently in use by the system itself.  The field to enter a web page does not properly check the URI being entered, as such the user can enter a system file path and delete a file on the system.

Exploit
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Login as either Guest or an Authenticated user to print
	https://<hostname or ip>/cps
Choose any printer
Entering a system path to a file in the web page field
 	Examples:
		C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\DoNotDelete.txt
		C:\Program Files (x86)\PrinterOn Corporation\Apache Tomcat\Conf\web.xml
Send the print job, an error will show
Check system, file is deleted

Impact
---------------------------------------------------------------------
By deleting specific files the application, and possibly the host system, can become unusable.

Timeline
---------------------------------------------------------------------
10-22-18: Vendor notified of vulnerability
10-22-18: Initial response from vendor
10-23-18: PoC submitted
10-25-18: Vendor to pass along to Product team
11-??-18: New version released
12-03-18: Tested and Confirmed with vendor vulnerability fixed in update
12-07-18: Submitted public disclosure

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
