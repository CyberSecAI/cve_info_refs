  "Root cause of vulnerability": "An illegal address access occurs in the `sixel_helper_set_additional_message` function due to a null pointer dereference when attempting to use `strlen` on an invalid address.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Null pointer dereference leading to a segmentation fault.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability causes a segmentation fault, leading to a crash of the application.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by processing a crafted input file (POC1) with the `img2sixel` tool which utilizes the libsixel library.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a malicious input file to an application using libsixel, specifically through the `img2sixel` utility."
