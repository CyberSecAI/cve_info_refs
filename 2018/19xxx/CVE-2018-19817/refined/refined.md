The provided content indicates that CVE-2018-19817 is related to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in VistaPortal SE Version 5.1 (build 51029).

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper input sanitization in the `AdminAuthorisationFrame.jsp` page, specifically within the `ConnPoolName` and `GroupId` parameters. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session. This could potentially lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing of sensitive information
    - Defacement of the web page
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL with malicious JavaScript code in the `ConnPoolName` and `GroupId` parameters of the `/VPortal/mgtconsole/AdminAuthorisationFrame.jsp` page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to convince a user to click a malicious link or visit a compromised website that contains the malicious link. The attacker does not need any special privileges or access to the application server.
