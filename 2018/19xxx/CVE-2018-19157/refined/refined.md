Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability 1: "I Can't Believe It's Not Stake"**

*   **Root Cause:**  Lack of proper validation of coinstake transactions before committing blocks to memory or disk. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the "headers first" feature adopted from Bitcoin where block propagation is split into two messages: Header and Block. The coinstake transaction is only present in the Block message, not the Header, so some PoS implementations do not validate it, leading to a resource exhaustion.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **RAM Exhaustion:** Nodes store block headers in an in-memory data structure (`mapBlockIndex`) without validating the coinstake transaction. Attackers can send many fake headers, filling up RAM.
    *   **Disk Exhaustion:** Nodes store blocks on disk after only performing minimal preliminary validation based on the header. Since the coinstake transaction is not validated, attackers can send many invalid blocks, filling up disk space.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**  Node crashes due to resource exhaustion (RAM or disk). Disk exhaustion may require manual intervention to resolve.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Network attacker sending malformed headers or blocks.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** No stake is required. An attacker only needs network connectivity to a vulnerable node.

**Vulnerability 2: "Spent Stake Attack"**

*   **Root Cause:** Incomplete validation of coinstake transactions. The preliminary checks in some PoS implementations only check if a coin exists in the main chain's transaction database (TxDB), but not if it is unspent.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Spent Output Reuse:** Attackers can reuse spent outputs in coinstake transactions.
    *   **Stake Amplification:**  Attackers can create a series of transactions that spend coins back to themselves, creating multiple UTXOs and amplifying their apparent stake.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Ability to mine blocks with a very small amount of stake, enabling the attacker to fill a victim's disk with invalid blocks.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Network attacker sending malformed blocks using "amplified stake"
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Requires a small amount of stake in the cryptocurrency.

**Key Points:**

*   **Heuristic Validation:** The root cause of both vulnerabilities is the use of heuristic/approximate checks for coinstake validation due to the complexity of full validation.
*   **"Headers First" Feature:** The "headers first" optimization from Bitcoin, when not implemented correctly in PoS, leads to these vulnerabilities.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:**  Both attacks lead to resource exhaustion (RAM or disk), causing node crashes.
*   **Chain Split Risk:** Mitigations like fixed-length partial validation introduce the risk of chain splits.
*   **Coordinated Disclosure:** The research team performed a coordinated vulnerability disclosure to multiple cryptocurrency projects.
*  **Affected Currencies**: The article names a number of cryptocurrencies that were found to be affected including Qtum, Particl, Navcoin, HTMLcoin, and Emercoin
