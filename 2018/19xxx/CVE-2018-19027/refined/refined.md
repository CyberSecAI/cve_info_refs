- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Type confusion vulnerabilities exist when processing project files in Omron CX-Protocol.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Three type confusion vulnerabilities (CWE-843) exist when processing project files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute code under the privileges of the application.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted project file is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to provide a malicious project file to the affected software. The advisory notes the attack vector is local and requires user interaction (UI:R), implying the user must open the malicious project file.
