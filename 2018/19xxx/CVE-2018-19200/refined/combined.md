Package        : uriparser
Version        : 0.8.0.1-2+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-19198 CVE-2018-19199 CVE-2018-19200

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in uriparser, an Uniform Resource
Identifiers (URIs) parsing library.

CVE-2018-19198

    UriQuery.c allows an out-of-bounds write via a uriComposeQuery* or
    uriComposeQueryEx* function because the '&' character is mishandled in
    certain contexts.

CVE-2018-19199

    UriQuery.c allows an integer overflow via a uriComposeQuery* or
    uriComposeQueryEx* function because of an unchecked multiplication.

CVE-2018-19200

    UriCommon.c allows attempted operations on NULL input via a uriResetUri*
    function.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
0.8.0.1-2+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your uriparser packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

2008-09-01 -- 0.7.2
 \* Fixed: Bad cleanup logic in functions - uriAddBaseUri(..) - uriRemoveBaseUri(..) Previously you needed to call uriFreeUriMembers on return code URI\_ERROR\_MALLOC and only then. So that's why these functions now take cleanup off your shoulders. An extra call to uriFreeUriMembers from your side is still needed in case of success. \* Soname: 1:7:0
2008-04-27 -- 0.7.1
 \* Fixed: Bogus syntax error when parsing URIs with port-like passwords, e.g. "http://user:21@host/" (SF.net bug #1) Thanks to Friedrich Delgado Friedrichs for reporting! \* Fixed: Parser did not handle trailing slashes correctly in some cases, which also made the structures produced from parsing "http://e.com/" and "http://e.com" indistinguishable. (SF.net bug #2) Thanks to Edward Z. Yang for reporting!
2008-04-04 -- 0.7.0

2008-02-11 -- 0.6.3

2007-09-13 -- 0.5.2
 \* Added: RemoveBaseUri function to create URI references \* Added: Unix/Windows filename <--> URI string conversion helpers \* Added: EscapeEx function to escape text blocks without zero termination \* Fixed: Bug in ToString for URIs with scheme, path, but no host (e.g. "f:/.//g") \* Fixed: AddBase now resolves ".//g" with base "f:/a" to "f:/.//g" instead of "f://g" which would result in "g" becoming the authority part when parsing a recomposition (ToString) of that URI structure. This is a whole in RFC 3986, see http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/uri/2007Aug/0003.html for details.
2007-08-09 -- 0.5.1
