## 4. MITIGATIONS

Rockwell Automation has released new firmware to address the vulnerability. Download the latest version of the firmware from:

<https://compatibility.rockwellautomation.com/Pages/MultiProductDownload.aspx?Keyword=25B&crumb=112>

Rockwell Automation recommends the following general security guidelines:

* Utilize proper network infrastructure controls, such as firewalls, to help ensure CIP messages from unauthorized sources are blocked.
* Block all traffic to EtherNet/IP or other CIP protocol-based devices from outside the manufacturing zone by blocking or restricting access to TCP and UDP Port 2222 and Port 44818, using proper network infrastructure controls, such as firewalls, UTM devices, or other security appliances. For more information on TCP/UDP ports used by Rockwell Automation Products, see Knowledgebase Article ID [898270](https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/898270/page/1) (login required).
* If applicable, consult the product documentation for specific features, such as a hardware key-switch setting, which may be used to block unauthorized changes, etc.
* Use trusted software, software patches, antivirus/antimalware programs, and interact only with trusted websites and attachments.
* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet or the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.
