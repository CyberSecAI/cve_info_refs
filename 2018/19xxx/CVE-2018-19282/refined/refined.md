- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the device's uncontrolled resource consumption when processing specific CIP (Common Industrial Protocol) packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is uncontrolled resource consumption, leading to a resource exhaustion condition. This is categorized as CWE-400.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to resource exhaustion, denial of service, and potentially memory corruption, disrupting the availability of the affected device.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is remote and unauthenticated. An attacker can exploit this by repeatedly sending specific CIP packets to the affected PowerFlex 525 drive.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the affected device, but does not require prior authentication. Low skill level is required for exploitation.
