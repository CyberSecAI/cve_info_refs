## Description

[![@cve-reporting](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36542150?v=4&size=48)](/cve-reporting)[cve-reporting](https://github.com/cve-reporting)opened [on Jul 11, 2018](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/issues/600#issue-340218161)

Function `parse_publish_vhdr()` that parses `MQTT PUBLISH` messages with variable length header (see details in: <http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/mqtt-protocol-messages-overview/>) tries to `memcpy` input data into fixed size buffer.

Allocated buffer can fit only `MQTT_MAX_TOPIC_LENGTH` (64) bytes and the length check is missing.

Declaration of buffer:

```
contiki-ng/os/net/app-layer/mqtt/mqtt.h:226-228
	struct mqtt_message {
	  uint32_t mid;
	  char topic[MQTT_MAX_TOPIC_LENGTH + 1]; /* +1 for string termination */

contiki-ng/os/net/app-layer/mqtt/mqtt.h:111
	#define MQTT_MAX_TOPIC_LENGTH 64
```

Overflow: `contiki-ng/os/net/app-layer/mqtt/mqtt.c:895`

```
    memcpy(&conn->in_publish_msg.topic[conn->in_packet.topic_pos],
           &input_data_ptr[*pos],
           copy_bytes);
```

This could lead to Remote Code Execution via stack smashing attack (overwriting the function return address).

Proposed CVSS score:

```
CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H (10.0 - Critical)

```

Mitigation:

The size of data copied to topic buffer should be limited to `MQTT_MAX_TOPIC_LENGTH`.

Crash details using Address Sanitizer (line number could not match to original sources):

Extra Data:
   Description: Segmentation fault on program counter
   Short description: SegFaultOnPc (3/22)
   Explanation: The target tried to access data at an address that matches the program counter. This is likely due to the execution of a branch instruction (ex: 'call') with a bad argument, but it could also be due to execution continuing past the end of a memory region or another cause. Regardless this likely indicates that the program counter contents are tainted and can be controlled by an attacker.
