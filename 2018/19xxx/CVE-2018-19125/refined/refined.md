Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-19125:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from insecure handling of file uploads and processing within the TinyMCE filemanager plugin in PrestaShop. Specifically, the `image_size` action in the filemanager was vulnerable. This was combined with the ability to upload files and then trigger deserialization, leading to remote code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The core issue is the ability to trigger a PHP deserialization vulnerability using a specially crafted phar archive. This is achieved by uploading a file with a .pdf extension (but actually a phar archive) and then tricking the application into processing it.
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application allows the upload of files without proper validation, which is then leveraged to upload a malicious phar archive.
*   **Vulnerable File Manager Action:** The `image_size` action of the file manager was used to trigger the deserialization flaw.
*   **Insufficient Path Validation:** The vulnerability involves bypassing a realpath check by renaming the upload directory. The path is also manipulated to include `/img/cms/`, which is used to bypass a check.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation leads to **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** on the server hosting the PrestaShop application. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data breaches, and further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Authentication:** The attacker needs a valid back-office account (e.g., logistician, translator, salesman).
2.  **File Upload:** The attacker uploads a specially crafted PHP phar archive disguised as a PDF file using the file manager.
3.  **Directory Manipulation:** The attacker renames the upload directory to bypass a `realpath` check.
4.  **Deserialization Trigger:** The attacker triggers the deserialization via the vulnerable `image_size` action of the file manager using the malicious phar file. This allows the execution of attacker-controlled PHP code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must have a valid back-office account with privileges to access the file manager.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable PrestaShop instance.

**Additional Details:**
*   The exploit leverages a gadget chain in the Monolog library to achieve remote code execution during deserialization.
*   The exploit script provided renames the upload directory to bypass a realpath() check and includes the `/img/cms/` string to bypass another check.
*   The vulnerability is present in PrestaShop versions 1.6.x prior to 1.6.1.23 and 1.7.x prior to 1.7.4.4
