Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-19752:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `assets/add/registrar.php` file within the DomainMOD application. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user-supplied input provided in the "Registrar Name", "Registrar URL", and "Notes" fields.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a stored XSS. This means that malicious JavaScript code injected through the vulnerable fields is permanently stored within the application's database. When other users with permission to view the vulnerable page access this data, the stored script will execute in their browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML code. This allows the attacker to:
    - Steal session cookies and potentially hijack user accounts.
    - Redirect users to malicious websites.
    - Perform actions on behalf of the victim.
    - Modify displayed content, potentially leading to phishing or other attacks.
- **Impact on Multiple Users:** Since the XSS is stored, all users who access the vulnerable page will be affected.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack is performed via the web interface of the DomainMOD application.
- **Specific Page:** The vulnerability is located in `/assets/add/registrar.php`.
- **Vulnerable Fields:** The attacker injects malicious code into "Registrar Name," "Registrar URL," and "Notes" fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid account on the DomainMOD application and have the privilege to access the vulnerable page, which allows adding/editing registrar information.
- **Payload Injection:** The attacker needs to be able to input data into the "Registrar Name," "Registrar URL," or "Notes" fields.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit example uses the payload `"><img src=x onerror=alert("Xssed-By-Abdul-Raheem")>`. This payload demonstrates the ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript, which could be replaced with more malicious code.
- The vulnerability affects versions v4.09.03 to v4.11.01 of DomainMOD.
- The github issue #84 includes a proof of concept of this vulnerability.
