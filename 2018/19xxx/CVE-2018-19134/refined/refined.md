{
  "CVE-2018-19134": {
    "Description": "The setpattern operator did not properly validate certain types. A specially crafted PostScript document could exploit this to crash Ghostscript or, possibly, execute arbitrary code in the context of the Ghostscript process. This is a type confusion issue because of failure to check whether the Implementation of a pattern dictionary was a structure type.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Missing type check in `zcolor.c` when handling the setpattern operator. The code doesn't validate the type of `pPatInst` before using it, leading to type confusion when parsing malicious PostScript.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Type confusion due to missing type validation.",
       "Access to arbitrary pointer"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code within the context of the Ghostscript process.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "A specially crafted PostScript document is processed using Ghostscript.",
      "Opening a malicious PDF file",
      "Browsing a directory with a malicious file (thumbnail generation)"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted PostScript or PDF document to Ghostscript or trigger thumbnail generation."
