RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

Package        : ghostscript
Version        : 9.06~dfsg-2+deb8u13
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-19134 CVE-2018-19478

Some vulnerabilities were discovered in ghostscript, an interpreter for the
PostScript language and for PDF.

CVE-2018-19134

    The setpattern operator did not properly validate certain types. A specially
    crafted PostScript document could exploit this to crash Ghostscript or,
    possibly, execute arbitrary code in the context of the Ghostscript process.
    This is a type confusion issue because of failure to check whether the
    Implementation of a pattern dictionary was a structure type.

CVE-2018-19478

    Attempting to open a carefully crafted PDF file results in long-running
    computation. A sufficiently bad page tree can lead to us taking significant
    amounts of time when checking the tree for recursion.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
9.06~dfsg-2+deb8u13.

We recommend that you upgrade your ghostscript packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=700141#c0)  Man Yue Mo    2018-11-08 11:35:29 UTC  ``` Hi,  There is a missing type check in line 292 of zcolor.c:  <http://git.ghostscript.com/?p=ghostpdl.git;a=blob;f=psi/zcolor.c;h=74b428801eda5c75d70cf55e88c407484b554527;hb=5a4fec2a34af925993192e197ab666fe542b79d3#l292>  Here `pPatInst` comes from the first array element of `pImpl`  <http://git.ghostscript.com/?p=ghostpdl.git;a=blob;f=psi/zcolor.c;h=74b428801eda5c75d70cf55e88c407484b554527;hb=5a4fec2a34af925993192e197ab666fe542b79d3#l289>  which comes from `op`:  <http://git.ghostscript.com/?p=ghostpdl.git;a=blob;f=psi/zcolor.c;h=74b428801eda5c75d70cf55e88c407484b554527;hb=5a4fec2a34af925993192e197ab666fe542b79d3#l286>  The type of `pPatInst` is not checked and is used in `r_ptr`, which accesses its `pstruct` value and then cast it into `gs_pattern_instance_t`. As `op` is an untrusted argument, this can lead to type confusion issue when parsing malicious postscript. (Access to arbitrary pointer)  For example:  ./gs -q -sDEVICE=ppmraw -dSAFER GS><< /Implementation [16#[4141414141](http://www.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/findgit.cgi?4141414141)] >> setpattern Segmentation fault (core dumped)  This is tested with a build of commit `[5a4fec2](http://www.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/findgit.cgi?5a4fec2)` (latest of current master)  Thank you very much for your help and please let me know if there is anything I can help or if you have trouble reproducing the issue.

If you want one, probably best to go ahead and do it. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=700141#c4)  Man Yue Mo    2018-11-09 09:35:00 UTC  ``` Thanks. I've requested a CVE ID. I'll let you know when I got the ID. Are you happy with the following description?  The ghostscript setpattern operator did not properly validate certain types. A specially crafted PostScript document could exploit this to crash ghostscript or, possibly, execute arbitrary code in the context of the ghostscript process.  Thanks. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=700141#c5)  Ken Sharp    2018-11-09 09:40:59 UTC  ``` (In reply to Man Yue Mo from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=700141#c4))  > The ghostscript setpattern operator did not properly validate certain types. > A specially crafted PostScript document could exploit this to crash > ghostscript or, possibly, execute arbitrary code in the context of the > ghostscript process. >  > Thanks.  I'm doubtful you could execute arbitrary code, though I'm no expert in the field. I've no problems with the description. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=700141#c6)  Ken Sharp    2018-11-09 09:42:28 UTC  ``` Forgot to mention it, not sure if its relevant, the fix is in the Release Candidate for 9.26 which is available as of about 30 minutes ago. Obviously it'll be in the 9.26 release when that rolls out. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=700141#c7)  Man Yue Mo    2018-11-09 10:04:42 UTC  ``` Thanks. The 'execute arbitrary code' clause is rather standard for this kind of issues (e.g. <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2018-15909>) It simply states the maximum possible impact. I personally agree with you that it probably can't execute arbitrary code (and I haven't tried it myself either) on its own and do not intend to exaggerate the issue, but am just following standard practices. Thanks! ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=700141#c8)  Man Yue Mo    2018-11-09 11:39:38 UTC  ``` Thanks for the heads up about the release. I've got a CVE ID for this: CVE-2018-19134. I've asked them to reserve the details until the release is out. By the way, you can actually use this to execute command, but you need to know the address of the appropriate function to do so, so executing arbitrary command would probably still requires knowledge of the memory layout, which probably still requires other bugs (e.g. another information leak bug). e.g. with ASLR turned off in gdb:  gdb --args ./gs -q -sDEVICE=ppmraw -dSAFER -dDEBUG  p system $1 = {int (const char *)} 0x7ffff65f7440 <__libc_system>  GS><</Implementation [[16#[4141414141414141](http://www.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/findgit.cgi?4141414141414141) [16#51 16#[7ffff65f7440](http://www.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/findgit.cgi?7ffff65f7440)]]] >> setpattern [New process 1726] [Thread debugging using libthread_db enabled] Using host libthread_db library "/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libthread_db.so.1". process 1726 is executing new program: /bin/dash sh: 1:          : not found ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=700141#c9)  Man Yue Mo    2018-11-13 11:57:37 UTC  ``` I noticed that the affected code is duplicated in `patterncomponent`:  <http://git.ghostscript.com/?p=ghostpdl.git;a=blob;f=psi/zcolor.c;h=3b8849ff33b11ef3ed2fb73dd009cf5cd06fd69f;hb=2dceb0400c5a571f23070891b8a8028d04926de1#l4805>  This can be reached from `setcolor_cont`  <http://git.ghostscript.com/?p=ghostpdl.git;a=blob;f=psi/zcolor.c;h=3b8849ff33b11ef3ed2fb73dd009cf5cd06fd69f;hb=2dceb0400c5a571f23070891b8a8028d04926de1#l6088>  from `setpattern`.

I am not totally sure whether the check that is already > in place in the commit will also make this one safe, but it may be good just > to add those checks in `patterncomponent`. Thanks.  You can't get to setcolor_cont without first going through setcolor, if the check against the Implementation fails there then you'll never get to patterncomponent, if it succeeds, then its valid for patterncomponent too.  So yes, this fix already covers it. We'd prefer not to add extra checking where its not required, as this has a performance penalty. ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=700141#c11)  Man Yue Mo    2018-11-22 20:06:48 UTC  ``` Just a heads up, I managed to turn this bug into full arbitrary command execution, so please make sure distro maintainers are aware of it when deciding whether to back-port this fix or not. Thanks. ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=700141#c12)  Cedric    2018-12-04 14:21:33 UTC  ``` Hi all, I am wondering if the issue is currently under embargo. My understanding is "probably not", since it's fixed in 9.26. :) but I prefer get a confirmation first before publishing the existence of that bug (so far, I have not found any public info yet) ``` |  |

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other usersâ€™ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a programâ€™s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hatâ€™s CVE database.

When a technologyâ€”enabled and most likely used by defaultâ€”completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-trackingÂ  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.Â  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.Â  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.Â  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.Â  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.Â  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1655599#c0)  Cedric Buissart    2018-12-03 14:20:57 UTC  ``` There is a missing type check in line 292 of zcolor.c:  <http://git.ghostscript.com/?p=ghostpdl.git;a=blob;f=psi/zcolor.c;h=74b428801eda5c75d70cf55e88c407484b554527;hb=5a4fec2a34af925993192e197ab666fe542b79d3#l292>  Here `pPatInst` comes from the first array element of `pImpl`  <http://git.ghostscript.com/?p=ghostpdl.git;a=blob;f=psi/zcolor.c;h=74b428801eda5c75d70cf55e88c407484b554527;hb=5a4fec2a34af925993192e197ab666fe542b79d3#l289>  which comes from `op`:  <http://git.ghostscript.com/?p=ghostpdl.git;a=blob;f=psi/zcolor.c;h=74b428801eda5c75d70cf55e88c407484b554527;hb=5a4fec2a34af925993192e197ab666fe542b79d3#l286>  The type of `pPatInst` is not checked and is used in `r_ptr`, which accesses its `pstruct` value and then cast it into `gs_pattern_instance_t`. As `op` is an untrusted argument, this can lead to type confusion issue when parsing malicious postscript. (Access to arbitrary pointer)   Upstream bug: <https://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=700141>  Upstream fix: <http://git.ghostscript.com/?p=ghostpdl.git;a=commitdiff;h=693baf02152119af6e6afd30bb8ec76d14f84bbf>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1655599#c3)  Cedric Buissart    2018-12-05 09:12:13 UTC  ``` Created ghostscript tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1656320](show_bug.cgi?id=1656320 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-19134 ghostscript: Type confusion in setpattern (700141) [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1655599#c5)  Cedric Buissart    2018-12-05 12:38:31 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Please refer to the "Mitigation" section of [CVE-2018-16509](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-16509) : <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2018-16509>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1655599#c6)  Bas van Schaik    2018-12-11 12:18:53 UTC  ``` This vulnerability allows remote code execution when a user opens a specially-crafted PS or PDF file, or when a user uses the file explorer to browse a directory containing such a file (triggering thumbnail generation). [CVE-2018-19134](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-19134) was patched upstream on 8 November (<http://git.ghostscript.com/?p=ghostpdl.git;h=693baf02152119af6e6afd30bb8ec76d14f84bbf>), and a new Ghostscript version containing the patch was released three weeks ago on 20 November (version 9.26: <https://www.ghostscript.com/doc/9.26/News.htm>).  Debian/Ubuntu patched the vulnerability in November. As it stands, users of RedHat, Fedora, and CentOS are still vulnerable.  I'm part of the team at Semmle; my colleague Man Yue Mo discovered the vulnerability. We take coordinated/responsible disclosure very seriously. With the patch committed to a public Git repository and a new release been made available three weeks ago, we consider the details of this vulnerability to be public knowledge. Please be aware that we will therefore imminently publish more information about the discovery of this vulnerability.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1655599#c7)  Cedric Buissart    2018-12-12 09:18:25 UTC  ``` We are aware of the code execution potential of this vulnerability, and the flaw is treated as Important. We are currently actively working on a solution to resolve the different recently discovered flaws without creating regressions.  It is to be noted that starting from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6, the thumbnailer is executed in a sandbox.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1655599#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-12-17 19:58:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2018:3834 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3834](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A3834)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1655599#c10)  Cedric Buissart    2018-12-18 08:40:21 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is now in Maintenance Support 2 Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle. This has been rated as having a security impact of Important, and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/>.   ``` |  |

Human progress depends on the open source community. One of the biggest issues facing developers today is how to create and consume open source in a secure and trusted way. And at GitHub, we have a unique opportunity and responsibility to provide the tools, best practices, and infrastructure to make software development secure.

Today weâ€™re announcing a big step in securing the open source supply chain: weâ€™re [welcoming Semmle to GitHub](https://blog.semmle.com/secure-software-github-semmle/).

Semmleâ€™s revolutionary semantic code analysis engine allows developers to write queries that identify code patterns in large codebases and search for vulnerabilities and their variants. Semmle is trusted by security teams at Uber, NASA, Microsoft, Google, and has helped find thousands of vulnerabilities in some of the largest codebases in the world, as well as over 100 CVEs in open source projects to date.

Security researchers use Semmle to quickly find vulnerabilities in code with simple declarative queries. These teams then share their queries with the Semmle community to improve the safety of code in other codebases. Software security is a community effort; no single company can find every vulnerability or secure the open source supply chain behind everyoneâ€™s code. Semmleâ€™s community-driven approach to identifying and preventing security vulnerabilities is the very best way forward.

To learn more about our approach to developer security, check out [a detailed overview of secure development on GitHub](https://github.blog/2019-09-18-securing-software-together/) from Shanku Niyogi, SVP of Product. The [Semmle blog](https://blog.semmle.com/) has many videos and examples of Semmle in action, and you can check out your favorite open source projects on Semmleâ€™s [lgtm.com](https://lgtm.com).

Weâ€™re so excited to be joined by the Semmle team and to welcome their world class engineers and security researchers to GitHub. Together, weâ€™ll bring their work to all open source communities and to our customers. As a community of developers, maintainers, and researchers, we can all work together toward more secure software for everyone.
