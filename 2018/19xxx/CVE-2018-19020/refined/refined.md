The provided content is related to CVE-2018-19020.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by the application's failure to properly validate the value of an offset when processing project files.

**Weakness:**
Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125) vulnerability is present. When processing project files and tampering with the value of an offset, an attacker can force the application to read a value outside of an array.

**Impact:**
An attacker could cause the application to read data outside of the array bounds, which could result in a limited information disclosure. The confidentiality impact is low, and no impact to integrity or availability are expected as a result of this vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is local and requires a user to open a specially crafted project file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker requires the ability to create a malicious project file and to convince a user to open the crafted project file on the vulnerable system.  The attacker must have local access to the system.
