The provided content details multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in ThinkCMF X2.2.2.

**Vulnerability 1:**
*   **Root cause:** Improper handling of the `ids` parameter in `CommentadminController.class.php`'s `check` and `delete` methods. The `ids` parameter, received via POST, is directly concatenated into the SQL query without proper sanitization.
*   **Weakness:** SQL Injection due to direct concatenation of user-controlled input into SQL queries.
*  **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modifications, or complete database compromise.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint with a malicious `ids` parameter.
*   **Required capabilities:** Manager privileges are required.

**Vulnerability 2:**
*   **Root cause:** Direct use of the `parentid` parameter in the `edit_post` method of `NavController.class.php` without sanitization. The value is directly included in a where clause.
*   **Weakness:** SQL Injection due to unsanitized user-supplied input being used directly in SQL queries.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary SQL query execution, potentially allowing an attacker to read, modify or delete data.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted POST request to the `edit_post` endpoint with a malicious `parentid` parameter.
*   **Required capabilities:** Manager privileges.

**Vulnerability 3:**
*   **Root cause:** Improper handling of the `ids` parameter in the `delete` method of `SlideController.class.php`. The `ids` are imploded into a string and directly used in a SQL `IN` clause.
*   **Weakness:** SQL Injection. The application uses user-controlled input directly in a SQL `IN` clause without sanitization.
*   **Impact:** Ability to execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to unauthorized access or manipulation of the database.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a POST request to the vulnerable `delete` endpoint with a crafted `ids` parameter.
*   **Required capabilities:** Manager privileges are required.

**Vulnerability 4:**
*   **Root cause:** Vulnerability exists within the `_listorders()` method in `AdminbaseController.class.php`, which is called by various controllers for sorting operations. The `listorders` parameter is processed as an array, and if the first element of the array is `exp`, then the second element is directly concatenated into the SQL query.
*  **Weakness:** SQL Injection. The application directly concatenates unsanitized user-controlled input into an SQL query.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary SQL query execution, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data modification.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a POST request to an endpoint that uses the `_listorders()` method, such as `LinkController`, with a malicious `listorders` payload.
*   **Required capabilities:** Manager privileges.

**Vulnerability 5:**
*   **Root cause:** The application uses ThinkPHP 3.2.3, which has a known `bind` SQL injection vulnerability. The `id` parameter in `ArticleController.class.php`'s `edit_post` method is vulnerable to a `bind` injection.
*  **Weakness:** SQL Injection due to insecure use of `bind` in the underlying ThinkPHP framework.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary SQL query execution, potentially leading to unauthorized access or modification of data.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a POST request to the `edit_post` method with a crafted `post[id]` parameter.
*  **Required capabilities:** Normal user privileges.

These vulnerabilities highlight a lack of proper input sanitization and validation, leading to direct injection of user-supplied data into SQL queries. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the underlying database.
