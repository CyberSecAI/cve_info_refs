The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in Interspire Email Marketer, but only the arbitrary file upload vulnerability is relevant to the specified CVE. The content describes the following:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The "create survey" function allows uploading files of any type when the "allow all file type" option is enabled, without proper sanitization or restrictions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted file upload
- Lack of file type validation
- Accessible temporary directory

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution by uploading a webshell (e.g., a PHP file)
- Complete server compromise possible

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker uses the "create survey" functionality.
-  "Allow all file types" option must be enabled.
-  The attacker uploads malicious files, such as PHP webshells, through the survey creation process.
- After the survey submission, the uploaded file can be accessed directly via a predictable URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated user with access to the survey creation functionality.
- The attacker might use CVE-2017â€“14322 to bypass authentication in older versions, however this is not strictly required.
