Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-19968:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an error within the transformation feature of phpMyAdmin. This error allows for the inclusion of local files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion:** The primary weakness is the ability to include and potentially expose local files on the server.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The transformation feature likely lacks proper input validation, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local File Disclosure:** An attacker can leak the contents of local files, which could contain sensitive information such as configuration files, source code, or other sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network through the phpMyAdmin web interface.
*   **Web Application:** The attack targets the phpMyAdmin application directly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid phpMyAdmin Credentials:** The attacker must possess valid credentials to log in to phpMyAdmin. The vulnerability cannot be exploited without authentication.
*   **Access to Configuration Storage Tables:** The attacker needs access to the phpMyAdmin Configuration Storage tables. While these tables can be created in any database the attacker has access to, this is still a requirement.
