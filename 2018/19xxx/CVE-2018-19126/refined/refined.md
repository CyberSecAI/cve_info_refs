      "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability is present in the TinyMCE filemanager plugin. The exploit involves uploading a specially crafted phar file disguised as a valid image, renaming the upload directory to bypass path checks, and then triggering deserialization by calling the image_size action with a crafted path parameter. The vulnerability is a combination of CVE-2018-19126 and CVE-2018-19125 and can be exploited using the provided `exploit.php` script."
