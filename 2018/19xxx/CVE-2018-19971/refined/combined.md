# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

Subject: [FD] CVE-2018-19971: JFrog Artifactory Pro SAML SSO signature
 validation error

CVE-2018-19971: JFrog Artifactory Pro SAML SSO signature validation error
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Affected products
=================

The SAML SSO addon in Artifactory 6.5.9 is vulnerable.
The SAML SSO addon in Artifactory 6.5.13 is NOT vulnerable.

Other versions were not tested.

Background
==========

  "Artifactory offers a SAML-based Single Sign-On service allowing
  federated Artifactory partners (identity providers) full control over
  the authorization process.

  Using SAML, Artifactory acts as service provider which receives
  users' authentication information from external identity providers.
  The SAML SSO addon in Artifactory Pro"

  -- [https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/SAML+SSO+Integration](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/SAML%2BSSO%2BIntegration)

Description
===========

The SAML SSO addon in Artifactory 6.5.9 does not properly validate the
XML signature in the SAMLResponse field send to the URL
/webapp/saml/loginResponse. An attacker can use this flaw to login as
any user if they already can login as some user.

Let's assume that the attacker has obtained a valid SAML message of
the form

Root
- Assertion id="original"
   - Subject
- Signature
  - SignedInfo
    - Reference URI="original"

where the URI attribute of the Reference element points to the
Assertion element.

If we introduce a new Assertion element and make the original
Assertion and Signature elements its children we end up with the
message

Root
- Assertion id="evil"
  - Subject
  - Assertion id="original"
    - Subject
  - Signature
   - SignedInfo
     - Reference URI="original"

When Artifactory processes this message it looks for the Signature
element and checks that the original assertion is signed
properly. However, it then proceeds to use the Subject information
from the evil assertion which is fully under attacker's control.

Exploit
=======

If you want to test this vulnerability you can fetch a fork of the
SAMLRaider tool from <https://github.com/lindi2/SAMLRaider> and then
select "XSW9" from the drop-down list.

You might also want to take a look at the SAMLRaider documentation
that shows how this variant differs from earlier similar
vulnerabilities:

<https://github.com/lindi2/SAMLRaider/blob/af73ee4a71e3125188496da29a83799fdb41d8e8/src/main/resources/xswlist.png>

(The original documentation contained only bitmap images of text so it
was not very easy to add new variants.)

Author
======

This issue was discovered by Timo Lindfors from Nixu Corporation.

Timeline
========

2018-12-07: Issue reported to vendor.
2018-12-08: Mitre assigns CVE-2018-19971 to this vulnerability.
2018-12-17: JFrog releases a fix in Artifactory 6.5.13.

# Into the Sunset on May 1st: Bintray, GoCenter, and ChartCenter

**UPDATE 7/2/2024:** After over three years of maintaining JCenter as a read-only repository for legacy Java packages, JFrog is moving forward with an official sunset of JCenter, and, in coordination with Maven Central, will begin automatically redirecting all JCenter requests to the Maven Central Repository. The first of several service brown-outs is scheduled for **July 30th** and will periodically continue until the **final shutdown** of JCenter on **August 15th**. For more details, please see [JFrog’s official announcement](https://jfrog.com/blog/jcenter-sunset/).

**UPDATE 4/27/2021:**We listened to the community and will keep JCenter as a read-only repository indefinitely. Our customers and the community can continue to rely on JCenter as a reliable mirror for Java packages.

**UPDATE 2/28/2021:** To better support the community in this migration, JFrog has extended the JCenter **new package versions submission** deadline through **March 31st 2021**.

JFrog is making some important changes that will impact users of Bintray, JCenter (part of Bintray), GoCenter, and ChartCenter.

Bintray has provided the open source community a free, universal cloud platform for publishing and distributing binaries. Bintray helped JFrog support the Java community as the host of the JCenter repository for Java OSS libraries, packages and components. We launched GoCenter and ChartCenter to extend similar services to the Go and cloud-native communities.

JFrog is evolving to meet the new challenges that developers face. Many of the services that Bintray provides are now served by the JFrog Platform for the open source community. Similarly, the Go and Helm communities have since created central repositories of their own that are drop-in replacements for our centers.

To streamline the productivity of the JFrog Platform we will be sunsetting Bintray, GoCenter, and ChartCenter services on May 1st, 2021. Users of these services will need to migrate to the respective canonical repository, and we will continue to offer both [trial and paid JFrog Platform cloud subscriptions](https://jfrog.com/pricing/#sass) that can serve other binary distribution needs. Additionally, JFrog is partnering with hubs like [Docker](https://jfrog.com/blog/jfrog-docker-partnership-for-dockerhub/) to help ensure that infrastructure our customers and community depend upon is well maintained.

ConanCenter, which we [announced](https://blog.conan.io/2020/01/13/New-Conan-Center-Improves-Search-Discovery.html) last January, will be going forward with additional investment to make it an even better resource for C and C++ developers relying on [Conan packages](https://jfrog.com/integration/conan-package-manager/). Expect continuous improvement in the developer experience for ConanCenter over the years to come.

The changes are coming in these phases:

| **When** | **What’s Changing** |
| --- | --- |
| Now | Bintray, JCenter, GoCenter, and ChartCenter service continues. Bintray/JCenter users should start migrating to a new hosting solution. |
| February 28th, 2021 | No more submissions will be accepted to GoCenter, and ChartCenter The GoCenter and ChartCenter websites will be disabled (client requests will still work). |
| March 31st, 2021 | No more submissions will be accepted to JCenter. |
| April 12th, 26th, 2021 | We will have some short service brown-outs to remind users about the services that are going away on May 1st. (Specific hours will be advertised in the Bintray status page.) |
| May 1st, 2021 | Bintray services will no longer be available. GoCenter, and ChartCenter services will no longer be available to non-Artifactory clients. (ConanCenter and JCenter are not affected). |

Here are some answers to questions you’re likely to have:

**What happens after the sunset of Bintray?**

On May 1, 2021, the sunset will impact all existing Bintray users. Bintray users will be blocked and will no longer be able to use the Bintray service. This includes existing software distribution, account administrative access, UI access, and the REST API.

**What is the community alternative for GoCenter and ChartCenter?**

The Go team has built a module repository for Go developers called [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/) that can be used as a direct replacement for GoCenter. Similarly the Helm community has built a chart and package library called [ArtifactHub](https://artifacthub.io/) that can be used as a replacement for ChartCenter.

**I’m a Bintray Enterprise or Bintray Pro customer. What help should I expect?**

Bintray Enterprise and other select customers are being contacted by their JFrog account reps to help ensure their migration goes smoothly. They will provide sufficient support to confirm that you have successfully obtained all of your Bintray data, and validate that the content is no longer being downloaded before account disablement and data deletion.

**What happens to my data after Bintray is sunset?**

All of the data on Bintray is available for download through May 1st and we encourage you to transfer it out. JFrog will begin deleting data several weeks after the official sunset date and will not retain any Bintray data after that.

**I have Artifactory remote repositories configured to use JCenter, GoCenter, or ChartCenter. Will this break them?**

Artifactory installations with remote repositories configured against JCenter, GoCenter, and ChartCenter will **not** be affected by this sunset.

We recommend that JFrog Cloud customers continue using jcenter.bintray.com, gocenter.io, and repo.chartcenter.io as Artifactory remote repositories going forward.

JFrog self-hosted customers can also continue fetching from these repositories, but are encouraged to migrate to the canonical repositories.

**I have other questions about subscribing to the JFrog Platform. Who can I contact?**

If you need more answers, please feel free to contact us on Twitter [@JFrog](http://twitter.com/jfrog).

# CVE-2018-19971: JFrog Artifactory Pro SAML SSO signature validation error

---

*From*: Timo Lindfors <timo.lindfors () iki fi>

CVE-2018-19971: JFrog Artifactory Pro SAML SSO signature validation error
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Affected products
=================

The SAML SSO addon in Artifactory 6.5.9 is vulnerable.
The SAML SSO addon in Artifactory 6.5.13 is NOT vulnerable.

Other versions were not tested.

Background
==========

 "Artifactory offers a SAML-based Single Sign-On service allowing
 federated Artifactory partners (identity providers) full control over
 the authorization process.

 Using SAML, Artifactory acts as service provider which receives
 users' authentication information from external identity providers.
 The SAML SSO addon in Artifactory Pro"

 -- [https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/SAML+SSO+Integration](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/SAML%2BSSO%2BIntegration)

Description
===========

The SAML SSO addon in Artifactory 6.5.9 does not properly validate the
XML signature in the SAMLResponse field send to the URL
/webapp/saml/loginResponse. An attacker can use this flaw to login as
any user if they already can login as some user.

Let's assume that the attacker has obtained a valid SAML message of
the form

Root
- Assertion id="original"
  - Subject
- Signature
 - SignedInfo
   - Reference URI="original"

where the URI attribute of the Reference element points to the
Assertion element.

If we introduce a new Assertion element and make the original
Assertion and Signature elements its children we end up with the
message

Root
- Assertion id="evil"
 - Subject
 - Assertion id="original"
   - Subject
 - Signature
  - SignedInfo
    - Reference URI="original"

When Artifactory processes this message it looks for the Signature
element and checks that the original assertion is signed
properly. However, it then proceeds to use the Subject information
from the evil assertion which is fully under attacker's control.

Exploit
=======

If you want to test this vulnerability you can fetch a fork of the
SAMLRaider tool from <https://github.com/lindi2/SAMLRaider> and then
select "XSW9" from the drop-down list.

You might also want to take a look at the SAMLRaider documentation
that shows how this variant differs from earlier similar
vulnerabilities:

<https://github.com/lindi2/SAMLRaider/blob/af73ee4a71e3125188496da29a83799fdb41d8e8/src/main/resources/xswlist.png>

(The original documentation contained only bitmap images of text so it
was not very easy to add new variants.)

Author
======

This issue was discovered by Timo Lindfors from Nixu Corporation.

Timeline
========

2018-12-07: Issue reported to vendor.
2018-12-08: Mitre assigns CVE-2018-19971 to this vulnerability.
2018-12-17: JFrog releases a fix in Artifactory 6.5.13.
