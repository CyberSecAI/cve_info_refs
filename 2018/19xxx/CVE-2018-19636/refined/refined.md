Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-19636:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `supportutils` script, when executed with the `-A` command-line argument, searches the filesystem for a binary named `ndspath`. The script uses `grep` on the output of `find / -print` to locate the binary. If a user is able to insert a file named `ndspath` at an arbitrary location, the script will locate and then execute the file as root.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unsafe Binary Search:** The script's method for locating the `ndspath` binary is flawed. It relies on a text-based search of the output of `find / -print` using grep and `locate` . This allows an attacker to create a malicious file named `ndspath` at any location and have it be executed with root privileges.
*   **Insecure Execution:** Once located, the `ndspath` script is executed without proper sanitization or verification, allowing an attacker to run arbitrary commands with root privileges.
* **Unrestricted File System Access:** supportutils searches the entire file system for `ndspath` without restrictions or checks to limit where it is located.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code with root privileges.
*   **Full System Compromise:** With root access, an attacker can potentially take complete control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the vulnerable system.
*   **File System Manipulation:**  The attacker must be able to create files on the local filesystem.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have local access (shell access) to the system.
*   The attacker must be able to write to the file system in a location where it will be found by the find/locate search.
*   The attacker must have sufficient access to trigger the `supportconfig` script with the `-A` argument.
*   A low privileged user can create a file that will be executed by root.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided text indicates that the `NDS_INST_FILES` variable was also vulnerable using the same mechanism. This is when supportconfig collects information about the eDirectory instances.
*   The vulnerability was fixed by removing the code that searches the filesystem and instead, uses a hardcoded path for eDirectory configuration files.
* The severity is rated as "important".
