- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation within the application, allowing directory traversal through the use of "dot dot" sequences (/../) in URL requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can send a specially crafted URL to view arbitrary files on the system.
- **Attack vectors:**  A remote attacker sends a crafted HTTP request containing directory traversal sequences.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable IBM Security Key Lifecycle Manager server.
