Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1115:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `pg_logfile_rotate()` function within the `adminpack` extension of PostgreSQL. This function, intended to rotate log files, was found to have overly permissive access control lists (ACLs).  It did not enforce the same restrictions as the core `pg_rotate_logfile` function, which requires superuser privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect ACL Implementation:** The primary issue is the inconsistent application of access control between the `pg_logfile_rotate()` and `pg_rotate_logfile()` functions. `pg_logfile_rotate()` was improperly accessible to any user once the adminpack extension was added to a database, while the underlying function had restricted access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Forced Log Rotation:** An attacker with the ability to connect to a database where the `adminpack` extension is enabled can force a log rotation.  While not directly a confidentiality or integrity breach, this can disrupt logging activities. 
*   **Potential for denial of service (indirect):** Forced log rotations could lead to the server running out of disk space in some configurations or disrupt log analysis tools.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attack vector is through network connections to a PostgreSQL database.
*   **SQL Injection:** Although not explicitly stated, the advisory suggests that the function could be used in an attack chain that included SQL Injection.
*   **Function Execution:** The attacker must be able to execute the vulnerable function within a database that has the adminpack extension enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must be able to connect to the PostgreSQL server over the network.
*   **Database User:** The attacker must have a valid username and password that allows them to connect to the target database instance.
*   **Database Access:** The attacker must have some level of access to a database where the `adminpack` extension is installed.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability is present in PostgreSQL versions before 10.4, 9.6.9,
*   SUSE categorizes this vulnerability as "critical".
*   CVSS v2 and v3 scores are provided, highlighting the severity of the issue. The CVSSv3 score is 9.1, indicating a critical vulnerability.
*   The content also includes multiple references to the security advisories, Bugzilla entries, and lists of released packages related to this CVE in various SUSE products, and Red Hat Software collections showing this vulnerability has been resolved.
