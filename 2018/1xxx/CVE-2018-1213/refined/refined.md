{
  "CVE-2018-1213": {
    "Root cause": "The web interface lacks anti-CSRF tokens in forms, allowing for cross-site request forgery.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can submit authenticated requests when an authenticated user browses an attacker-controlled domain. This allows for actions like adding new users with SSH access or re-mapping storage directories to grant read/write/execute access.",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can craft a malicious web page that, when visited by an authenticated user, sends unauthorized requests to the vulnerable Isilon OneFS web console.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to lure an authenticated user to visit a malicious webpage they control. The attacker does not need prior access to the system. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable."
