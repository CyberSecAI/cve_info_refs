- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization which allows for the embedding of arbitrary JavaScript code within the Web UI of IBM Jazz Reporting Service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the web UI, potentially leading to altered functionality and credentials disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is conducted by embedding malicious JavaScript code into the web UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a user of the application with the capability to inject the malicious script. The CVSS vector indicates that a low privileged user (PR:L) is sufficient and user interaction (UI:R) is required.
