Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-1171:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within DTrace DOF files in Joyent SmartOS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Out-of-bounds write: The insufficient validation of user-supplied data allows an attacker to write data past the end of an allocated memory object.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Privilege escalation: Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to execute code with the privileges of the host operating system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access: The attacker needs to execute low-privileged code on the target system to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to gain initial access to execute low-privileged code on the affected SmartOS system.
- The attacker needs to manipulate the DTrace DOF files with malicious input.

**Additional Details:**
- Joyent has released an update to patch this vulnerability.
