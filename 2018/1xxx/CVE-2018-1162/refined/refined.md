- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path before using it in file operations within the handling of Export requests in Quest NetVault Backup.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is a directory traversal vulnerability resulting from insufficient input validation. This allows attackers to manipulate the file paths used by the application.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful attack can lead to arbitrary file overwrites, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the affected Quest NetVault Backup server.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is remotely exploitable and involves sending manipulated Export requests to the vulnerable service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a valid session, although the authentication mechanism was easily bypassable. The attacker needs the ability to interact with the service remotely.
