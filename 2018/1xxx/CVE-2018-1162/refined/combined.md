| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 8.5, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:C/A:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:C/A:C) |

| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [NetVault Backup](https://www.quest.com/products/netvault-backup/) |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to create a denial-of-service condition on vulnerable installations of Quest NetVault Backup. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be easily bypassed.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of Export requests. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to arbitrarily overwrite files resulting in a denial-of-service condition. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | This vulnerability is being disclosed publicly without a patch in accordance with the ZDI 120 day deadline.  05/26/17 - ZDI wrote to Dell requesting a disclosure contact for the product05/29/17 - Dell responded and provided a vendor contact at Quest05/29/17 - ZDI reached out to the provided contact05/30/17 - The contact provided a PGP key to accept disclosure06/20/17 - The contact provided a group mailing list for further disclosures05/30/17 - 6/22/17 - ZDI reported 25 vulnerabilities to the contact and/or the group list07/03/17 - The vendor asked clarifying questions07/03/17 - ZDI responded07/10/17 - ZDI responded with further information11/02/17 - ZDI wrote the contact and the group list requesting a status update11/17/17 - The ZDI PM called and left a message for the contact and emailed the contact and the group list requesting a status update12/06/17 - The ZDI PM met with the vendor team by phone at their request and explained the intent to 0-day the reports  This is now fixed with NetVault v11.4.5.15.  -- Mitigation:Given the nature of the vulnerability, the only salient mitigation strategy is to restrict interaction with the service to trusted machines. Only the clients and servers that have a legitimate procedural relationship with the service should be permitted to communicate with it. This could be accomplished in a number of ways, most notably with firewall rules/whitelisting. |
