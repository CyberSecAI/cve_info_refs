## 1.0 Whatâs New?

eDirectory 9.1 provides the following key features, enhancements, and fixes in this release:

### 1.1 New Features

This release introduces the following new features:

#### Support for Auditing with CEF

This release introduces Common Event Format (CEF), a standard event format to facilitate the merging and analysis of audit information from multiple components at the distributed system level. The CEF format uses the Syslog message format as a transport mechanism. CEF is an extensible text-based format that is designed to support multiple device types such as on-premise devices and cloud-based services. For more information, see [Auditing with CEF](https://www.netiq.com/documentation/edirectory-91/edir_admin/data/t44e7j6b8ufi.html) in the [eDirectory Administration Guide](https://www.netiq.com/documentation/edirectory-91/edir_admin/data/bookinfo.html).

#### New Installer for Windows

eDirectory introduces a new installer for Windows to simplify and improve its install and upgrade processes. Using the new installer, eDirectory installation becomes much faster compared to its previous versions. For more information, see [Installing or Upgrading NetIQ eDirectory on Windows](https://www.netiq.com/documentation/edirectory-91/edir_install/data/ahna7o7.html) in the [eDirectory Installation Guide](https://www.netiq.com/documentation/edirectory-91/edir_install/data/bookinfo.html).

#### Support for LDAP Extended DN Control

This version of eDirectory provides LDAP Extended DN Control which is used with an extended LDAP search to request an extended form of object Distinguished Name. The extended form includes a string representation of Object GUID along with Distinguished Name of the object. For more information, see [LDAP Extended DN Control](https://www.netiq.com/documentation/edirectory-91/edir_admin/data/t4562rkcaudt.html) in the [eDirectory Administration Guide](https://www.netiq.com/documentation/edirectory-91/edir_admin/data/bookinfo.html).

### 1.2 Enhancements

This release introduces the following enhancements:

#### Support for Certificates with 8192-bit RSA Keys

Using this version of eDirectory, you can create CA or server certificates with 8192-bit RSA encryption. Ensure that you are using eDirectory 9.1, iManager 3.1 and eDirectory 9.1 PKI Plug-in before configuring a server certificate with 8192-bit RSA public key. For more information, see [Using 8192 Bit RSA Keys in Certificates](https://www.netiq.com/documentation/edirectory-91/edir_admin/data/a2ebon6.html#a2ebona) in the [eDirectory Administration Guide](https://www.netiq.com/documentation/edirectory-91/edir_admin/data/bookinfo.html).

#### Support for Customizing Default Certificate Generation

This version of eDirectory provides three new options for configuring the CA or server certificates while configuring a new eDirectory server. Using these options, you can set the RSA key size, EC Curve limit and the certificate life for your certificates. For more information, see [Creating an Organizational Certificate Authority Object](https://www.netiq.com/documentation/edirectory-91/edir_admin/data/b1j4t87q.html#b1j4tbj3) in the [eDirectory Administration Guide](https://www.netiq.com/documentation/edirectory-91/edir_admin/data/bookinfo.html).

#### Performance Improvement for Indexing

This version of eDirectory provides the support for prefixing the Ancestor ID with the list of attributes passed while creating a new index. For more information, see [Using LDAP Tools on Linux](https://www.netiq.com/documentation/edirectory-91/edir_admin/data/a6qjdjx.html#akiydau) in the [eDirectory Administration Guide](https://www.netiq.com/documentation/edirectory-91/edir_admin/data/bookinfo.html).
