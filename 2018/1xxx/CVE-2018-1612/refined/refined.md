Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-1612:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the IBM QRadar Incident Forensics web application that allows an attacker to bypass authentication. This is achieved by fixating session cookies, specifically the SEC and QRadarCSRF cookies.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Authentication Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass authentication by manipulating session cookies, allowing unauthorized access to the application.
2. **Remote Code Execution:** Chaining this authentication bypass with other vulnerabilities allows for remote code execution. This involves writing a file to disk as the "nobody" user and then escalating privileges to execute a shell script as root.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to:

1. **Bypass Authentication:** Gain unauthorized access to the IBM QRadar Incident Forensics web application.
2. **Execute Arbitrary Code:** Achieve remote code execution on the affected system with root privileges.
3. **Data Exposure:** Access potentially sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

1. **Network:** The attacker exploits this vulnerability remotely over the network.
2. **HTTP Requests:** The attack involves sending crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1. **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable IBM QRadar system.
2. **No Prior Authentication:** The vulnerability is triggered without prior authentication.
3. **Chaining of Vulnerabilities:** The attacker needs to chain the authentication bypass with other vulnerabilities to achieve RCE, including writing to disk and exploiting the autoupdate patch feature.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Products:** IBM QRadar SIEM 7.2.0 - 7.2.8 Patch 11 and IBM QRadar SIEM 7.3.0 - 7.3.1 Patch 4.
*   **Mitigation:** The vendor provides patches and a workaround.
*   **Exploit:** A Metasploit module is available to automate the exploit.
*   **Three-Stage Exploit:** The exploit is a three-stage process: (1) bypass authentication, (2) write a file and execute it as nobody, (3) escalate to root using an update mechanism.
*   **Payload Constraints:** The exploit is constrained to a generic reverse shell payload.
