- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the IBM Maximo Asset Management web UI, allowing users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow attackers to alter intended functionality, potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the web UI of the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to embed JavaScript code within the web UI, which may require a low level of access (PR:L). The vulnerability also requires user interaction (UI:R) to be triggered, indicating the user has to interact with the maliciously crafted web content.
