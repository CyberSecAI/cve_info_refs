Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-1513

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization, allowing a malicious user to inject arbitrary JavaScript code within the web UI by manipulating the first name (`fname`) and last name (`lname`) parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input when updating user profile information. This allows an attacker to embed malicious JavaScript code that is persistently stored and executed when other users interact with the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser.
- **Credentials Disclosure:** Malicious scripts could potentially steal session cookies or other sensitive information, leading to account compromise within a trusted session.
- **Altered Functionality:** Attackers can manipulate the behavior of the web application, potentially leading to unintended consequences.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web UI:** The attack is carried out through the web user interface of the IBM Sterling B2B Integrator.
- **Malicious User Input:** The attacker inserts malicious JavaScript payloads into the "first name" and "last name" fields of a user profile.
- **Persistent Storage:** The malicious input is saved and displayed when other users view the "Last Edited By" field in the Performance Tuning module.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have an account with privileges to modify user profile information. This can be any user who can update their account details.
- **Access to Web UI:** The attacker must have access to the IBM Sterling B2B Integrator's web interface.
- **Privileges to Change Configuration:**  Specifically, they need the privilege to modify configuration settings.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable "fname" and "lname" parameters and how they are displayed on the application interface.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered specifically within the Performance Tuning module under the Operations section.
- Any user who has access to the Performance Tuning tab is vulnerable to this exploit.

This vulnerability is present in IBM Sterling B2B Integrator versions 5.2.0.1 through 5.2.6.3 and is resolved by applying Fix Pack 5020603\_6.
