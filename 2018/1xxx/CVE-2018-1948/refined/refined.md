Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1948:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The IBM Security Identity Governance Virtual Appliance does not set the `secure` attribute on authorization tokens or session cookies.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of `secure` attribute on cookies, which allows the cookies to be sent over insecure HTTP connections.
- This can expose the session and authorization tokens when transmitted over unencrypted channels, making them vulnerable to network sniffing.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can obtain the cookie values by sending an `http://` link to a user or by planting this link in a site the user visits.
- By capturing the cookie values, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to the user's session.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted `http://` link to a user.
- Planting a malicious `http://` link on a website the user visits.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the user and the IBM Security Identity Governance Virtual Appliance.
- This can be done by man-in-the-middle attacks or by snooping the traffic on the network.
- The attacker needs to trick the victim into visiting an insecure `http://` link.
