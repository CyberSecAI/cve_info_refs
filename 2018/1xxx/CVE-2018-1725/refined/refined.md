- **Root cause of vulnerability**:  The vulnerability exists in IBM QRadar SIEM when configured in a multi-tenant environment.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure vulnerability. Specifically, sensitive information could be exposed across different tenants in the multi-tenant environment.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Sensitive information could be disclosed to unauthorized tenants.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability exists within the software itself, but requires a multi-tenant configuration to be exploitable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to have access to the multi-tenant QRadar SIEM instance as a tenant user.
