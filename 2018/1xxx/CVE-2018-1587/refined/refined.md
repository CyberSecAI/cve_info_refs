Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1587:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the exposure of technical error messages.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability lies in the application's failure to properly handle and conceal technical error messages. This allows an attacker to observe details about the application and database.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploiting this vulnerability allows an attacker to gain information about the application and database. This information can be used to conduct further attacks. The confidentiality of system information is affected.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), meaning the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely. The attack is considered low complexity (AC:L) and requires a low level of privileges (PR:L). User interaction is not required (UI:N). The attack impacts only the vulnerable component (S:U).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application and must have low level privileges on the target system.
