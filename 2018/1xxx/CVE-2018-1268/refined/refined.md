The provided content contains information about CVE-2018-1268.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Cloud Foundry Loggregator does not validate the app GUID structure in requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of input validation for app GUIDs in Loggregator requests.

**Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated malicious user with knowledge of an app's GUID can construct malicious requests to read from or write to that app's logs. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive log data or potentially the injection of malicious log entries.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending crafted requests to the Loggregator API.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be an authenticated user in the Cloud Foundry environment.
- The attacker must know the GUID of the target application.
