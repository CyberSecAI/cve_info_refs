- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in IBM Team Concert (RTC), allowing attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code into the Web UI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's session. This could lead to the alteration of intended functionality and potentially the disclosure of credentials within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the web UI of IBM Team Concert. A malicious user can embed the JavaScript code in the web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be a user able to inject malicious javascript into the Web UI. The user needs to be able to inject the script and induce another user to trigger the injected code by visiting the affected page.
