  "CVE-2018-1160": {
    "description": "Netatalk before 3.1.12 is vulnerable to an out of bounds write in dsi_opensess.c. This is due to lack of bounds checking on attacker controlled data. A remote unauthenticated attacker can leverage this vulnerability to achieve arbitrary code execution.",
    "affected_products": [
      "Netatalk 3.1.11 and below",
      "Synology Diskstation Manager (DSM)",
      "Synology Router Manager (SRM)",
      "QNAP devices"
    ],
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Lack of bounds checking in the `dsi_opensession` function when handling the `DSIOPT_ATTNQUANT` option. The size of the data copied into the `attn_quantum` variable is controlled by the attacker without proper validation.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Out-of-bounds write"
      ],
       "impact": "Arbitrary code execution, leading to a complete compromise of the affected system. This can result in data breaches, system downtime, or further attacks.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network",
        "Remote unauthenticated"
