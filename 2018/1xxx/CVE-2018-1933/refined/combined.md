# Security Bulletin: Multiple vulnerabilities affect IBM Planning Analytics (CVE-2018-3180, CVE-2013-1624, CVE-2018-1933, CVE-2015-1832, CVE-2018-15494)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

This Security Bulletin addresses multiple vulnerabilities that have been remediated in IBM Planning Analytics 2.0.7.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2013-1624](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-1624)

**DESCRIPTION:** Bouncy Castle could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by the exposure of timing differences during padding check verification by the CBC ciphersuite of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) implementation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a timing attack to recover the original plaintext and obtain sensitive information.

CVSS Base Score: 5

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/81910> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2015-1832](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1832)

**DESCRIPTION:** Apache Derby could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a XML external entity (XXE) error when processing XML data by the XML datatype and XmlVTI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files on the system or cause a denial of service.

CVSS Base Score: 6.4

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/115625> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:P)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2018-1933](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1933)

**DESCRIPTION:** IBM Planning Analytics is vulnerable to cross-site scripting. This vulnerability allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI thus altering the intended functionality potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.

CVSS Base Score: 5.4

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/153177> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2018-3180](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-3180)

**DESCRIPTION:** An unspecified vulnerability related to the Java SE Embedded JSSE component could allow an unauthenticated attacker to cause low confidentiality impact, low integrity impact, and low availability impact.

CVSS Base Score: 5.6

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/151497> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2018-15494](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15494)

**DESCRIPTION:** Dojo Toolkit is vulnerable to cross-site scripting, caused by improper validation of user-supplied input by the DataGrid component. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to inject malicious script into a Web page which would be executed in a victim's Web browser within the security context of the hosting Web site, once the page is viewed. An attacker could use this vulnerability to steal the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials.

CVSS Base Score: 6.1

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/148556> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined
