- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM Security Key Lifecycle Manager generates error messages that include sensitive information about the environment, users, or associated data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information Exposure through error messages.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exposure of sensitive information related to the application, users, or data to unauthorized parties.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can trigger the generation of error messages containing sensitive information.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to interact with the application and trigger the error messages, which may be through a network connection.
