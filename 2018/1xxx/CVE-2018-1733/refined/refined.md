- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The software fails to adequately filter user-controlled input data for syntax that has control-plane implications. The software makes assumptions about what constitutes data and control, and the lack of verification of these assumptions for user-controlled input leads to injection problems.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Content spoofing/injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A page could be modified to include a misleading message to the victim, which could subject them to further compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: User-controlled input data is not properly filtered.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious content through user-controlled input data.
