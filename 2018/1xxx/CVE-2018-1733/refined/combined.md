# SECURITY BULLETIN: IBM QRadar SIEM is vulnerable to Content Spoofing (CVE-2018-1733)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

The software fails to adequately filter user-controlled input data for syntax that has control-plane implications. Software has certain assumptions about what constitutes data and control respectively. It is the lack of verification of these assumptions for user-controlled input that leads to injection problems. In this case the page could be modified to include a misleading message to the victim which could subject them to further compromise.
