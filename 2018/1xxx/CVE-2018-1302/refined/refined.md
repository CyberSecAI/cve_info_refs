{
  "Root cause": "When an HTTP/2 stream was destroyed after being handled, the Apache HTTP Server prior to version 2.4.30 could have written a NULL pointer potentially to an already freed memory.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Use-after-free"
  ],
  "Impact": "A remote attacker could cause the server to crash, leading to a denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Specially crafted HTTP/2 requests"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP/2 requests to the server."
