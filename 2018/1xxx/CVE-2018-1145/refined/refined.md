Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-1145:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the `EXEC_PROXY_CMD` function in `libcfg.so`. This occurs due to the function using `sprintf` without validating the length of the `url` parameter, which is supplied by an unauthenticated remote user via `proxy.cgi`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow. The `sprintf` function is used to copy the attacker-controlled `url` parameter into a fixed-size stack buffer. If the `url` parameter exceeds the buffer size, it overwrites adjacent memory on the stack.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code fails to validate the length of the `url` parameter before copying it, enabling the buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution:**  By overwriting the stack, an attacker could potentially gain control of program execution by redirecting it to malicious code. This can result in complete control of the device, allowing for arbitrary code execution as root.
- **Denial of Service:** The overflow could crash the device.
- **Data Corruption:** Overwriting the stack can corrupt data, leading to unpredictable behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP request to the `proxy.cgi` endpoint. The malicious input is contained in the `url` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable Belkin N750 device.
- **Unauthenticated:** The attack can be performed by an unauthenticated user.
- **HTTP Request Sending:** The attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted HTTP request.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable code is located in the `EXEC_PROXY_CMD` function in the `libcfg.so` library.
- The `sprintf` function is the source of the buffer overflow.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is located in the Belkin N750 router using firmware version 1.10.22.
- The Tenable advisory indicates that the vulnerability is exploitable without authentication through the web interface.
- The provided example shows an HTTP GET request that exploits this vulnerability with a long string for the `url` parameter to cause the overflow.
