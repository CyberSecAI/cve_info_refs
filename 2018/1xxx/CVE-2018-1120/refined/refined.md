  "response": {
    "root cause": "The procfs filesystem does not properly handle processes mapping some memory elements onto files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of memory mapping onto files by procfs filesystem."

    "impact": "A local attacker could use this to block utilities that examine the procfs filesystem to report operating system state, such as ps(1).",
    "attack vectors": "A local attacker can exploit this by creating a process that maps some memory elements onto files.",
    "required capabilities": "Local attacker able to create processes and perform mmap operations. The attacker needs to be able to create a FUSE filesystem (Filesystem in Userspace) and map it onto the command-line arguments of a process."
