{
  "CVE-2018-1149": {
    "root_cause": "A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `cgi_system` binary due to an unbounded string copy during the construction of a temporary filename.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unbounded string copy",
      "Lack of input validation",
      "Stack buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution (RCE). Additionally, credentials for cameras connected to the NVR are stored in plaintext on the disk, which can be obtained upon successful exploitation.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted HTTP request to the `/cgi-bin/cgi_system` endpoint, with an overly long `PHPSESSID` cookie.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable NVR, and does not need prior authentication."
