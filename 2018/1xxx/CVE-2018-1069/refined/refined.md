Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1069:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that OpenShift does not validate the User ID (UID) and Group ID (GID) of containers before sending them over the OpenShift network. This allows a malicious container to overwrite its UID and GID.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The core issue is the absence of validation for the UID and GID sent over the network by containers within the OpenShift environment.
*   **ID Spoofing:** This lack of validation allows containers to spoof their user and group IDs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized File Access:**  By manipulating its UID/GID, a malicious container can gain unauthorized read and write access to shared network file systems (like GlusterFS and NFS) that rely on these IDs for access control. This enables the attacker to read and write sensitive data on the network filesystem.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Compromised Container:** An attacker would need to deploy or compromise a container within the OpenShift environment.
*   **Network Communication:**  The attack leverages the network communication within OpenShift and the ability of a compromised container to send manipulated UID/GID values.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have the ability to run a container on the OpenShift platform. This could involve:
    *  Compromising an existing container.
    *  Deploying a malicious container through legitimate or unauthorized means.
* The attacker requires knowledge of how the target network file systems are configured and which User ID and Group IDs they want to target.

**Additional Notes**
*   The provided information indicates that this vulnerability is considered "WONTFIX" for Openshift Enterprise 3, due to mitigations being available.
*   Mitigations include using EgressNetworkPolicy to redirect traffic through an egress router, and using static IPs for projects that need access to storage.
*   The vulnerability is mitigated using EgressNetworkPolicy by forcing all storage access to go via a central router with a fixed IP and then having the network storage restrict access to only connections coming from that IP.
