# CVE-2018-1256: Issuer validation regression in Spring Cloud SSO Connector

HIGH | APRIL 30, 2018 | CVE-2018-1256
# Description

Spring Cloud SSO Connector, version 2.1.2, contains a regression which disables issuer validation in resource servers that are not bound to the SSO service. In PCF deployments with multiple SSO service plans, a remote attacker can authenticate to unbound resource servers which use this version of the SSO Connector with tokens generated from another service plan.

# Affected Spring Products and Versions

* Spring Cloud SSO Connector version 2.1.2

# Mitigation

Users of affected versions should apply the following mitigation:

* Releases that have fixed this issue include:
  + Spring Cloud SSO Connector: 2.1.3
* Alternatively, you can perform one of the following workarounds:
  + Bind your resource server to the SSO service plan via a service instance binding
  + Set “sso.connector.cloud.available=true” within your Spring application properties

# Credit

This vulnerability was responsibly reported by the Pivotal SSO Service team.
