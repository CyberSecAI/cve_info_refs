Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1256:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A regression in Spring Cloud SSO Connector version 2.1.2 disabled issuer validation in resource servers that were not bound to the SSO service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Issuer Validation:** The core vulnerability is the lack of proper issuer validation. This means the resource server doesn't verify if the token presented for authentication comes from a trusted source (the correct SSO service plan).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** A remote attacker could authenticate to resource servers not bound to the intended SSO service using tokens generated from a different SSO service plan. This means an attacker could potentially gain access to resources they shouldn't have access to.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The attack is performed remotely.
- **Token Manipulation:** The attacker exploits the lack of issuer validation by using tokens generated from an unintended SSO service plan.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of Multiple SSO Service Plans:** The attacker needs to be aware of multiple SSO service plans within the PCF deployment.
- **Ability to Obtain Valid Tokens from a Different Service Plan:** The attacker needs to have the capability to acquire valid authentication tokens from an SSO service plan that the target resource server is not bound to.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specific to Spring Cloud SSO Connector version 2.1.2.
- The document provides mitigations, including upgrading to version 2.1.3 or applying workarounds like binding the resource server to the SSO service or setting `sso.connector.cloud.available=true`.
- The vulnerability was reported by the Pivotal SSO Service team.
