- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient validation of user-provided input in an API.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Blind SQL injection
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability allows for blind SQL injection, which could potentially allow an attacker to extract sensitive information or manipulate the database if successfully exploited.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through an API where user-provided input is not properly validated.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to provide input to the vulnerable API.
