Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-1150:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The NUUO NVRMini2 firmware contains a backdoor implemented via a conditional check in the `check_session_is_valid()` function within the PHP codebase. Specifically, if a file named `/tmp/moses` exists, the function bypasses normal session validation and allows unauthenticated access.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Backdoor: The presence of the `/tmp/moses` file acts as a trigger to bypass session authentication checks.
- Insecure Authentication: The backdoor allows for unauthenticated access to user management functions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Account takeover: An unauthenticated remote attacker can list all non-admin users and change their passwords, leading to complete compromise of user accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote access: The vulnerability is exploitable over the network by sending HTTP requests.
- Unauthenticated access: The attacker does not require prior authentication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the NVRMini2 device.
- No specific knowledge of valid user credentials: The attacker does not need to have any existing accounts or credentials on the NVR.
- Ability to send HTTP requests: The attacker needs to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web interface.
- Needs to create file `/tmp/moses` on the file system of the NVR device.

**Additional Information**
- The vulnerability is present in NUUO NVRMini2 version 3.8.0 and below.
- A patch is available in version 3.9.1.
- The vulnerability allows remote listing of user accounts and changing passwords.
- The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v2 base score of 7.5 (High severity) and a CVSS v3 base score of 7.3 (High severity)
