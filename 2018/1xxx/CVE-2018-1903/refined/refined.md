Based on the provided document, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1903:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in IBM Sterling Connect:Direct for UNIX that allows a user with restricted sudo access to specific Connect:Direct executable files to bypass these restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

-   **Sudo Restriction Bypass:** The core weakness is the ability to circumvent the intended restrictions imposed by the `sudo` utility. Although `sudo` is configured to only allow execution of specific Connect:Direct files, a user can escalate privileges beyond that.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Unauthorized Command Execution:** A user with limited `sudo` privileges can use the vulnerability to execute unauthorized commands with expanded privileges on the system. This implies potential for full system compromise, data theft, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Local Access:**  The attacker must have local access to the system where Connect:Direct is installed.
-   **Sudo Access:** The attacker must have existing `sudo` privileges restricted to certain Connect:Direct executable files. The exploit would then allow them to expand beyond these limitations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Local System Access:** The attacker must be able to log in to the system.
-   **Limited Sudo Privileges:** The attacker needs to possess `sudo` privileges to execute a predefined set of Connect:Direct files, which are vulnerable to this exploit.
