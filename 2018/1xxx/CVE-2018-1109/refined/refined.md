Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-1109:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) found in the `braces` npm package. This is caused by an inefficient regular expression used to detect empty braces.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **ReDoS:**  The regular expression `^\{(,+(?:(\{,+\})*),*|,*(?:(\{,+\})*),+)\}` used by the `braces` library to detect empty braces is vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking. This inefficient regex can take an excessive amount of time to process crafted, long input strings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can provide specially crafted input strings to the vulnerable regular expression, leading to excessive CPU consumption and potentially making the application or service unresponsive, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.
- **System Availability:** The primary threat is a reduction in system availability due to the resource exhaustion from the ReDoS attack.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely as the vulnerable component is bound to the network stack.
- **Input Manipulation:** The attack vector involves providing specially crafted input strings to the vulnerable regex.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Special Privileges:** The attacker does not require any prior access to the system or special privileges.
- **Remote:** The attacker can be remote from the system they are attacking.
- **Ability to Provide Input:**  The attacker must be able to send the malicious input string to the application that utilizes the vulnerable regular expression.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects versions of `braces` prior to 2.3.1.
- The vulnerable regex was introduced as an optimization in version 2.2.0 of the `braces` package.
- A patch was issued in version 2.3.1.
- The Snyk advisory has a proof-of-concept for this exploit.
- Red Hat acknowledged the vulnerability, and fixed it in some products, like Red Hat Quay 3.

This detailed information aligns with the official CVE description that mentions a Regular Expression Denial of Service in the `braces` library.
