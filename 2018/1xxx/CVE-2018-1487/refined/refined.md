- **Root cause of vulnerability**: IBM Db2 loads shared libraries from an untrusted path.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Uncontrolled search path element, allowing a malicious user to place a crafted shared library in a location where Db2 will load it. This allows for privilege escalation because the DB2 instance owner executables run with elevated privileges (setuid).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A low privilege user can gain full access to the DB2 instance account by loading a malicious shared library.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required; a low privilege user must be able to write to a directory where DB2 is configured to load shared libraries from.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have write access to a directory where Db2 will load libraries from. The attacker must also be a low-privilege user on the system.
