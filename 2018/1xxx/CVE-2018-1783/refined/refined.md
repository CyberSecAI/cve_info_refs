- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An unprivileged, authenticated user with access to a GPFS node can forcefully terminate GPFS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows an authenticated but unprivileged user to cause a denial-of-service condition.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Forceful termination of GPFS leading to denial of access to data available through GPFS.
- **Attack vectors**: An unprivileged, authenticated user with access to a GPFS node can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to a GPFS node.
