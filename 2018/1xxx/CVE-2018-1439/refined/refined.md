- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is the improper handling of user-supplied input in the IBM Quality Manager (RQM) web interface, allowing for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The web UI of IBM RQM does not properly sanitize user input, allowing attackers to embed malicious JavaScript code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to the alteration of the intended functionality of the web UI. The injected JavaScript code could potentially be used to disclose credentials within a trusted session, steal cookies, or perform other malicious actions in the context of a victim's browser.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the web interface of IBM Quality Manager (RQM). A malicious user with the necessary privileges can embed the harmful JavaScript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A user with the capability to input data into the web UI is required, meaning a user with at least some privileges or permissions within the RQM application.
