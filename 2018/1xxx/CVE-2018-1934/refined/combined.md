## Vulnerability Details

 **CVEID:** [CVE-2019-4046](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-4046)

 **CVEID:** [CVE-2018-3139](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-3139)
  **DESCRIPTION:** An unspecified vulnerability related to the Java SE Networking component could allow an unauthenticated attacker to obtain sensitive information resulting in a low confidentiality impact using unknown attack vectors.
CVSS Base score: 3.1
CVSS Temporal Score: See: <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/151455> for the current score.
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

 **CVEID:** [CVE-2018-3180](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-3180)
  **DESCRIPTION:** An unspecified vulnerability related to the Java SE JSSE component could allow an unauthenticated attacker to cause low confidentiality impact, low integrity impact, and low availability impact.
CVSS Base score: 5.6
CVSS Temporal Score: See: <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/151497> for the current score.
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)

 **CVEID:** [CVE-2018-1934](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1934)
  **DESCRIPTION:** IBM Cognos Business Intelligence is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery which could allow an attacker to execute malicious and unauthorized actions transmitted from a user that the website trusts.
CVSS Base score: 4.3
CVSS Temporal Score: See: <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/153179> for the current score.
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

 **CVEID:** [CVE-2018-1305](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1305)
  **DESCRIPTION:** Security constraints defined by annotations of Servlets in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.4, 8.5.0 to 8.5.27, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.49 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.84 were only applied once a Servlet had been loaded. Because security constraints defined in this way apply to the URL pattern and any URLs below that point, it was possible - depending on the order Servlets were loaded - for some security constraints not to be applied. This could have exposed resources to users who were not authorised to access them.
CVSS Base score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See: <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/139475> for the current score.
CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N)

 **CVEID:** [CVE-2018-1304](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1304)
  **DESCRIPTION:** The URL pattern of "" (the empty string) which exactly maps to the context root was not correctly handled in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.4, 8.5.0 to 8.5.27, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.49 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.84 when used as part of a security constraint definition. This caused the constraint to be ignored. It was, therefore, possible for unauthorised users to gain access to web application resources that should have been protected. Only security constraints with a URL pattern of the empty string were affected.
CVSS Base score: 7.5
CVSS Temporal Score: See: <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/139476> for the current score.

 **CVEID:** [CVE-2018-8039](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-8039)
  **DESCRIPTION:** It is possible to configure Apache CXF to use the com.sun.net.ssl implementation via 'System.setProperty("java.protocol.handler.pkgs", "com.sun.net.ssl.internal.[www.protocol&#34](http://www.protocol&#34););'. When this system property is set, CXF uses some reflection to try to make the HostnameVerifier work with the old com.sun.net.ssl.HostnameVerifier interface. However, the default HostnameVerifier implementation in CXF does not implement the method in this interface, and an exception is thrown. However, in Apache CXF prior to 3.2.5 and 3.1.16 the exception is caught in the reflection code and not properly propagated. What this means is that if you are using the com.sun.net.ssl stack with CXF, an error with TLS hostname verification will not be thrown, leaving a CXF client subject to man-in-the-middle attacks.
CVSS Base score: 7.5
