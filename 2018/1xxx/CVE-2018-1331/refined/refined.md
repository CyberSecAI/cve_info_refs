Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-1331

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability allows an attacker with access to a secure Storm cluster to execute arbitrary code as a different user. The specific mechanism isn't detailed, but it involves a flaw in how Storm handles user impersonation or authorization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The vulnerability allows for the execution of arbitrary code.
*   **Improper Authorization/Impersonation:** The core weakness seems to stem from insufficient controls over user impersonation within the secure cluster.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run code of their choosing on the Storm cluster.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker can execute this code as a different user, which could potentially lead to full control of the cluster, or the ability to access sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs access to a secure Storm cluster.
*   **Exploitation of Storm's User Impersonation/Authorization:** The attacker would need to exploit the vulnerability within Storm's handling of user impersonation or authorization to gain the ability to run code as another user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the targeted Storm cluster.
*   **Storm User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account to access the Storm cluster.
*   **Exploitation Knowledge:** The attacker needs to possess the necessary knowledge to exploit the specific vulnerability.

**Affected Versions:**
*   Apache Storm 0.10.0 through 0.10.2
*   Apache Storm 1.0.0 through 1.0.6
*   Apache Storm 1.1.0 through 1.1.2
*  Apache Storm 1.2.0 through 1.2.1
