- **Root cause of vulnerability**: XML Entity Expansion vulnerability
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is due to the improper handling of XML entities. An attacker could craft a malicious XML payload that triggers excessive entity expansion, leading to resource exhaustion.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  The vulnerability can lead to denial of service (DoS) due to excessive resource consumption on the server.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the processing of maliciously crafted XML documents.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide an XML document to the vulnerable application. Specific attacker capabilities are not detailed in this document.
