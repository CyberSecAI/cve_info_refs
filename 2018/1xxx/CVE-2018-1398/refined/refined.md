- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a file access issue in IBM Sterling File Gateway.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  A remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability to download files that might contain sensitive information.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information by allowing the attacker to download files they should not have access to.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is remote, meaning an attacker can exploit it over a network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable IBM Sterling File Gateway instance remotely.
