Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2018-1130:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
* A null pointer dereference exists in the `dccp_write_xmit()` function within `net/dccp/output.c` in the Linux kernel. This occurs because `dccp_disconnect()` sets the `dp->dccps_hc_tx_ccid` handler to NULL. When `dccp_sendmsg()` is called on a disconnected socket, it leads to a null pointer dereference within `dccp_write_xmit()` during subsequent operations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
* **Null Pointer Dereference:** The core weakness is a null pointer dereference. The DCCP socket's transmit handler is not checked for NULL before being used.
* **Improper State Handling:** The code does not properly check if the socket is in a closed state before sending a message, and a null pointer is dereferenced in that condition.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   A local user can cause a **denial of service** (system crash) by triggering the null pointer dereference.

**Attack vectors:**
*   A local user can exploit this vulnerability by using a crafted sequence of system calls on a DCCP socket. 

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be a local user on the system with the capability to load the DCCP modules.
*  The attacker needs the ability to make specific crafted system calls.
*  No special privileges are required (unless DCCP modules are blacklisted, in which case the attacker needs to load the module)

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability was identified by the syzkaller fuzzer.
*   The fix involves adding a check in `dccp_sendmsg()` to ensure the socket is not in a `DCCP_CLOSED` state before proceeding.
*   DCCP modules were often blacklisted by default since RHEL 7.5 out of stability and security concerns, thus requiring manual module loading, meaning an attacker might need to load the dccp modules first to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is present in Linux kernel versions prior to the fix.
*   The vulnerability can also be triggered via IPv6, as shown in one of the commits for a related CVE.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in kernel commit: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=67f93df79aeefc3add4e4b31a752600f834236e2
