Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1305:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability arises from how Apache Tomcat applies security constraints defined by annotations within Servlets. These constraints were only enforced *after* the Servlet had been loaded.
- This late application created a window of opportunity where, depending on the order in which Servlets were loaded, some security constraints might be ignored.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Security Constraint Application:** Security constraints declared through Servlet annotations were not consistently applied at startup time.
- **Servlet Loading Order Dependence:** The order in which Servlets were loaded affected whether their associated security constraints were enforced.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access to Resources:** Attackers could potentially bypass security constraints and gain access to protected web application resources that should have been restricted.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Exploiting Servlet Loading Order:** The vulnerability relies on an attacker understanding and potentially manipulating the order in which Servlets are loaded within the Tomcat application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated users who can interact with the web application over a network.
- **Knowledge of Application Structure:** Attackers need knowledge of the specific Servlet annotations, their related URL mappings, and the possible loading order to exploit the weakness.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in Apache Tomcat versions:
    - 7.0.0 to 7.0.84
    - 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.49
    - 8.5.0 to 8.5.27
    - 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.4
- Some sources also mention that versions prior to 10.0.0-M1 are affected.
- The vulnerability impacts annotations of Servlets.
- Red Hat rates this as a High risk.
