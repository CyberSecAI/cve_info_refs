- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by the failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) in IBM DataPower Gateways.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The absence of HSTS allows for downgrade attacks where an attacker can force a connection to use HTTP instead of HTTPS.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  A successful man-in-the-middle attack can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed over the network. An attacker can intercept communications and downgrade the connection from HTTPS to HTTP.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a position to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, meaning they must be able to intercept network traffic between the client and the DataPower Gateway. The attack can be performed remotely.
