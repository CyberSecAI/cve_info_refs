Package        : advancecomp
Version        : 1.19-1+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-1056 CVE-2019-9210
Debian Bug     : 889270 923416

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in advancecomp, a collection
of recompression utilities.

CVE-2018-1056

    Joonun Jang discovered that the advzip tool was prone to a
    heap-based buffer overflow. This might allow an attacker to cause a
    denial-of-service (application crash) or other unspecified impact
    via a crafted file.

CVE-2019-9210

    The png_compress function in pngex.cc in advpng has an integer
    overflow upon encountering an invalid PNG size, which results in
    another heap based buffer overflow.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1.19-1+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your advancecomp packages.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

Package        : advancecomp
Version        : 1.15-1+deb7u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-1056
Debian Bug     : 889270

Joonun Jang discovered that the advzip tool in advancecomp, a
collection of recompression utilities, was prone to a heap-based
buffer overflow. This might allow an attacker to cause a
denial-of-service (application crash) or other unspecified impact via
a crafted file.

For Debian 7 "Wheezy", these problems have been fixed in version
1.15-1+deb7u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your advancecomp packages.

heap buffer overflow running advzip with "-l poc" option

Running 'advzip -l poc' with the attached file raises heap buffer overflow
which may allow a remote attacker to cause unspecified impact including denial-of-service attack
I expected the program to terminate without segfault, but the program crashes as follow

# USN-3570-1: AdvanceCOMP vulnerability

14 February 2018

AdvanceCOMP could be made to crash or run programs if it opened a specially
crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [advancecomp](/security/cves?package=advancecomp) - collection of recompression utilities

## Details

Joonun Jang discovered that AdvanceCOMP incorrectly handled certain

malformed zip files. If a user or automated system were tricked into

processing a specially crafted zip file, a remote attacker could cause

AdvanceCOMP to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly

execute arbitrary code.

### Reduce your security exposure
