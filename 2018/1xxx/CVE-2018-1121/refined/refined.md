{
  "CVE-2018-1121": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Race condition in the kernel's proc_pid_readdir() function returning /proc/PID entries in ascending numerical order, allowing a process to fork/exec to a lower PID to avoid enumeration.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Race condition",
      "Process hiding"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An unprivileged attacker can hide a process from `procps-ng` utilities.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker leverages inotify events to monitor process list scans, then forks/execs a new process with a lower PID when such scans occur.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Unprivileged attacker on a Linux system with the ability to monitor /proc directory via inotify events."
