- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient HTML iframe protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Frame scripting vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially execute malicious scripts within the context of a victim's browser session by manipulating the iframe elements.
- **Attack vectors**: By exploiting the lack of proper iframe protection, an attacker could potentially inject malicious content into a legitimate page through a crafted iframe.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to inject a crafted iframe element, likely through a separate, malicious web page or by compromising a resource that displays iframes from the affected application. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
