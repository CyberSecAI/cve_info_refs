- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in IBM Rational Quality Manager (RQM).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is vulnerable to XSS, allowing users to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the Web UI.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Successful exploitation could lead to alteration of the intended functionality and potentially lead to credential disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attack vector is through the web interface, where a user can inject malicious JavaScript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A low-privileged user with the ability to interact with the Web UI can exploit the vulnerability. User interaction is required, as the injected JavaScript code will execute in the context of another user's session who interacts with the modified web page.
