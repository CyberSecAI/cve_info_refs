Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a vulnerability within IBM Rational DOORS Next Generation that allows for a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. The specifics of the vulnerable code are not provided, but it's related to how the application handles user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application is susceptible to XSS, meaning it doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it in a web page. This allows an attacker to inject malicious client-side scripts into the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact is that an attacker can inject malicious client-side scripts into the application. This can result in:
  - Execution of malicious code in the victim's browser.
  - Stealing of sensitive information, such as session cookies, which could lead to session hijacking.
  - Redirection of users to attacker-controlled websites.
  - Defacement of the application.
  - Performing actions within the application on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through injecting malicious script into an input field or parameter that is not sanitized when rendered by the application, allowing the attacker to leverage the client side vulnerability present in the web application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to inject malicious script into a vulnerable input field or parameter of the application. This might involve:
  - Manipulating input fields in forms.
  - Injecting malicious scripts in URLs.
- The attacker does not need privileged access, simply the capability to insert malicious code via a web request.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
- Rational Requirements Composer / Rational DOORS Next Generation 5.0 - 5.0.2
- Rational DOORS Next Generation 6.0 - 6.0.6
**Remediation/Fixes**
- Upgrade to the specified iFixes or later.
