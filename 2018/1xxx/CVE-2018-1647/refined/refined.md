- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The software does not properly restrict the size or amount of resources that are requested or influenced by an actor.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unrestricted resource consumption, leading to denial of service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful attack could consume more resources than intended, potentially causing a denial-of-service condition.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by an actor influencing or requesting resources without proper restriction. The specific attack vector isn't explicitly defined, but the description suggests it involves influencing resource allocation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be capable of influencing resource requests or allocations, but no specific position is indicated.
