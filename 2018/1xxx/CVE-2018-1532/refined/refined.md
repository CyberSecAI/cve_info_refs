- **Root cause of vulnerability**: IBM API Connect does not properly update the SESSIONID with each request.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Session management vulnerability, specifically the failure to update the SESSIONID with each request.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially obtain a valid SESSIONID and use it in further attacks against the system. The impact is rated as low confidentiality impact.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access (AV:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  A low-privileged attacker (PR:L) can exploit this vulnerability with no user interaction required (UI:N).
