Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1728:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the product's failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input when rendering the web UI. This allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is XSS, which enables attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Spoofing Attacks: Attackers can alter the intended functionality of the web UI, potentially leading to spoofing attacks. This could involve modifying displayed content, redirecting users, or capturing sensitive data.
- Arbitrary JavaScript Execution: Successful exploitation can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Web UI: The attack vector involves exploiting the web user interface of the IBM QRadar SIEM product. Malicious JavaScript code is embedded into the interface through user-controlled input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- User Access: An attacker needs to have some level of access or the ability to supply data that gets rendered through the vulnerable UI. The specific user role or required permissions are not detailed in the provided document.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
- IBM QRadar SIEM 7.2.0 to 7.2.8 Patch 13
