- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the invalidation logic for data stored in the Local Read Only Cache (LROC). When data is moved from memory to the LROC, changes to the data should trigger invalidation of the LROC copy. However, the invalidation logic can be skipped, leading to stale or incorrect data being read from the LROC.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect invalidation logic in the LROC mechanism.
- **Impact of exploitation**: This can cause stale or incorrect data to be retrieved from the LROC, potentially leading to data corruption in memory and potentially on disks.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when the LROC feature is enabled and data cached in the LROC is modified without proper invalidation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker does not need direct access to exploit this vulnerability. The weakness lies in the internal logic of the LROC mechanism, which can lead to corruption without an external attack, it can be triggered by normal system operations after LROC feature is enabled.
