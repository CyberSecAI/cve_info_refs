- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to dynamic JSP file builds in IBM Platform Symphony and IBM Spectrum Symphony.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Remote Command Execution (RCE) vulnerability due to the way JSP files are built dynamically.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow for remote command execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is present within the WEBGUI service. An attacker could potentially exploit it by crafting malicious requests to the vulnerable JSP files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need network access to the WEBGUI service to exploit the vulnerability. The specific level of access required to exploit the vulnerability is not mentioned in the document, although it seems to affect all users.
