- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `spring-integration-zip` library, specifically the unzip transformer, is vulnerable to arbitrary file write due to insufficient validation of filenames within zip archives. When a specially crafted zip archive contains path traversal filenames, the extraction process concatenates these filenames to the target extraction directory without proper sanitization, leading to files being written outside the intended target folder.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal vulnerability, unsafe file extraction, improper filename sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the server by crafting a malicious zip archive with path traversal filenames.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by providing a crafted zip archive to an application using `spring-integration-zip`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious zip file that will be processed by a vulnerable application using the `spring-integration-zip` library's unzip transformer. The application must accept and unpack zip files from untrusted sources.
