Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2018-1167:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied strings within the processing of URI handlers in the Spotify Music Player. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code through the URI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-controlled input before using it in a system call, enabling command injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system. This code runs under the context of the current process, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URI Handling:** The vulnerability is triggered when the Spotify Music Player processes a specially crafted URI.
- **User Interaction Required:** Exploitation requires user interaction, such as visiting a malicious webpage or opening a malicious file containing the exploit URI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote, meaning they don't need physical access to the target machine.
- **Malicious URI Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted malicious URI.
- **User Luring:** The attacker must lure the user into interacting with the malicious URI.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in Spotify Music Player version 1.0.73.345.
- The vulnerability is identified as ZDI-18-280 / ZDI-CAN-5501 by the Zero Day Initiative.
