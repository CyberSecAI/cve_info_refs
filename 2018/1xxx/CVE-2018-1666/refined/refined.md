- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An authenticated user can inject arbitrary messages that are displayed on the UI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Message injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary messages that are displayed on the UI, potentially leading to user confusion, phishing attempts, or other forms of manipulation. The impact is rated as low (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N), which means the vulnerability has limited impact on confidentiality, but could affect integrity.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based. An attacker can inject arbitrary messages into the UI over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user to exploit this vulnerability.
