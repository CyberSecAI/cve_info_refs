Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1773:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an "unexpected authentication behavior" that allows an authenticated user to bypass future authentication mechanisms after the initial login is completed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability is a flaw in the authentication process that fails to properly enforce authentication after the initial login, allowing a logged-in user to potentially bypass re-authentication. This is an authentication bypass vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit allows an already authenticated user to bypass subsequent authentication checks, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the system and its functionalities without proper re-verification of credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the application itself. The attacker needs to have already authenticated successfully at least once.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the affected Datacap system. The attacker would then be able to bypass future authentications without needing to re-authenticate.
