- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM MQ Managed .NET Client fails to properly validate SSL certificates.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper SSL certificate validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker could obtain sensitive information by using man-in-the-middle techniques.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based man-in-the-middle attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the IBM MQ client and server. The attacker does not require prior authentication (PR:N) and user interaction is not required.
