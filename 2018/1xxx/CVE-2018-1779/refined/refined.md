- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by the lack of limits on JSON payload size within IBM API Connect.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unrestricted JSON payload size handling, leading to a potential Denial of Service.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can cause a denial of service by sending large JSON payloads.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based and involves sending crafted large JSON payloads.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated. They must have network access to the affected API Connect instance.
