Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-1632:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a symbolic link issue within the `IDS .infxdirs` component of IBM Informix Dynamic Server v12.10.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Symbolic Link Vulnerability:** The core issue is that a local user with database administrator privileges can exploit a vulnerability related to symbolic links in the `IDS .infxdirs` directory/component. This suggests that the application might be improperly handling symbolic links, potentially leading to unintended file access or modification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A successful exploit allows a local user who is logged in with database administrator privileges to escalate their privileges to root. This means they can gain complete control over the system.
- **Full System Compromise:** With root access, an attacker can read, modify, or delete data, install malicious software, or disrupt the system entirely.
- The advisory from NetApp also mentions broader impacts from related vulnerabilities, including: "disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS)."

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have access to the server/system where IBM Informix Dynamic Server is running.
- **Database Administrator User:** The attacker must be logged in as a database administrator user to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have local access to the system.
- The attacker must have valid credentials for a database administrator account on the vulnerable IBM Informix Dynamic Server instance.

**Additional Notes:**
