- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM Spectrum Protect Plus application logs user IDs and passwords in plain text within the instrumentation log file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Plain text storage of sensitive credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Disclosure of user credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the system and data.
- **Attack vectors**: Access to the server's file system containing the instrumentation log file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need access to the server's file system where the IBM Spectrum Protect Plus instrumentation logs are stored to read the user ID and password information.
