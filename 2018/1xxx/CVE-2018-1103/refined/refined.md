Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2018-1103:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from unsanitized file paths within the `ExtractTarStreamFromTarReader()` function in the `source-to-image/pkg/tar/tar.go` component of OpenShift.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The code fails to properly sanitize or validate filenames extracted from a tar archive. This allows for the inclusion of path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) in the filenames.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **File Overwrite:** A malicious container can be crafted to include archive entries with path traversal sequences in their filenames. When a client uses `oc rsync` to copy files from such a container, the unsanitized paths cause the client to write extracted files to locations outside of the intended target directory, potentially overwriting arbitrary files on the client's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Container:** An attacker would need to create and deploy a specially crafted container image that contains a tar archive with malicious filenames.
*   **`oc rsync` Command:** The client must use the `oc rsync` command to copy files from the compromised container.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to deploy a malicious container to an OpenShift environment.
* The attacker also requires a victim to use `oc rsync` against a pod based on the malicious image.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability is described as related to but distinct from CVE-2018-1102.
*   The fix for this issue is included in source-to-image version 1.1.10.
*   The issue was reported by Michael Hanselmann.
*   The description specifies the vulnerability is present in "Openshift Enterprise through version 3.6".
