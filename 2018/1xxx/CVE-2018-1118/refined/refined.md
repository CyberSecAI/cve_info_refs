{
  "CVE-2018-1118": {
    "description": "The Linux kernel does not properly initialize memory in messages passed between virtual guests and the host operating system in the vhost/vhost.c:vhost_new_msg() function. This can allow local privileged users to read some kernel memory contents when reading from the /dev/vhost-net device file.",
    "root_cause": "The `vhost_new_msg()` function in the Linux kernel's vhost driver does not initialize message buffers before they are read by user processes.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Information Disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "A local privileged user with access to the `/dev/vhost-net` device file can read potentially sensitive information from kernel memory, or other user's processes.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A local attacker can exploit the vulnerability by reading from the /dev/vhost-net device file.",
      "Local access to the /dev/vhost-net device file is required."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "A local user with access to `/dev/vhost-net` device"
