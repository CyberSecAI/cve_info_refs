Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1053:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `pg_upgrade` tool in PostgreSQL creates temporary files with sensitive data (specifically, the output of `pg_dumpall -g`, which can contain password hashes or other sensitive metadata).
- These temporary files are created using the prevailing umask rather than a fixed restrictive mode. This can make them world-readable if the umask is not sufficiently restrictive.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure File Permissions:** The `pg_upgrade` tool does not use a secure, fixed umask when creating a temporary file. Instead, it relies on the umask of the user executing the program. This allows other local users to potentially access the file if the umask is not restrictive.
- **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** The output of `pg_dumpall -g` includes metadata about database users and permissions, including potentially sensitive information such as password hashes. This information is written to the world readable file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive information, including database user metadata and password hashes.
- **Privilege Escalation (Potential):** While not directly described in the text, if the attacker gains access to password hashes and other db schema info, it is possible to infer other privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** An attacker needs local access to the system where `pg_upgrade` is executed and be able to access the temporary file generated by `pg_upgrade` under a non-restrictive umask. The attacker must be able to search and read the current working directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** The attacker must have a user account on the system where PostgreSQL is installed and running.
- **Knowledge of pg_upgrade execution:** The attacker should also have knowledge that `pg_upgrade` is executed.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in PostgreSQL versions 9.3-10 (per upstream advisory).
- Mitigation (as suggested by upstream): `REVOKE CREATE ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC` to prevent unauthorized users from being able to take advantage of the vulnerability with tools such as `vacuumdb`.

The fix involves using a more secure mode when creating temporary files with `pg_upgrade` using a restrictive directory mode and a restrictive umask preventing access for other users. The provided text also mentions related issues concerning GIN indexes and hash indexes, but these do not directly relate to CVE-2018-1053.

The advisory from Red Hat also indicated that the vulnerability exists in `Red Hat Satellite 5.x` and `CloudForms 5.x`.
