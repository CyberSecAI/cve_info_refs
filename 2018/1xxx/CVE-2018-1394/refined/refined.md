- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The IBM RELM is vulnerable to cross-site scripting. This allows the embedding of arbitrary JavaScript code in the web UI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can alter the intended functionality of the web application, potentially leading to credential disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors:**  A remote attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the web UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires the ability to embed Javascript code, which suggests the attacker requires some level of access or interaction with the application's user interface.
