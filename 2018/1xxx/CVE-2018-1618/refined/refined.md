Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1618:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input validation when processing URL requests. Specifically, the IBM Security Privileged Identity Manager Virtual Appliance does not properly sanitize URL requests containing "dot dot" sequences (`/../`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The vulnerability allows for directory traversal, enabling an attacker to access files outside of the intended web root.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use this vulnerability to view arbitrary files on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via specially crafted URL requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable appliance.
- **Basic Understanding of URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL containing directory traversal sequences.
- **Low Privileges:** The vulnerability is exploitable even with low user privileges.

**Summary:**
CVE-2018-1618 is a path traversal vulnerability in IBM Security Privileged Identity Manager Virtual Appliance. By crafting specific URL requests with directory traversal sequences (`/../`), an attacker can bypass access restrictions and read arbitrary files on the system. This can lead to information disclosure.
