- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A timing window exists that could allow for privilege escalation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Privilege escalation due to a timing window.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially gain higher privileges than intended.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is related to a timing window, which means that an attacker would need to exploit this during the specific time frame of vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be in a position to interact with the vulnerable part of WebSphere Application Server within the timing window.
