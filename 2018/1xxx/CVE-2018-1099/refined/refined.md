{
  "cve": "CVE-2018-1099",
  "description": "etcd 3.3.1 and earlier does not correctly restrict access to resources based on the hostname, thus allowing a DNS rebinding attack. An attacker can control his DNS records and trick the browser into sending requests to an etcd server on an internal network and bypassing the same-origin policy.",
  "affected_versions": [
    "etcd 3.3.1 and earlier"
  ],
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The etcd server does not properly validate the Host header of incoming HTTP requests, making it vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "DNS rebinding vulnerability",
      "Lack of proper Host header validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can perform a DNS rebinding attack to bypass the Same-Origin Policy and send requests to an etcd server on an internal network. This could allow the attacker to read or modify keys stored in etcd.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack involves setting up a malicious website that directs DNS records to the target's internal IP address where the etcd server is located. The victim's browser, after initially accessing the attacker's website, will then send requests to the internal etcd server as a result of the DNS rebinding.",
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control a domain name and DNS records and be able to create a malicious website. The victim has to visit the malicious website. Additionally, the target etcd server must be running without authentication on a network accessible to the attacker through DNS rebinding."
  },
   "mitigation": "Configure and enable authentication on the etcd server or secure your client connection via HTTPS. Additionally, use the `--host-whitelist` flag to specify acceptable hostnames from HTTP client requests. This will prevent the attack by only allowing requests from whitelisted domains."
