Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2018-1334:

**CVE-2018-1334: Apache Sparkâ„¢ local privilege escalation vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    *   The vulnerability stems from the possibility for a local user to connect to a Spark application and impersonate the user running the application.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Impersonation:** A different local user can connect and act as the user running the Spark application.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    * Local privilege escalation, where an attacker can gain the privileges of the user running the Spark application.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   A local user connects to a vulnerable Spark application.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Attacker needs to be a different local user on the same system where the vulnerable Spark application is running.

* **Affected Versions:**
    *   Spark versions through 2.1.2
    *   Spark 2.2.0 to 2.2.1
    *   Spark 2.3.0

* **Mitigation:**
    *   Upgrade to Spark 2.1.3 or newer for 1.x, 2.0.x, and 2.1.x users.
    *   Upgrade to Spark 2.2.2 or newer for 2.2.x users.
    *   Upgrade to Spark 2.3.1 or newer for 2.3.x users.
    *   Avoid using PySpark and SparkR in multi-user environments.

* **Additional Notes:**
    *   The vulnerability is specific to using PySpark or SparkR.
    *   The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute commands as a different local user.
