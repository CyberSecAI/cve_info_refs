# Security Bulletin: Multiple security vulnerabilities affect IBM WebSphere Application Server in IBM Cloud

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

There is a potential remote code execution vulnerability in WebSphere Application Server. There is a remote code execution vulnerability in the JSF Sun Reference Implementation 1.2 used by WebSphere Application Server. The JSF Sun Reference Implementation 1.2 is used as the default in WebSphere Application Server v7.0, other versions it is not the default. There is a potential spoofing attack in WebSphere Application Server using Form Login when using Java SE 6. This does not occur when using other versions of the Java SE. There is a potential for weaker than expected security in WebSphere Application Server which could result in TLS downgrade under certain conditions. This only applies if FIPS is enabled and the keystores/truststores are configured by the JVM property com.ibm.ssl.protocol. There are potential information disclosure vulnerabilities in WebSphere Application Server Liberty. WebSphere Application Server in IBM Cloud could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information caused by improper handling of passwords.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2018-1567](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1567)

**DESCRIPTION:** IBM WebSphere Application Server could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary Java code through the SOAP connector with a serialized object from untrusted sources.

CVSS Base Score: 9.8

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**CVEID:** [Not Applicable](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=Not)

**DESCRIPTION:** Apache MyFaces and Oracle Mojarra could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by improper configuration of ViewState settings. If ViewState is configured to use unencrypted state information, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute any code residing in the server's classpath.

**DESCRIPTION:** IBM WebSphere Application Server could provide weaker than expected security under certain conditions. This could result in a downgrade of TLS protocol. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform man-in-the-middle attacks.

CVSS Base Score: 5.9

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/147292> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2018-1755](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1755)

**DESCRIPTION:** WebSphere Application Server Liberty could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by incorrect transport being used when Liberty is configured to use Java Authentication SPI for Containers (JASPIC). This can happen when the Application Server is configured to permit access on non-secure (http) port and using JASPIC or JSR375 authentication.

CVSS Base Score: 5.9

B.  Log into the VM.

       1.  Run /opt/IBM/WebSphere/Liberty/bin/securityUtility encode <password> --encoding=aes

       2.  Copy the encoded password.

3.  Edit /etc/virtualimage.properties

       a.   Replace WAS\_PASSWORD={xor}oldvalue with WAS\_PASSWORD={aes}copied from above

        b.  Host: Replace WLP\_CONTROLLER\_PASS={xor}oldvalue with WLP\_CONTROLLER\_PASS={aes}copied from above

        c.  Controller: Replace WLP\_KEYSTORE\_PASS={xor}oldvalue with WLP\_KEYSTORE\_PASS={aes}copied from above

For the Controller and Server

       4.  Edit /opt/IBM/WebSphere/Profiles/Liberty/servers/server1/server.xml or /opt/IBM/WebSphere/Profiles/Liberty/servers/controller/server.xml

        a.  Replace userPassword="{xor}oldvalue" with userPassword="{aes}copied from above"

        b.  Controller: replace in a similar fashion passwords for defaultKeyStore, defaultTrustStore, serverIdentity, collectiveTrust, and collectiveRootKeys.
