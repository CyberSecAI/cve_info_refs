# Security Bulletin: This Power System update is being released to address CVE 2018-1992

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

POWER9: In response to a buffer overflow vulnerability on the boot loader, a new Power System firmware update is being released to address Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures issue number CVE 2018-1992.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2018-1992](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1992)
**DESCRIPTION:** The IBM POWER9 boot firmware's bootloader is responsible for loading and validating the initial boot firmware image that drives the rest of the system's hardware initialization. The bootloader firmware contains a buffer overflow vulnerability such that, if an attacker were able to replace the initial boot firmware image with a very carefully crafted and sufficiently large, malicious replacement, it could cause the bootloader, during the load of that image, to overwrite its own instruction memory and circumvent secure boot protections, install trojans, etc.  The firmware mitigation adds additional checking of the initial boot firmware image's load size and terminates the boot if the size is too big.

CVSS Base Score: 6.4

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/154345>
for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
