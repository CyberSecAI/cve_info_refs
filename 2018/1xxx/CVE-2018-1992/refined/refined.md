- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the IBM POWER9 boot firmware's bootloader. The bootloader is responsible for loading and validating the initial boot firmware image.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The bootloader firmware has a buffer overflow vulnerability which can be exploited if an attacker replaces the initial boot firmware image with a crafted, oversized malicious replacement.
- **Impact of exploitation:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can overwrite the bootloader's instruction memory, bypass secure boot protections, and potentially install trojans. This can lead to a complete compromise of the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by replacing the initial boot firmware image with a malicious, oversized replacement.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to replace the initial boot firmware image with a malicious one. This implies a high level of access to the system's firmware.
