- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input handling within the web interface of the IBM Security Access Manager Appliance.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before rendering it in the web UI.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web UI. This can lead to:
    - Altered intended functionality of the web UI.
    - Potential disclosure of credentials within a trusted user session.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs through embedding malicious JavaScript code within the web UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A low-privileged user account is required. The attacker also needs the victim user to interact with the malicious code.
