Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-1443:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)-based single sign-on (SSO) systems. The specific nature of the flaw is not detailed in the provided content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The primary weakness lies within the SAML-based SSO implementation of the affected products. The nature of the vulnerability is not described.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The documents don't specify the exact impact, however, it does specify that it is a security vulnerability in a SAML SSO implementation, meaning that exploitation could potentially lead to unauthorized access, impersonation, or other security breaches related to authentication and authorization.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector would involve exploiting the vulnerability in the SAML-based SSO system. This would likely involve crafting or manipulating SAML requests or responses in a way that bypasses security checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

An attacker would need to be able to interact with the SAML SSO system, meaning they would likely need to be able to send/receive SAML messages. This might involve an attacker being able to intercept or manipulate SAML messages between the application and an identity provider, or impersonating a user.
