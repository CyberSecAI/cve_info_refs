- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the web UI, allowing users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to alter the intended functionality of the web UI, potentially leading to credential disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by embedding malicious JavaScript code within the web UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to interact with the web UI to inject malicious JavaScript code. The attacker must have a valid user account with the ability to interact with affected fields.
