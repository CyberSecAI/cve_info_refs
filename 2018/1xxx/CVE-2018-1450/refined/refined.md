Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-1450:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is not explicitly stated, but the vulnerability stems from a flaw within IBM DB2 that allows a local user to overwrite arbitrary files owned by the DB2 instance owner.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- File overwrite vulnerability: An unprivileged local user can overwrite arbitrary files owned by the DB2 instance owner.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Integrity Impact (High):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the system. This could lead to corruption of database files, configuration files, or even system files, potentially causing significant disruptions or complete data loss.
- **Availability Impact (High):** Overwriting critical files could render the database unusable or lead to system crashes, severely impacting the availability of the DB2 system.
- **Confidentiality Impact (None):** The vulnerability does not directly expose any sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access: The attacker must have local access to the system where the vulnerable DB2 instance is running.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user on the system where the affected DB2 instance is running. The attacker does not require any elevated privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
