Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1155:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation within the Reports feature of Tenable SecurityCenter. Specifically, the image filename parameter was not adequately sanitized, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The core vulnerability is a reflected XSS flaw, where the injected JavaScript code is executed within the context of the victim's browser when they interact with the vulnerable report.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser when viewing a report. This could lead to:
*   **Data theft:** Stealing sensitive information like session cookies or login credentials.
*   **Account takeover:** By injecting malicious code to perform actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Malware distribution:** Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
*   **Defacement:** Altering the appearance of the web page.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack is carried out by injecting malicious JavaScript code into the image filename parameter within the Reports feature. This would likely involve crafting a malicious URL or report that contains the payload and then tricking a legitimate user into accessing that resource.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of Tenable SecurityCenter to access the Reports feature and inject the malicious code.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker requires a user to interact with a malicious report containing the XSS payload to trigger the vulnerability

**Additional Notes**
* The vulnerability was addressed in Tenable Security Center version 5.7.0 by implementing proper input validation techniques.
* The CVSS v2 score is 3.5, while CVSS v3 score is 5.4. This indicates a medium severity.
