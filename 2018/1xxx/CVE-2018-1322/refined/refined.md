Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1322:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient filtering and sanitization of user-supplied input when using the `fiql` and `orderby` parameters in the `/syncope/rest/users` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The application does not properly prevent sensitive data from being exposed when filtering or sorting user data. Specifically, the `fiql` parameter allows filtering based on user attributes, including security answers, and the `orderby` parameter allows sorting based on attributes like security answers and password hashes.
- **Insecure Filtering:** The use of `fiql` allows an attacker to recover security answers character by character by iteratively filtering results.
- **Insecure Sorting:** The `orderby` parameter can be exploited to reveal information about security answers and partial password hashes by observing the sort order of results.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Attackers can recover full security answers and partial information about password hashes. This compromises the confidentiality of user data and could enable further attacks such as password resets or account takeovers.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Parameters:** Exploitation involves crafting malicious requests to the `/syncope/rest/users` endpoint, using `fiql` and `orderby` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User Search Entitlements:** The attacker needs to have sufficient privileges to access the `/syncope/rest/users` endpoint. Specifically, the user needs to have "user search entitlements".

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Apache Syncope versions prior to 1.2.11 and 2.0.8.
*   The advisory suggests that unsupported releases 1.0.x and 1.1.x may also be affected.
*   Mitigation involves not assigning user search entitlements to untrusted administrators.
