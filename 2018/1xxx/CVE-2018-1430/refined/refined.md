- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization, allowing users to inject malicious JavaScript code into the Web UI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can embed arbitrary JavaScript code, potentially leading to alteration of the intended functionality and disclosure of credentials within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the Web UI of IBM API Connect, where a user can inject malicious JavaScript.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a user who can interact with the Web UI, which implies the user needs to have a valid account with the permission to input data that can be exploited to inject malicious code. This user needs to have the capability to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI which could be achieved through an input field or some other vulnerable feature.
