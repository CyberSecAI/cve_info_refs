{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) defaults to an insecure configuration in Linux's keepalived component, which sends the cluster password in plaintext through multicast.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Information exposure vulnerability due to the transmission of the cluster password in plaintext.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious user could sniff the password and use it to take over the cluster's virtual IP, causing a denial of service (DoS) on the affected ViPR Controller system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the vCloud subnet where ViPR is deployed.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have access to the vCloud subnet where the ViPR Controller is deployed and be able to sniff network traffic."
