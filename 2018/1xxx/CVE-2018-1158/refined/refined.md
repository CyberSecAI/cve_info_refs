Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1158:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a stack exhaustion issue within the `www` binary of MikroTik RouterOS. This is caused by the recursive parsing of JSON data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack Exhaustion:** The recursive nature of the JSON parsing process consumes stack memory.
- **Improper Input Handling:** The system fails to properly limit or handle the depth of the recursive JSON structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to the crash of the HTTP server, rendering it unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attack is carried out over the network.
- **HTTP Protocol:** The vulnerability is exploited via the HTTP protocol, specifically by interacting with the `www` binary.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must have valid credentials to authenticate to the RouterOS device's HTTP server.
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network access to the targeted RouterOS device.
- **Ability to Send Crafted JSON:** The attacker must be capable of crafting and sending a malicious JSON message with a specific type, `M`, to trigger the recursive parsing.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Mikrotik RouterOS versions before 6.42.7 and 6.40.9.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) involves crafting a JSON message with nested "M" type entries.
- A provided Python script demonstrates how to generate the malicious JSON message.
