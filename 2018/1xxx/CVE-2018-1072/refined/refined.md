{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `ovirt-engine-provisiondb` utility, which is called by `engine-backup` when invoked with the `--provision*db` options, logs the database username and password in cleartext.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The database password is not being filtered or masked before being written to the log file."
    ],
    "impact": "Sharing the provisioning log might inadvertently leak database passwords.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker who has access to the engine-backup log file can obtain the database username and password if engine-backup was run with one of the options `--provision*db`."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs access to the log files generated by the `engine-backup` utility.",
     "additional_information": "The vulnerability exists because the database credentials are not being properly filtered in the log file when database provisioning occurs as a part of backup using the `engine-backup` utility. The database credentials include both the username and password."
