- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Buffer overflow vulnerability
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Buffer overflow that can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an authenticated local attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system with root privileges, leading to privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated local user.
