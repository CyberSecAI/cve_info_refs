  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2018-1080",
    "description": "Dogtag PKI through version 10.5.1 has a vulnerability in AAclAuthz.java that, under certain configuration, causes the application of ACL allow and deny rules to be reversed. If a server is configured to process allow rules before deny rules (authz.evaluateOrder=allow,deny), then allow rules will deny access and deny rules will grant access.",
    "affected_components": [
      "pki-core"
    ],
    "root_cause": "Mishandled ACL configuration in AAclAuthz.java",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect application of ACL rules"
    ],
    "impact": "Escalation of privileges or other unintended consequences due to incorrect access control.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Configuration of server to process allow rules before deny rules (authz.evaluateOrder=allow,deny)."
    ],
   "required_capabilities": "Requires the ability to configure the server's ACL processing order, specifically setting `authz.evaluateOrder` to `allow,deny`."
