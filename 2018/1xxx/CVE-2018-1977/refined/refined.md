- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A specially-crafted SQL statement using the TRUNCATE scalar functions could lead to a denial of service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of specific SQL statements with TRUNCATE scalar functions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit leads to a DB2 server crash, requiring a restart of the server. This results in a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote, authenticated DB2 user can execute the malicious SQL statement.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An authenticated DB2 user with the ability to execute SQL statements. The attack is specific to IBM DB2 on Linux System z platform.
