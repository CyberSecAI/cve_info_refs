- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the fact that authenticated users can add HTML blocks containing scripts to their personal Dashboard. While this is typically not an issue because the dashboard is only visible to the user, a flaw allows users to move these blocks to other pages where they can be viewed by other users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The core vulnerability is the ability to move user-created blocks containing scripts from a personal context to a shared context, essentially a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability through block manipulation. The vulnerability is due to insufficient access control and inadequate sanitization/escaping of user-provided HTML content.
- **Impact of exploitation:** By exploiting this vulnerability, a malicious user could inject arbitrary scripts into pages that are visible to other users. This could lead to a variety of malicious activities such as session hijacking, phishing, defacement of the site, and potentially other forms of unauthorized access and information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves an authenticated user creating a malicious HTML block with embedded scripts in their personal Dashboard, and then using the block manipulation feature to move that block to a page visible by other users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to create and manage blocks on their dashboard. The attacker also needs to have the 'moodle/my:manageblocks' capability.
