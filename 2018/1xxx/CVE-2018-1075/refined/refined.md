Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1075:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from unfiltered logging of database passwords during the `engine-setup` process in oVirt Engine. Specifically, when a user chooses to manually provision the database or connect to a remote database, the entered password is logged in cleartext before being filtered. This occurs during the verification step of the database setup.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Logging:** The primary vulnerability is the logging of sensitive database credentials in plain text before the filtering mechanism is applied. This exposes the password to anyone who has access to the logs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker gaining access to the provisioning logs could obtain the database password. This would enable the attacker to compromise the database and potentially the entire oVirt environment.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Log File Access:** The attack vector involves an unauthorized individual gaining access to the `engine-setup` log files.
- **Manual Database Provisioning/Remote Database Connection:** The vulnerability is specifically triggered when a user opts for manual database setup or when connecting to a remote database during the `engine-setup` process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Server Logs:** The attacker needs some level of access to the server where the `engine-setup` was performed, specifically to the logs generated during the setup process. This could be achieved through various means, such as compromising the server or exploiting an existing access control issue.
- **Knowledge of Setup Process:** While not strictly required, knowledge of the setup process would help the attacker pinpoint the location and type of logs to search.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability was addressed in Red Hat Virtualization Engine 4.2 via RHSA-2018:2071
* The fix involves filtering the password before logging it.
* This issue was discovered by Yedidyah Bar David (Red Hat).
* The official description is a bit vague but the provided content offers more detail.
