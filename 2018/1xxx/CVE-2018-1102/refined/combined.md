# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Topic

An update for source-to-image is now available for Red Hat Software Collections.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Source-to-Image (S2I) is a tool for building reproducible container images. It produces ready-to-run images by injecting a user source into a container image and assembling a new container image. The new image incorporates the base image (the builder) and built source, and is ready to use with the "docker run" command. S2I supports incremental builds, which re-use previously downloaded dependencies, previously built artifacts, and more.

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: source-to-image (1.1.13). (BZ#1654243)

Security Fix(es):

* source-to-image: Improper path sanitization in ExtractTarStreamFromTarReader in tar/tar.go (CVE-2018-1102)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Michael Hanselmann (hansmi.ch) for reporting this issue.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1562246#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2018-03-29 21:19:33 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in source-to-image as shipped with Openshift Enterprise 3.6. A improper path validation of tar files in ExtractTarStreamFromTarReader in tar/tar.go leads to privilege escalation.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1562246#c6)  Jason Shepherd    2018-04-05 01:18:29 UTC  ``` The source-to-image (S2I/STI) builder in OpenShift 3.4-3.9 contains a vulnerability allowing an attacker to gain root access on the host system. The underlying cause is comparable to an issue in Kubernetes' kubectl (and "oc") which was reported publicly on the 25th March 2018 [1].   [1] <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/61297>  OpenShift contains similar code as part of its S2I module, specifically in "openshift/source-to-image/pkg/tar/tar.go:ExtractTarStreamFromTarReader". Paths from a tar archive are used as input to "filepath.Join" without further sanitation. "ExtractTarStreamFromTarReader" is also used on the client side by "oc rsync". S2I uses the code to unpack artifacts in its main container.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1562246#c11)  Trevor Jay    2018-04-05 10:55:41 UTC  ``` Some observations:  *Flaw is not in the GO tar implementation but is in the failure to restrict the execution context. The writing is done by a process with inflated privileges. S2I in general has too many privileges for a service that processes Turing complete user input. * Major area of concern is within S2I, but other affected areas are known to exist.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1562246#c13)  Jason Shepherd    2018-04-06 00:00:11 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Michael Hanselmann (hansmi.ch)   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=1562246#c31)  Kurt Seifried    2018-04-27 18:20:55 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/3422241>   ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=1562246#c33)  Kurt Seifried    2018-04-27 20:07:50 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Customers can turn off the source-to-image (S2I) build strategy to prevent access to the exploitable function.  Information about how to disable the source-to-image build strategy is in the product documentation.  * Disabling S2I in OpenShift Enterprise 3.0 - <https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/admin_guide/securing_builds.html#disabling-a-build-strategy-globally> * Disabling S2I in OpenShift Enterprise 3.1 -

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1563317#c0)  Hemant Kumar    2018-04-03 15:19:37 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1558564](show_bug.cgi?id=1558564 "CLOSED ERRATA - Mounting socket files from subPaths fail") +++  Description of problem:  Mounting sockets or special files from subpaths fails.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): 3.9.x  How reproducible:  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create a pod definition that uses "/" as hostPath. 2. Try and mount something like "/run/docker.sock" as a subpath within a container. 3. The pod will fail to start  The reason of this regression is - openat system call being used on <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/util/mount/mount_linux.go#L1138> does not work for special files like Unix sockets and it will throw - Errno::ENXIO: No such device or address /run/docker.sock   Actual results:  The pod fails to start   Expected results: The pod should start  --- Additional comment from Hemant Kumar on 2018-03-20 10:34:25 EDT ---  For now, while we make the fix. One possible workaround is to directly mount "/run/docker.sock" via a new volume entry and a new VolumeMounts entry that does not uses subpath.  Something like:  VolumeMounts: [ { mountPath: "/run/docker.sock", name: docker_sock, readOnly: true} ], volumes: [ { name: docker_sock, hostPath: { path: "/run/docker.sock", type: "" }, ]  --- Additional comment from Hemant Kumar on 2018-03-22 16:41:08 EDT ---  PR upstream for the fix <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61480>  --- Additional comment from Hemant Kumar on 2018-03-26 11:30:50 EDT ---  Opened PR for Openshift/origin - <https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/19100>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1563317#c6)  Liang Xia    2018-04-20 07:43:32 UTC  ``` # oc version oc v3.6.173.0.113 kubernetes v1.6.1+5115d708d7 features: Basic-Auth GSSAPI Kerberos SPNEGO  Server <https://qe-lxia-36-master-nfs-1:8443> openshift v3.6.173.0.113 kubernetes v1.6.1+5115d708d7   # cat /etc/redhat-release  Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 7.3 (Maipo)   # uname -a Linux qe-lxia-36-master-nfs-1 3.10.0-514.26.1.el7.x86_64 #1 SMP Tue Jun 20 01:16:02 EDT 2017 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux   First try to mount /run/docker.sock to /, the pod failed to start,  9s		8s		2	kubelet, qe-lxia-36-node-registry-router-1	spec.containers{test-container}	Warning		Failed		Error: Error response from daemon: {"message":"Invalid bind mount spec \"/run/docker.sock:/\": Invalid specification: destination can't be '/' in '/run/docker.sock:/'"}  Then change mount point to /mnt, the pod is up and runing, $ oc get pods testpd NAME      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE testpd    1/1       Running   0          24s   $ cat pod.yaml apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata:   name: testpd spec:   containers:   - image: k8s.gcr.io/test-webserver     name: test-container     volumeMounts:     - mountPath: /mnt       name: test-volume       subpath: mysock   volumes:   - name: test-volume     hostPath:       path: /run/docker.sock       type: ""   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1563317#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-04-30 04:00:18 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A1235)

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.5.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Critical. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is the company's cloud computing Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution designed for on-premise or private cloud deployments.

This advisory contains RPM packages for this release. See the following advisory for the container images for this release:

[https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2018:1234](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2018%3A1234)

Security Fix(es):

* source-to-image: Improper path sanitization in ExtractTarStreamFromTarReader in tar/tar.go (CVE-2018-1102)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Image validation used to validate old image objects, and an invalid image could be pushed to etcd. With this bug fix, validation has been changed to validate new image objects, and as a result it is no longer possible to upload an invalid image object. (BZ#1559991)
* A panic could occur due to concurrent writes to cache. This bug fix protects writes to the cache with mutex. As a result, the cache is safe to use concurrently. (BZ#1549902)
* Fluentd fails to properly process messages when it is unable to determine the namespace and pod UUIDs. The logging pipeline produces many messages and sometimes blocks log flow to Elasticsearch. This bug fix checks for the missing fields and sets the record as orphaned, if needed. As a result, logs now continue to flow and orphaned records end up in an orphaned namespace. (BZ#1520629)
* The "Add Donut char to Dashboard" button is always visible, even when the application does not include a dashboard, and click on the button does not do anything. This bug fix removes the button, as a result the the feature is not available, as it should be. (BZ#1551503)

This update also adds the following enhancement:

* An `.operations` index-mapping in a non-ops Elasticsearch cluster is no longer displayed because operations indices will never exist in a non-ops Elasticsearch cluster. (BZ#1519709)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A1231)

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Critical. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is the company's cloud computing Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution designed for on-premise or private cloud deployments.

This advisory contains RPM packages for this release. See the following advisory for the container images for this release:

[https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2018:1230](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2018%3A1230)

Security Fix(es):

* source-to-image: Improper path sanitization in ExtractTarStreamFromTarReader in tar/tar.go (CVE-2018-1102)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Fluentd inserts documents (logs) into Elasticsearch using the bulk insert API, but relies upon Elasticsearch to generate UUIDs for each document. It does not remove successfully indexed documents from the bulk payload when the bulk operation fails. This caused the initial payload to be resubmitted and documents that were successfully indexed to be submitted again, which results in duplicate documents with different UUIDs. This bug fix ensures that document IDs are generated before submitting bulk insert requests. As a result, Elasticsearch will disregard the insertion of documents that already exist in the data store and insert documents that do not. (BZ#1556896)
* A user can set a host name to `localhost`, which confuses the router check to see if the reload completed. This caused the reload to never return success, causing the router to fail. This bug fix changes the health check so that it does not pass the host name `localhost`. As a result, routers can now reload successfully. (BZ#1548102)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1450131#c0)  Andrew Slice    2017-05-11 15:30:12 UTC  ``` The official RPMs are at version 1.0.9. A feature that allows for building a container from one image and running it on a different image (--runtime-image) was implemented in 1.1.0.  We'd like to use this feature in the s2i-dotnetcore project, so can we get an update to the official RPMs?   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1450131#c4)  Petr Kubat    2017-11-21 08:56:19 UTC  ``` Source-to-image has been rebased to version 1.1.7 in Fedora so we can now look into getting it into rhel as well.  <http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/rpms/source-to-image/c/ae25f20dbddda15008b6d8910b932f8edc279488?branch=master>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1450131#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-01-08 13:44:43 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.  For information on the advisory, and where to find the updated files, follow the link below.  If the solution does not work for you, open a new bug report.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1562966#c0)  emahoney    2018-04-02 19:33:24 UTC  ``` Description of problem: A fresh installation of OCP 3.7 on AWS fails with the error message below:      "msg": "file not found: /etc/origin/logging/ca.crl.srl"  After the failed deploy, we noted that the ca.crl.srl file does not exist (there is a ca.crt.srl though!). After doing a 'touch ca.crl.srl' in that directory and re-running the playbook, the install is successful. We also noted that the variable 'openshift_master_overwrite_named_certificates=true' was not set in the inventory. Although that might be a red-herring.    Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): 3.7 latest   How reproducible: Have not been able to reproduce.   Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.  Actual results: Install fails with "msg": "file not found: /etc/origin/logging/ca.crl.srl"   Expected results: Successful install   Additional info:   Description of problem:  Version-Release number of the following components: rpm -q openshift-ansible rpm -q ansible ansible --version  How reproducible:  Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.  Actual results: Please include the entire output from the last TASK line through the end of output if an error is generated  Expected results:  Additional info: Please attach logs from ansible-playbook with the -vvv flag   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1562966#c5)  Rich Megginson    2018-04-03 15:25:15 UTC  ``` @sdodson why was this moved from Installer to Logging?  It is definitely a problem in openshift-ansible (in the logging role).   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1562966#c6)  Scott Dodson    2018-04-03 15:49:17 UTC  ``` I thought that's what we were to do for logging issue. I can leave it in component installer and assign to Eric for triage if that'd preferable.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1562966#c7)  Rich Megginson    2018-04-03 15:51:42 UTC  ``` (In reply to Scott Dodson from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1562966#c6)) > I thought that's what we were to do for logging issue. I can leave it in > component installer and assign to Eric for triage if that'd preferable.  Yeah - it is confusing - the _team_ working on it will be the logging team, but the _component_ containing the released fix will be openshift-ansible - I don't think the bz Component captures that.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1562966#c9)  Jeff Cantrill    2018-04-04 19:43:46 UTC  ``` Maybe not related but shouldn't we be advising users of openshift-ansible to use a specific version of ansible.  I don't recall 2.4.x.y being available when we released openshift-ansible for 3.7   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1562966#c10)  Scott Dodson    2018-04-05 12:28:54 UTC  ``` Jeff,  Yes, we advise that they use the version that ships in our channels, but ansible ended up in the RHEL 7 extras repo temporarily so it became likely that we'd get 2.4 unless the admin deliberately ensures that won't happen.   <https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/pull/7764> proposed fix from the community   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1562966#c11)  ewolinet    2018-04-05 16:33:46 UTC  ``` 3.7 cherrypick <https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/pull/7815>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1562966#c12)  raffaele spazzoli    2018-04-09 13:08:48 UTC  ``` I am seeing the same issue with a fresh 3.9 install. I suggest the affected release to be updated to 3.9 too. This seems to be blocking. is there a workaround?   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1562966#c13)  ewolinet    2018-04-09 14:13:10 UTC  ``` @raffaele This was the 3.9 cherry pick <https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/pull/7814>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1562966#c15)  Anping Li    2018-04-20 02:17:41 UTC  ``` The /etc/origin/logging/ca.crl.srl can be found when deploy logging with openshift3/ose-ansible/images/v3.7.44-3   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1562966#c20)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-04-29 14:36:36 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Critical. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is the company's cloud computing Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution designed for on-premise or private cloud deployments.

This advisory contains RPM packages for this release. See the following advisory for the container images for this release:

[https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2018:1232](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2018%3A1232)

Security Fix(es):

* source-to-image: Improper path sanitization in ExtractTarStreamFromTarReader in tar/tar.go (CVE-2018-1102)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Image validation used to validate old image objects, and an invalid image could be pushed to etcd. With this bug fix, validation has been changed to validate new image objects, and as a result it is no longer possible to upload an invalid image object. (BZ#1559982)
* A panic could occur due to concurrent writes to cache. This bug fix protects writes to the cache with mutex. As a result, the cache is safe to use concurrently. (BZ#1549916)
