- **Root cause of vulnerability**: IBM GSKit contains several environment variables that a local attacker could overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow vulnerability in environment variables.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker can cause a denial of service by overflowing environment variables.
- **Attack vectors**: A local attacker can overflow environment variables.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
