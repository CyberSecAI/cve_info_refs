# Security Bulletin: Cross-site scripting vulnerability in CacheMonitor for WebSphere Application Server (CVE-2018-1767)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

There is a potential cross-site scripting vulnerability in the Cache Monitor web application in WebSphere Application Server.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2018-1767](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1767)

## Affected Products and Versions

This vulnerability affects the following versions and releases of IBM WebSphere Application Server:

* Liberty
* Version 9.0
* Version 8.5
* Version 8.0
* Version 7.0

## Remediation/Fixes

The recommended solution is to apply the interim fix, Fix Pack or PTF containing the APARs for each named product as soon as practical.

**For WebSphere Application Server Liberty:**

**NOTE: If you apply the ifix, then there are additional steps needed see below**

**For Liberty:**

· Upgrade to minimal fix pack levels as required by interim fix and then apply Interim Fix  [PH02049](https://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=ibm10736089)

--OR--

· Apply Fix Pack 18.0.0.4 or later.

**For WebSphere Application Server traditional and WebSphere Application Server Hypervisor Edition:**

**NOTE: If you apply the ifix, then there are additional steps needed see below**

**For V9.0.0.0 through 9.0.0.9:**

· Upgrade to minimal fix pack levels as required by interim fix and then apply Interim Fix  [PH02049](https://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=ibm10736089)

--OR--

· Apply Fix Pack 9.0.0.10 or later.

**For V8.5.0.0 through 8.5.5.14:**

· Upgrade to minimal fix pack levels as required by interim fix and then apply Interim Fix [PH02049](https://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=ibm10736089)

--OR--

· Apply Fix Pack 8.5.5.15 or later.

**For V8.0.0.0 through 8.0.0.15:**

· Upgrade v8.0.0.15 and then apply Interim Fix [PH02049](https://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=ibm10736089)

**For V7.0.0.0 through 7.0.0.45:**

· Upgrade to v7.0.0.45 and then apply Interim Fix [PH02049](https://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=ibm10736089)

*WebSphere Application Server V7 and V8 are no longer in full support; IBM recommends upgrading to a fixed, supported version/release/platform of the product.*

**ADDITIONAL STEPS AFTER APPLYING INTERIM FIX:**

The interim fix only applies the fix to the CacheMonitor.ear in the installableApps directory.  Additional, manual steps are necessary to apply the fix to the cache monitor that is installed on an application server.  These steps are not necessary if the fix pack was installed.

Use wsadmin to execute the following command for each profile where the cache monitor is installed:

AdminApp.update('Dynamic Cache Monitor', 'file', '[-operation update -contents

\'${profilePath}/installedApps/${cellName}/Dynamic Cache Monitor.ear/CacheMonitor.war/ESIContents.jsp\' -contenturi CacheMonitor.war/ESIContents.jsp]')

Substitute ${profilePath} and ${cellName} with applicable

values for your environment.

```

```
