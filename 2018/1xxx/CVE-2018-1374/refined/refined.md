- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A client connecting to an IBM MQ or IBM WebSphere MQ Queue Manager could trigger a SIGSEGV (segmentation fault) in the channel process amqrmppa.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the channel process amqrmppa, which is susceptible to a segmentation fault.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a crash of the amqrmppa channel process, potentially disrupting MQ services.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious client connecting to the IBM MQ or WebSphere MQ Queue Manager.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to establish a connection to the affected IBM MQ or WebSphere MQ Queue Manager as a client.
