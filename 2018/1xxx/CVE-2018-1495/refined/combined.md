# Security Bulletin: A vulnerability affects the IBM FlashSystem models 840 and 900

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

There is a vulnerability which the IBM FlashSystem™ 840 and FlashSystem 900 are susceptible. An exploit of this vulnerability (CVE-2018-1495) could make the system susceptible to an attack which could allow an attacker to overwrite arbitrary files.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2018-1495](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1495) IBM FlashSystem products could allow an authenticated attacker with specialized access to overwrite arbitrary files which could cause a denial of service.

CVSS Base Score: 6.5

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/141148> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

## Affected Products and Versions

FlashSystem 840 machine type and models (MTMs) affected include 9840-AE1 and 9843-AE1.

FlashSystem 900 MTMs affected include 9840-AE2 and 9843-AE2.

Supported code versions which are affected

* VRMFs prior to 1.3.0.10
* VRMFs prior to 1.4.8.0
* VRMFs prior to 1.5.1.1

## Workarounds and Mitigations

Customers running the 1.3 code version should be aware that 1.3.0.10 is the last planned release for the 1.3 code stream and that it will no longer be supported from a security fix point of view going forward. These customers should consider upgrading to either 1.4.8.0 or 1.5.1.1 to pick up these security fixes in these newer code streams which will continue to be supported.
