  "CVE-2018-1059": {
    "description": "The DPDK vhost-user interface does not check to verify that all the requested guest physical range is mapped and contiguous when performing Guest Physical Addresses to Host Virtual Addresses translations. This may lead to a malicious guest exposing vhost-user backend process memory.",
    "root_cause": "Incorrect bounds checking in the DPDK vhost-user interface when translating guest physical addresses to host virtual addresses.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Information exposure vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious guest could potentially access sensitive information by exposing vhost-user backend process memory.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploitation of the flawed address translation mechanism in the vhost-user interface"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Requires a malicious guest OS running with the ability to use the DPDK vhost-user interface."
