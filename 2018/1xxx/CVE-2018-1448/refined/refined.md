- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A vulnerability exists in IBM Db2 that could allow a local user to overwrite Db2 files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows for unauthorized file overwriting by a local user.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow a local user to gain elevated privileges and overwrite critical Db2 files potentially leading to a compromise of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local access to the vulnerable Db2 installation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a local user with access to the Db2 system.
