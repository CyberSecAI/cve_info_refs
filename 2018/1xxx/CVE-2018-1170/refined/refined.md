- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of a proper protection mechanism against unauthorized firmware updates in the Volkswagen Customer-Link App and Customer-Link Bridge.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application doesn't properly protect against unauthorized firmware updates, which allows for the injection of arbitrary Controller Area Network (CAN) messages.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary CAN messages. The provided CVSS score indicates a high impact across all dimensions: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
- **Attack vectors**: Adjacent network access is required. Specifically, the vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker on the same network segment as the vulnerable device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker must be adjacent to the vulnerable device on the network. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
