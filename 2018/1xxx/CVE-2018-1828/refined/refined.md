- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI. This is due to insufficient input validation or output encoding of user-supplied data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation can allow attackers to alter the intended functionality of the application, potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session. This may include session hijacking, stealing sensitive data, or performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user, likely an authenticated one with the ability to modify content, injects malicious JavaScript code into the web UI. The malicious code executes when other users view the compromised page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A user needs to have the ability to inject JavaScript into the application's web UI. This likely requires the user to have some sort of access to modify or create content within the application. The attacker would need to entice other users to interact with the malicious content.
