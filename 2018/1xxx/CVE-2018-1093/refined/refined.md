  "CVE-2018-1093": {
    "description": "The Linux kernel through version 4.15 is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read in ext4/balloc.c:ext4_valid_block_bitmap() function. An privileged attacker could exploit this by mounting a crafted ext4 image to cause a crash.",
    "root_cause": "Out-of-bounds read in `ext4_valid_block_bitmap` due to a missing boundary check on `BIT_WORD(nr)` which causes out-of-bound access on the bitmap block data.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (system crash). A privileged attacker or a user tricked into mounting a crafted ext4 image can trigger the vulnerability leading to a kernel crash.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Mounting a crafted ext4 filesystem image"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Local user able to mount arbitrary filesystems, or an attacker tricking a user to mount a malicious filesystem image.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs during the mounting of the crafted ext4 image or during operations on the mounted file system. The vulnerability lies in the `ext4_valid_block_bitmap` function which does not validate the offset before accessing the bitmap data."
