- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Db2's Row and Column Access Control (RCAC) rules are not enforced when creating a table using AS (CTAS) sub-select statements with the 'WITH DATA' clause, where data is selected and inserted into the new table.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Failure to enforce RCAC rules during CTAS operations, leading to potential unauthorized data access.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A user could bypass FGAC (Fine Grained Access Control) and gain access to data they should not be able to see, which could result in information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs by creating a table using a CTAS sub-select statement with the 'WITH DATA' clause.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to create tables, and the vulnerability requires a user to perform the specific operation. The user also must have lower privileges in terms of data access, but they are still able to create tables.
