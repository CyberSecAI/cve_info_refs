- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue found in IBM Rational DOORS Next Generation. The specific cause is not detailed in this document, but it implies that user-supplied input is not being properly sanitized or encoded before being included in web pages, allowing for the execution of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web application. This could lead to various impacts, including session hijacking, defacement of the website, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the web application interface, where an attacker can inject malicious scripts into fields or parameters that are not properly sanitized by the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have the ability to insert malicious input into fields or parameters within the affected application.
