- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper output encoding in a CSV export.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The application does not properly encode data when generating a CSV file. This allows for the injection of malicious code or commands within the CSV file itself.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can achieve remote code execution on the victim's machine. By crafting a malicious CSV file, an attacker can execute any command or program.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker must persuade the victim to download the malicious CSV export, open it using Microsoft Excel, and confirm the two security dialogs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker can be remote and needs to be able to influence a victim into downloading and opening the malicious CSV. The attacker would also need knowledge of the vulnerable software's CSV export feature and how to inject malicious code into it. The vulnerability requires user interaction (opening the file and clicking through prompts).
