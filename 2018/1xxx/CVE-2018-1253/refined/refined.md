The provided content is related to CVE-2018-1253.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in the RSA Authentication Manager Operation Console.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding within the RSA Authentication Manager Operation Console's web interface. This allows a malicious administrator to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code that gets stored and later executed when other administrators view the affected page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow a malicious Operations Console administrator to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browsers of other Operations Console administrators who view the affected page. This could lead to various malicious activities such as: session hijacking, data theft, defacement, and redirection to malicious sites.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the web interface of the RSA Authentication Manager Operation Console. A malicious administrator can inject malicious code by entering it into an input field that does not sanitize the data properly.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be a malicious Operations Console administrator to exploit this vulnerability by injecting the malicious code. They must also be able to access the vulnerable web interface.
