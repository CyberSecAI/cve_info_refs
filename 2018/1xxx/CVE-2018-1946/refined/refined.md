  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The IBM Security Identity Governance Virtual Appliance allows multiple actors to negotiate protection algorithms (encryption or authentication) but does not select the strongest available option.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of weaker cryptographic algorithms when stronger ones are available."
    ],
    "impact": "Potential compromise of confidentiality due to the use of weaker than necessary algorithms for encryption or authentication. Could enable an attacker to eavesdrop, forge communications, or bypass authentication mechanisms.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attacks. An attacker could intercept or manipulate communications between the actors of the system."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack or similar network-based attacks to intercept and potentially manipulate the negotiated connection."
