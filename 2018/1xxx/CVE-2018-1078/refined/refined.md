Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1078:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an insecure behavior in the node reconciliation process within OpenDaylight. Specifically, during reconnection, all flows, including both active and inactive ones, present in the configuration datastore are reinstalled on the switch.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Node Reconciliation:** The process of restoring flows upon reconnection does not discriminate between necessary and unnecessary flows. This leads to the reinstallation of all flows, irrespective of their validity or current relevance.
- **Lack of Flow Management:** The system appears to lack a mechanism to manage or filter flows effectively during reconciliation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS) via Table Overflow:** The reinstallation of all flows, including potentially expired or redundant ones, can cause the switch's flow table to overflow. This results in a denial of service by exhausting the switch's resources.
- **Circumventing Controller's Control:** The re-installation of inactive or old flows can lead to the switch operating outside the intended control of the controller, potentially creating unexpected network behaviors and security gaps.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Disconnection/Reconnection:** An attacker could induce network disconnections or reconnections to trigger the vulnerable reconciliation process, causing the described impacts.
- **Manipulating the Config Datastore:** An attacker could potentially manipulate the config datastore to include malicious or excessive flows, exacerbating the impact during reconciliation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs access to the network where OpenDaylight is deployed, with the ability to cause reconnections between the controller and the switches.
- **Potential Control Plane Access:** If an attacker can manipulate the configuration datastore, the attack could be escalated.

**Additional Details:**
- The bug was acknowledged by a security researcher and reported in January 2018.
- The upstream issue is tracked in the OpenDaylight Jira as OPNFLWPLUG-971.
- Red Hat considers this bug as "CLOSED WONTFIX" as OpenDaylight was deprecated in OpenStack 14 and no upstream resolution is available.
- A duplicate bug report is also available as bug 1555473.
- This vulnerability is specific to OpenDaylight and its handling of flows during reconnection events.
