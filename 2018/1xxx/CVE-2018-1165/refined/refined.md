      "status": "relevant",
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length, heap-based buffer within the SMB_IOC_SVCENUM IOCTL.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Heap-based buffer overflow",
          "Insufficient input validation"

        "impact": "Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to execute code under the context of the host OS, resulting in privilege escalation.",
        "attack_vector": "A local attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system to exploit the vulnerability via the SMB_IOC_SVCENUM IOCTL.",
        "required_capabilities": "Ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system."
