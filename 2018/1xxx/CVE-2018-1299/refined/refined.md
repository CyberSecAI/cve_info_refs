Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2018-1299:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a directory traversal issue within the `StaticFilesMiddleware` component of Apache Allura.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Directory Traversal: The `StaticFilesMiddleware` does not properly sanitize or validate file paths, allowing an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary File Retrieval: Unauthenticated attackers can retrieve arbitrary files from the server hosting the Allura web application. This could potentially expose sensitive configuration files, source code, or user data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP Requests: Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious HTTP requests containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) in the file path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Unauthenticated access to the Allura web application.
- Ability to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the Allura web application.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in Apache Allura versions 1.7.0 and earlier.
- Some web servers (e.g., Nginx, Apache/mod_wsgi, paster) may prevent this vulnerability from being exploited, while others (e.g., gunicorn) do not, leaving Allura vulnerable.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Everardo Padilla Saca.
- The fix is to upgrade to Apache Allura 1.8.0 or later.
