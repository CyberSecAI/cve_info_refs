Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1710:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `db2licm` tool within IBM Db2.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Buffer Overflow: The `db2licm` tool does not properly handle input data, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to program crashes.
- It may allow for the execution of arbitrary code on the affected system, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when a user interacts with the vulnerable `db2licm` tool. This likely involves supplying crafted input that exceeds buffer boundaries.
- Specific attack vector details are not explicitly provided but are likely related to how db2licm processes its input parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need the ability to execute the `db2licm` tool and provide malformed or oversized inputs that exploit the buffer overflow.
- This might involve having local access to the affected system or the ability to execute commands indirectly through another vulnerable service.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects IBM Db2 V10.1, V10.5, and V11.1 on all platforms.
- IBM has provided fixes for this vulnerability, which are available for download from Fix Central or specific links in the bulletin.
- There are no workarounds or mitigations available for this vulnerability aside from applying the vendor-provided patch.
- The vulnerability was reported to IBM by Rich Mirch.
