- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability arises due to the way WebSphere Application Server handles TLS when FIPS is enabled and the keystores/truststores are configured using the JVM property `com.ibm.ssl.protocol`. This configuration can lead to a weaker than expected security, potentially allowing a TLS downgrade.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The weakness is in the TLS implementation of the WebSphere Application Server when specific configurations are used, which makes the server vulnerable to TLS downgrade attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to a TLS downgrade, potentially exposing sensitive data transmitted over the connection.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves a network-based attacker that is able to manipulate the TLS negotiation process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be positioned on the network to intercept and manipulate TLS handshake messages. They must have the capability to cause a downgrade to a weaker encryption protocol.
