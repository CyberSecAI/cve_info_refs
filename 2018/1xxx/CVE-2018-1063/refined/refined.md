Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1063:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
The content explicitly mentions `CVE-2018-1063` and describes a vulnerability related to policycoreutils, aligning with the CVE description, though the exact description is not included in the prompt.

**2. Root Cause of the Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how `policycoreutils` handles symbolic links during file system relabeling. Specifically, when relabeling files in `/tmp` and `/var/tmp`, the tool incorrectly changes the SELinux context of the *target* of the symbolic link instead of the symbolic link itself.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Symbolic Link Vulnerability:** The core issue is the incorrect handling of symlinks during SELinux context relabeling.
- **Incorrect Target Context Modification:** The relabeling process modifies the SELinux context of the *target* file or directory, which violates security principles and allows for potential privilege escalation.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Context Change:** A local, unprivileged user can manipulate symbolic links in `/tmp` or `/var/tmp` to change the SELinux context of an arbitrary file or directory.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By manipulating the target file's SELinux context, an attacker can effectively bypass SELinux protections. This can lead to the arbitrary file having a less restrictive context, potentially allowing the attacker to gain unauthorized access, modify sensitive data, or execute code with elevated privileges.
- **System Compromise:** In severe cases, this could lead to full system compromise or complete take over of the system.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The vulnerability requires local access to the system.
- **File System Manipulation:** The attack involves creating and manipulating symbolic links in `/tmp` or `/var/tmp`.
- **Relabel Trigger:** The vulnerability is triggered during SELinux relabeling process, which occurs when SELinux is enabled or when `restorecon` is used.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User:** The attacker must have a local user account on the target system, but it does not require root access to perform the initial attack steps.
- **File Write Access in /tmp or /var/tmp:** The attacker needs the ability to create symlinks in `/tmp` or `/var/tmp`.

**Mitigation:**
Remove any symbolic links from /tmp and /var/tmp directories before relabeling the file system.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Timing:** The vulnerability occurs specifically during the SELinux relabeling process, which is usually performed when switching SELinux from disabled to enabled modes.
- **Fixed Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in `policycoreutils-2.5-22.el7` and is delivered via RHSA-2018:0913.
