- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM Quality Manager (RQM) is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, allowing the embedding of arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can alter the intended functionality of the web application and potentially disclose credentials within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors**: By embedding malicious JavaScript code into the Web UI of the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Requires a user with the ability to input content into the web UI which is then rendered, and the user needs to trigger the malicious payload by interacting with it. The attacker needs to have at least the privileges of a normal user (low privileges).
