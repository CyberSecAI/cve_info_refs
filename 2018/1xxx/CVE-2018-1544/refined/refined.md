- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `db2exmig` and `db2exfmt` tools.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** If a customer's application or script runs with elevated privileges and executes the vulnerable tools, it could lead to privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required, it cannot be remotely exploited. An attacker needs to be able to execute the vulnerable tools, especially in scenarios where the tools are called by other applications or scripts running with elevated privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A local user with the ability to execute the vulnerable tools, especially in the context of a script or application running with elevated privileges.
