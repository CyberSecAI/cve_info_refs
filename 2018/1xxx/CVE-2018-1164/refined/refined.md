Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1164:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by improper access controls in the ZyXEL P-870H-51 DSL Router. Specifically, numerous exposed CGI endpoints allow access to critical functions without requiring authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Missing Authentication:** The primary weakness is the lack of authentication requirements for accessing sensitive functions through CGI endpoints.
*  **Improper access control**: The lack of authentication allows unauthorized access to critical functionalities.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service condition, which includes rebooting the affected device.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Although the provided text doesn't explicitly mention Remote Code Execution, it does say "along with other actions", and the CVSS score indicates that there is complete compromise, so RCE is implied.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, with attackers not requiring local access.
*   **Network:**  Attackers can send crafted requests to the vulnerable CGI endpoints over the network to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable router.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker doesn't need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
*   The Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) publicly disclosed this vulnerability without a patch, as ZyXEL stated the device was legacy and past its end-of-support date.
*   Mitigation advice provided includes using firewall rules or whitelisting to restrict access to the router's services to only trusted machines.
