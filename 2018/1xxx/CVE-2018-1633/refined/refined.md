Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-1633:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a symbolic link issue within the `onsrvapd` component of IBM Informix Dynamic Server v12.10.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Symbolic Link Vulnerability:** The core weakness lies in the improper handling of symbolic links within the `onsrvapd` component. This allows a malicious user to manipulate file paths.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows a local user, who is logged in with database administrator privileges, to gain root privileges on the system. This means the attacker can take full control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to be on the system to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Symbolic Link Manipulation:** The attacker uses symbolic link manipulation to gain root access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:**  The attacker must be a local user on the system.
*  **Database Administrator User:** The attacker needs to be logged in with database administrator privileges.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as HIGH severity with a CVSS base score of 8.2.
*   The provided information suggests this vulnerability is one of several similar issues in IBM Informix Dynamic Server v12.10 that could allow for privilege escalation via symbolic link vulnerabilities.
