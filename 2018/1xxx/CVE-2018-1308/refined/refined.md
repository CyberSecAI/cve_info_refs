Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1308:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an XML External Entity (XXE) expansion issue in the DataImportHandler (DIH) of Apache Solr. Specifically, it occurs when processing the `dataConfig` request parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XXE (XML External Entity) Injection:** The application parses XML input from the `dataConfig` parameter without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious XML code. This injected XML can include external entity references, leading to XXE attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A successful XXE attack allows an attacker to read arbitrary local files from the Solr server or the internal network by referencing external entities (files) in the injected XML. This can expose sensitive data, configuration files, and other confidential information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Parameter Injection:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability by crafting malicious XML payloads within the `dataConfig` parameter of an HTTP request to the Solr server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires the ability to send HTTP requests to the Solr server.
- **Understanding of Solr API:** The attacker needs some knowledge of how the DataImportHandler and its `dataConfig` parameter work.
- **Ability to Craft XML Payloads:** The attacker must be able to construct XML payloads containing external entity references to exploit the XXE vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Solr, including those based on Lucene.
- Patches were released in Solr versions 6.6.3, 7.3 and 8.0 to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was identified as part of a security report and tracked as SOLR-11971 in the Apache JIRA system.
- Debian has released security advisories (DSA-4194-1) and security updates to address the vulnerability in their lucene-solr packages.
