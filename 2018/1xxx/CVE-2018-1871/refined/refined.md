- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the Web UI of IBM Financial Transaction Manager for Check Services, allowing for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within a user's browser session. This could lead to altering the intended functionality of the web application and potentially to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker can embed malicious JavaScript code in the Web UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to inject JavaScript code into the vulnerable web application's UI.
