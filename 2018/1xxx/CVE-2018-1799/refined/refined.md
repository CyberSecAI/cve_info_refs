Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2018-1799:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a symbolic link attack vulnerability within IBM Db2 for Linux, UNIX, and Windows.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability lies in the way IBM Db2 handles symbolic links, allowing a local user or db2 instance owner to potentially manipulate file access permissions through these links.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to privilege escalation, allowing the attacker to gain root access. This could enable the attacker to read, write, or corrupt files they would not normally have permission to access.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have local access to the system where the vulnerable Db2 instance is running. The specific vector involves exploiting symbolic link vulnerabilities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
For CVE-2018-1799 specifically, the attacker needs to be a local db2 instance owner. They are able to exploit the vulnerability locally, without requiring any user interaction.
