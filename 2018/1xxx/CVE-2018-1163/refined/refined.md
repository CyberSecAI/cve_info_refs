Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the JSON RPC request handling of Quest NetVault Backup. Specifically, the `checksession` parameter can be manipulated to bypass authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is an authentication bypass that allows remote attackers to circumvent the normal login procedures.
*   **JSON RPC Request Handling Flaw:** The improper handling of the `checksession` parameter in JSON RPC requests is the root cause of the bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full System Compromise:** By exploiting this authentication bypass, an attacker could gain access to critical functions and potentially execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges by chaining with other vulnerabilities. This could lead to complete control of the affected system.
*   **Data Breach:** With system level access attackers can steal sensitive data.
*   **Service Disruption:** Attackers could modify configurations or disable the backup service, leading to service disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** This vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected Quest NetVault Backup server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Accessibility:** The attacker must be able to send network requests to the vulnerable service.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerability and understand how to craft malicious JSON RPC requests with the specific `checksession` parameter value.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Public Disclosure:** The vulnerability was publicly disclosed without a patch due to the Zero Day Initiative's (ZDI) 120-day disclosure deadline.
*  **Vendor Response**: The vulnerability was reported to Dell/Quest in May 2017, after which multiple other vulnerabilities were also reported. A patch was eventually released with NetVault v11.4.5.15.
*   **Mitigation:** The suggested mitigation strategy is to restrict network access to the NetVault Backup service to only trusted machines using firewalls or whitelisting.
*   **Trend Micro Protection:**  Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by Digital Vaccine filter ID 28896.
