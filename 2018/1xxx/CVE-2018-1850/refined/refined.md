Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1850:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in IBM Security Access Manager Appliance's Advanced Access Control services. This flaw allows for unauthorized operations. The specific nature of the flaw is not detailed in this document.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authorization Bypass:** The vulnerability allows unauthorized operations. This suggests a lack of proper authorization checks or a flaw in the access control mechanisms when Advanced Access Control services are running.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Operations:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to perform actions they are not permitted to do, potentially leading to:
    *   Data breaches
    *   System compromise
    *   Disruption of services
    *   Privilege escalation
    *   Data modification

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The CVSS vector (AV:N) indicates the attack is network-based and can be exploited remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges (PR:L):** An attacker with low privileges can exploit this vulnerability, meaning they don't need high-level administrative access.
*   **No User Interaction (UI:N):** The attack does not require any user interaction.

**CVSS Metrics:**

*   **CVSS Base Score:** 8.8 (High severity)
*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
    *   **AV:N (Network):** The attack vector is network based.
    *   **AC:L (Low):** The attack complexity is low.
    *   **PR:L (Low):** Low privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerability.
    *  **UI:N (None):** No user interaction is required.
    *   **S:U (Unchanged):** The security scope is unchanged.
    *   **C:H (High):** The impact on confidentiality is high.
    *  **I:H (High):** The impact on integrity is high.
    *  **A:H (High):** The impact on availability is high.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

*   IBM Security Access Manager Appliance versions 9.0.3.1, 9.0.4.0, and 9.0.5.0 are affected.

**Remediation:**

*   Upgrade to version 9.0.5.0
*   Apply 9.0.5.0 Interim Fix 2

**Additional Notes:**

*   There are no workarounds or mitigations listed.
* The vulnerability affects multiple IBM products including IBM Security Access Manager for Mobile and Tivoli Access Manager for e-business, all versions between 9.0.3.1 and 9.0.5.0.
