- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a flaw in IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management - Collaborative Edition that allows an authenticated user with CA level access to change their ca-id to that of another user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is an insecure direct object reference where a user can modify their user identifier to impersonate another user.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read sensitive information belonging to the impersonated user.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves an authenticated user with "CA level" access maliciously modifying their ca-id to impersonate another user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have valid credentials with "CA level" access within the IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management - Collaborative Edition.
