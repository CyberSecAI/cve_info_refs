- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A vulnerability in IBM Business Space allows an attacker to cause an external service invocation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability stems from the ability of an attacker to trigger an external service invocation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially invoke external services leading to unintended actions or information disclosure depending on the nature of the invoked service and attacker's control over the invocation.
- **Attack vectors**: The document specifies a vulnerability exists in the IBM Business Space which allows for the described external service invocation, but does not detail the vector itself.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The document does not specify the attacker capabilities or position, other than being able to exploit the vulnerability within IBM Business Space.
