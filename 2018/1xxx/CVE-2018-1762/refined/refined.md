**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-1762

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue affecting components used by multiple IBM Rational products. The specific nature of the vulnerability isn't detailed, but it stems from how user input is handled within the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The vulnerability allows for the injection of malicious scripts into the web application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker could inject malicious scripts that, when executed by a victim's browser, could lead to various attacks, including:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Data theft
    *   Defacement of the application
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Phishing attempts.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector involves injecting malicious scripts through user-provided input within the affected IBM Rational products. This could be through fields, parameters, or other input points that aren't properly sanitized.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker needs to be able to input or manipulate data that is processed by the vulnerable web application components. This typically requires an understanding of the application's input mechanisms. The attacker might need to be logged in, or be able to interact with the affected functionality in some way.
