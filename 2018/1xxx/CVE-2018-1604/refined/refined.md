- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization in IBM Quality Manager (RQM), allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI, potentially leading to the disclosure of credentials within a trusted session or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious user could embed JavaScript code in the Web UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires the ability to embed malicious Javascript code in the web UI, which according to the CVSS vector (PR:L) can be achieved with low privileges. The user interaction (UI:R) implies that the victim would also have to interact with the malicious payload.
