| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1552714#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2018-03-07 15:29:46 UTC  ``` A cross-site request forgery flaw was found in etcd 3.3.1 and earlier. An attacker can set up a website that tries to send a POST request to the etcd server and modify a key. Adding a key is done with PUT so it is theoretically safe (can't PUT from an HTML form or such) but POST allows creating in-order keys that an attacker can send.  Upstream bug:  <https://github.com/coreos/etcd/issues/9353>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1552714#c1)  Pedro Sampaio    2018-03-07 15:42:22 UTC  ``` Created etcd tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1552720](show_bug.cgi?id=1552720 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-1098 CVE-2018-1099 etcd: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1552714#c6)  Riccardo Schirone    2018-06-12 09:58:25 UTC  ``` Reference: <https://www.twistlock.com/2018/02/28/dear-developers-beware-dns-rebinding/>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1552714#c8)  Riccardo Schirone    2018-06-12 12:17:11 UTC  ``` If etcd supports the new v3 API, the attacker can run more operations through POST, as described in the reference blog post.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1552714#c11)  Riccardo Schirone    2018-06-19 08:13:19 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Configure and enable authentication on the etcd server.   ``` |  |

## Description

[![@zelivans](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15815884?u=03087f76aaecbe31de1834cecedf443088ae02a8&v=4&size=48)](/zelivans)[zelivans](https://github.com/zelivans)opened [on Feb 25, 2018](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/9353#issue-300019696)

After explaining the issue in private with the security mailing list, we determined it is low enough in severity to make it a public discussion.

This issue is relevant only to etcd deployment on local networks with no authentication scheme set up. It may not be a common scenario but it affects anyone who work with etcd locally or on a local network and use it without authentication, which is the default. For the sake of demonstration, I'm using a scenario where etcd is deployed on localhost. This can be any LAN address though (the attacker would have to know the address as a perquisite, but localhost is pretty common).

The first issue is with [CSRF](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_%28CSRF%29). An attacker can set up a website that tries to send a POST request to the etcd server and modify a key. Adding a key is done with PUT so it is theoretically safe (can't PUT from an HTML form or such) but POST allows creating in-order keys that an attacker can send.

Example PoC:

```
<html>
    <body onload="document.forms[0].submit()">
        <h1>CSRF</h1>
        <form action="http://localhost:2379/v2/keys/bla" method="POST">
            <input type="hidden" name="value" value="MALICIOUS"/>
            <input type="submit" value="Send"/>
        </form>
    </body>
</html>

```

The second issue is with [DNS rebinding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_rebinding). It essentially means an attacker can control his DNS records to direct to localhost, and trick the browser into sending requests to localhost (or any other address).

There are many resources on how this attack works.

PoC [here](https://github.com/twistlock/etcd_DNSRebinding) (based on [taviso's work](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1447)). If the issue is unclear though please let me know and I will explain the attack in further details.

Success example:

Whitelisting hostnames is a possible simple solution. See [taviso's comment](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1447#c2) on this or the [fix](https://github.com/transmission/transmission/pull/468) he sent to Transmission.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1651034#c0)  Sam Fowler    2018-11-19 01:27:46 UTC  ``` Etcd, versions 3.2.0 through 3.2.25 and 3.3.0 through 3.3.10, are vulnerable to an improper authentication issue when role-based access control (RBAC) is used and client-cert-auth is enabled. If an etcd client server's TLS certificate contains a Common Name (CN) which matches a valid RBAC username, a remote attacker may authenticate as that user with any valid (trusted) client certificate in a REST API request to the gRPC-gateway.  Introduced in commit: <https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/commit/0191509637546621d6f2e18e074e955ab8ef374d>  Upstream issue: <https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/10366>  Upstream patch: <https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/commit/bf9d0d8291dc71ecbfb2690612954e1a298154b2> <https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/commit/a9a9466fb8ba11ad7bb6a44d7446fbd072d59887> <https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/commit/99704e2a97e8710da942bdc737417fc9c9a2c03f> <https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/commit/83c051b701d33261eef91a719e4421c81b000ba4>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1651034#c3)  Sam Batschelet    2018-11-27 13:11:40 UTC  ``` From my review, this issue is not reproducible.

Or, is there anything else left to be done before the PR can be accepted?   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1651034#c8)  Sam Batschelet    2019-01-08 12:52:05 UTC  ``` Jan, The PR should be merged today and a new release cut shortly. As far as scope this also affects all etcd 3.2.x and 3.3.x that is using --client-cert-auth.

FTR this issue does not require grpc-proxy.  If etcd is using RBAC and `--client-cert-auth` is enabled. Make sure that the client server certificate `--cert-file` does not include a common name. IF a common name is part of this certificate consider removing. If removal is not possible understand that a RBAC user with username = to CN can be exploited by any REST request to the gRPC-gateway. Essentially the username in the CA will always be used during authentication.   openssl x509 -noout -subject -in client.pem | grep -o 'CN.*'  example curl --key $key --cert $cert --cacert $ca -L <https://localhost:2379/v3beta/kv/put> \   -X POST -d '{"key": "Zm9v", "value": "YmFy"}'   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=1651034#c24)  Jan Chaloupka    2019-01-11 15:41:05 UTC  ``` Sam,  checking the etcd release [1] I still don't see any new update.

I should know more today, I am sorry this process takes so long but we (etcd) currently are dependent on 2 specific maintainers to cut an etcd release. I am trying to get involved in this process to improve this turn around.   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=1651034#c28)  Sam Batschelet    2019-01-11 22:06:06 UTC  ``` <https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases>  v3.3.11 and v3.3.26 are now live.   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=1651034#c30)  Paul Harvey    2019-01-14 00:27:59 UTC  ``` Re-worded flaw description according to common 23, thanks Sam.

If a Common Name field is part of this certificate, replace it with one which omits it.  To check the CN field of a certificate:   openssl x509 -noout -subject -in /path/to/client.crt | grep -o 'CN.*'  To check if there is a username matching the CN field in the TLS client certificate:   etcdctl user get <TLS client certificate CN>  For more information on TLS authentication features including how client-cert-auth is enabled, refer to the etcd transport security model documentation: <https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/op-guide/security.md> For more information on Role-based access control including how it is enabled, refer to the etcd role-based access control documentation: <https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/op-guide/authentication.md>   ```  [Comment 35](show_bug.cgi?id=1651034#c35)  Paul Harvey    2019-01-14 01:04:09 UTC  ``` <https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/1eee465a43720d713bb69f7b7f5e120135fdb1ac/CHANGELOG-3.3.md#security-authentication> <https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/1eee465a43720d713bb69f7b7f5e120135fdb1ac/CHANGELOG-3.2.md#security-authentication>   ```  [Comment 37](show_bug.cgi?id=1651034#c37)  Paul Harvey    2019-01-14 01:55:01 UTC  ``` Created etcd tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1665782](show_bug.cgi?id=1665782 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-16886 etcd: Improper Authentication in auth/store.go:AuthInfoFromTLS() via gRPC-gateway [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 38](show_bug.cgi?id=1651034#c38)  Paul Harvey    2019-01-14 03:36:40 UTC  ``` This isn't really an auth bypass; the mutual TLS authentication is still working, it's more that our REST endpoint is makeing an auth decision based on irrelevant data.
