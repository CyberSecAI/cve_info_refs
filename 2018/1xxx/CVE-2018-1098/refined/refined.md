{
  "CVE-2018-1098": {
    "description": "A cross-site request forgery flaw was found in etcd 3.3.1 and earlier. An attacker can set up a website that tries to send a POST request to the etcd server and modify a key. Adding a key is done with PUT so it is theoretically safe (can't PUT from an HTML form or such) but POST allows creating in-order keys that an attacker can send.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a result of etcd server processing POST requests without proper CSRF protection. Specifically, the server allows the creation of in-order keys via POST requests, which can be triggered by a malicious website.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can modify or add keys to the etcd datastore, potentially disrupting services relying on etcd or gaining unauthorized access to sensitive configuration data.",
        "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious website crafted by an attacker to send POST requests to the etcd server"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to set up a malicious website that can make POST requests to the etcd server. The etcd server must be accessible from the victim's browser."
