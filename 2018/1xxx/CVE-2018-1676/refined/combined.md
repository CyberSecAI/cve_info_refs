CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2017-3736](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3736)

**DESCRIPTION:** OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a carry propagation flaw in the x86\_64 Montgomery squaring function bn\_sqrx8x\_internal(). An attacker with online access to an unpatched system could exploit this vulnerability to obtain information about the private key.

CVSS Base Score: 5.9

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/134397> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

**CVEID:** [CVE-2017-3738](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3738)

**DESCRIPTION:** OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an overflow bug in the AVX2 Montgomery multiplication procedure used in exponentiation with 1024-bit moduli. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain information about the private key. Note: In order to exploit this vulnerability, the server would have to share the DH1024 private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701.

CVSS Base Score: 3.1

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/136078> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

**CVEID:** [CVE-2017-10356](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-10356)

**DESCRIPTION:** An unspecified vulnerability related to the Java SE Security component could allow an unauthenticated attacker to obtain sensitive information resulting in a high confidentiality impact using unknown attack vectors.

CVSS Base Score: 6.2

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/133785> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**DESCRIPTION:** IBM Planning Analytics is vulnerable to cross-site scripting. This vulnerability allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI thus altering the intended functionality potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.

CVSS Base Score: 6.1

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/145118> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2018-1426](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1426)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2018-1428](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1428)

**DESCRIPTION:** IBM GSKit uses weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms that could allow an attacker to decrypt highly sensitive information.

CVSS Base Score: 6.2

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/139073> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined
