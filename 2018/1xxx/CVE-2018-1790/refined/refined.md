- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a potential cross-site request forgery (CSRF) issue.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application is vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could allow an attacker to execute malicious and unauthorized actions transmitted from a user that the website trusts.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a cross-site request forgery, where an attacker tricks a user into unknowingly making a request to the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request that is then executed by an authenticated user. The attacker needs to be able to convince the victim to trigger this crafted request.
