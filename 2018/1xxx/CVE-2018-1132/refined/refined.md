Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2018-1132:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw in the `SDNInterfaceapp` component of OpenDaylight.
*   The root cause lies in the lack of sanitization of input parameters used in a SQL query within the `SdniDataBase.java` file, specifically on lines 373~391.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized input being directly used in constructing SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Attackers can inject malicious SQL code into the application's database (SQLite).
*   Successful exploitation could allow attackers to potentially read, modify, or delete data in the database, or potentially gain further access to the system, though this is not explicitly detailed.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the `SDNInterfaceapp` component. The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication to either the controller or the SDNInterfaceapp.
*   The vulnerable parameters are exchanged between federated OpenDaylight installs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send crafted input to the vulnerable component to inject SQL code into the database.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication.
*   A certain level of trust may exist between federated OpenDaylight installs, meaning that access may be internal.

**Additional details:**

*   The `SDNInterfaceapp` component has been deprecated in OpenDaylight since the Carbon release, and it is not included in Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) packages.
*   Red Hat has classified this vulnerability as "NOTABUG" because the vulnerable component is not included in their packaged distribution.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Feng Xiao and Jianwei Huang from Wuhan University.

The vulnerability is located in the following file: `/impl/src/main/java/org/opendaylight/sdninterfaceapp/impl/database/SdniDataBase.java` (lines 373~391)
