  "CVE-2018-1097": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in foreman. The issue allows users with limited permissions for powering oVirt/RHV hosts on and off to discover the username and password used to connect to the compute resource.",
    "affected_products": [
      "Red Hat Satellite 6.4",
      "Red Hat Satellite Capsule 6.4"
    ],
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The foreman API exposed the oVirt admin password when querying the power status of a host. This was due to the way the API returned the credentials used to connect to the compute resource.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Information Disclosure",
        "Exposure of Sensitive Information"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker with limited permissions could retrieve the oVirt admin password, allowing them to gain unauthorized access to the compute resource and potentially other systems.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network"
      ],
        "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have limited permissions to power oVirt/RHV hosts on/off via foreman.",
       "additional_information":"The vulnerability was addressed by modifying the foreman code to filter out the password from the API response."
