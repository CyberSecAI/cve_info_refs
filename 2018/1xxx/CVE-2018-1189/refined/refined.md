Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1189:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `name` parameter of the `/antivirus/policies` endpoint within the Dell EMC Isilon OneFS web administration interface.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input when creating or modifying antivirus policies. This allows a malicious user to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code within the `name` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution in Browser:** When a user accesses the Antivirus page within the OneFS web administration interface, the injected XSS payload is executed in the user's browser.
*   **Potential for malicious actions**: An attacker can use this vulnerability to potentially perform malicious actions on the user's browser and potentially on the system based on the users' privileges within the web administration interface.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Web interface:** An attacker sends a POST request to `/platform/3/antivirus/policies` with a malicious payload in the `name` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Administrator access:** The attacker needs to be a malicious administrator that is able to create or modify antivirus policies.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the specific endpoint `/antivirus/policies` and the vulnerable parameter `name`.
