- **Root cause of vulnerability**:  The vulnerability is caused by a property path parser in Spring Data Commons that allows unlimited resource allocation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unlimited resource allocation in the property path parser.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated remote attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by sending crafted requests that consume excessive CPU and memory resources, potentially crashing the application.
- **Attack vectors**:  The attack is performed remotely by sending malicious requests to Spring Data REST endpoints or endpoints that use property path parsing.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be unauthenticated and needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable endpoints.
