# Changelog[Â¶](#changelog "Permalink to this headline")

## Python 3.6.15 final[Â¶](#python-3-6-15-final "Permalink to this headline")

*Release date: 2021-09-03*

### Security[Â¶](#security "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-44394](https://bugs.python.org/issue44394): Update the vendored copy of libexpat to 2.4.1 (from 2.2.8) to
  get the fix for the CVE-2013-0340 âBillion Laughsâ vulnerability. This
  copy is most used on Windows and macOS.
* [bpo-43124](https://bugs.python.org/issue43124): Made the internal `putcmd` function in [`smtplib`](../library/smtplib.html#module-smtplib "smtplib: SMTP protocol client (requires sockets).")
  sanitize input for presence of `\r` and `\n` characters to avoid
  (unlikely) command injection.

### Library[Â¶](#library "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-45001](https://bugs.python.org/issue45001): Made email date parsing more robust against malformed input,
  namely a whitespace-only `Date:` header. Patch by Wouter Bolsterlee.

### Tests[Â¶](#tests "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-38965](https://bugs.python.org/issue38965): Fix test\_faulthandler on GCC 10. Use the âvolatileâ keyword in
  `faulthandler._stack_overflow()` to prevent tail call optimization on
  any compiler, rather than relying on compiler specific pragma.

## Python 3.6.14 final[Â¶](#python-3-6-14-final "Permalink to this headline")

*Release date: 2021-06-28*

### Security[Â¶](#id2 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-44022](https://bugs.python.org/issue44022): [`http.client`](../library/http.client.html#module-http.client "http.client: HTTP and HTTPS protocol client (requires sockets).") now avoids infinitely reading potential HTTP
  headers after a `100 Continue` status response from the server.
* [bpo-43882](https://bugs.python.org/issue43882): The presence of newline or tab characters in parts of a URL
  could allow some forms of attacks.

  Following the controlling specification for URLs defined by WHATWG
  [`urllib.parse()`](../library/urllib.parse.html#module-urllib.parse "urllib.parse: Parse URLs into or assemble them from components.") now removes ASCII newlines and tabs from URLs,
  preventing such attacks.
* [bpo-42988](https://bugs.python.org/issue42988): CVE-2021-3426: Remove the `getfile` feature of the
  [`pydoc`](../library/pydoc.html#module-pydoc "pydoc: Documentation generator and online help system.") module which could be abused to read arbitrary files on the
  disk (directory traversal vulnerability). Moreover, even source code of
  Python modules can contain sensitive data like passwords. Vulnerability
  reported by David SchwÃ¶rer.
* [bpo-43285](https://bugs.python.org/issue43285): [`ftplib`](../library/ftplib.html#module-ftplib "ftplib: FTP protocol client (requires sockets).") no longer trusts the IP address value returned
  from the server in response to the PASV command by default. This prevents
  a malicious FTP server from using the response to probe IPv4 address and
  port combinations on the client network.

  Code that requires the former vulnerable behavior may set a
  `trust_server_pasv_ipv4_address` attribute on their [`ftplib.FTP`](../library/ftplib.html#ftplib.FTP "ftplib.FTP")
  instances to `True` to re-enable it.
* [bpo-43075](https://bugs.python.org/issue43075): Fix Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability
  in [`urllib.request.AbstractBasicAuthHandler`](../library/urllib.request.html#urllib.request.AbstractBasicAuthHandler "urllib.request.AbstractBasicAuthHandler"). The ReDoS-vulnerable
  regex has quadratic worst-case complexity and it allows cause a denial of
  service when identifying crafted invalid RFCs. This ReDoS issue is on the
  client side and needs remote attackers to control the HTTP server.

## Python 3.6.13 final[Â¶](#python-3-6-13-final "Permalink to this headline")

*Release date: 2021-02-15*

### Security[Â¶](#id3 "Permalink to this headline")

  args separator to `&`, and allowing the user to choose a custom
  separator.
* [bpo-42938](https://bugs.python.org/issue42938): Avoid static buffers when computing the repr of
  [`ctypes.c_double`](../library/ctypes.html#ctypes.c_double "ctypes.c_double") and [`ctypes.c_longdouble`](../library/ctypes.html#ctypes.c_longdouble "ctypes.c_longdouble") values.
* [bpo-42103](https://bugs.python.org/issue42103): Prevented potential DoS attack via CPU and RAM exhaustion when
  processing malformed Apple Property List files in binary format.
* [bpo-42051](https://bugs.python.org/issue42051): The [`plistlib`](../library/plistlib.html#module-plistlib "plistlib: Generate and parse Mac OS X plist files.") module no longer accepts entity
  declarations in XML plist files to avoid XML vulnerabilities. This should
  not affect users as entity declarations are not used in regular plist
  files.
* [bpo-40791](https://bugs.python.org/issue40791): Add `volatile` to the accumulator variable in
  `hmac.compare_digest`, making constant-time-defeating optimizations less
  likely.

* [bpo-35560](https://bugs.python.org/issue35560): Fix an assertion error in [`format()`](../library/functions.html#format "format") in debug build for
  floating point formatting with ânâ format, zero padding and small width.
  Release build is not impacted. Patch by Karthikeyan Singaravelan.

### Library[Â¶](#id4 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-42103](https://bugs.python.org/issue42103): `InvalidFileException` and [`RecursionError`](../library/exceptions.html#RecursionError "RecursionError")

  instead of libcrypt at the system.

### Windows[Â¶](#id62 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-33016](https://bugs.python.org/issue33016): Fix potential use of uninitialized memory in
  nt.\_getfinalpathname
* [bpo-32903](https://bugs.python.org/issue32903): Fix a memory leak in os.chdir() on Windows if the current
  directory is set to a UNC path.
* [bpo-31966](https://bugs.python.org/issue31966): Fixed WindowsConsoleIO.write() for writing empty data.

* [bpo-32726](https://bugs.python.org/issue32726): Provide an additional, more modern macOS installer variant that
  supports macOS 10.9+ systems in 64-bit mode only. Upgrade the supplied
  third-party libraries to OpenSSL 1.0.2n, XZ 5.2.3, and SQLite 3.22.0. The
  10.9+ installer now links with and supplies its own copy of Tcl/Tk 8.6.8.

### IDLE[Â¶](#id64 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-32984](https://bugs.python.org/issue32984): Set `__file__` while running a startup file. Like Python,
  IDLE optionally runs one startup file in the Shell window before
  presenting the first interactive input prompt. For IDLE, `-s` runs a
  file named in environmental variable `IDLESTARTUP` or
  [`PYTHONSTARTUP`](../using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONSTARTUP); `-r file` runs `file`. Python sets
  `__file__` to the startup file name before running the file and unsets
  it before the first prompt. IDLE now does the same when run normally,
  without the `-n` option.
* [bpo-32940](https://bugs.python.org/issue32940): Simplify and rename StringTranslatePseudoMapping in pyparse.

  open() is a bad idea for IDLEâs system and location-independent files.
* [bpo-32826](https://bugs.python.org/issue32826): Add âencoding=utf-8â to open() in IDLEâs test\_help\_about. GUI
  test test\_file\_buttons() only looks at initial ascii-only lines, but
  failed on systems where open() defaults to âasciiâ because readline()
  internally reads and decodes far enough ahead to encounter a non-ascii
  character in CREDITS.txt.
* [bpo-32765](https://bugs.python.org/issue32765): Update configdialog General tab docstring to add new widgets to
  the widget list.

### Tools/Demos[Â¶](#id65 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-24960](https://bugs.python.org/issue24960): 2to3 and lib2to3 can now read pickled grammar files using
  pkgutil.get\_data() rather than probing the filesystem. This lets 2to3 and
  lib2to3 work when run from a zipfile.
* [bpo-32222](https://bugs.python.org/issue32222): Fix pygettext not extracting docstrings for functions with type
  annotated arguments. Patch by Toby Harradine.

### C API[Â¶](#id66 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-29084](https://bugs.python.org/issue29084): Undocumented C API for OrderedDict has been excluded from the
  limited C API. It was added by mistake and actually never worked in the
  limited C API.

### Core and Builtins[Â¶](#id67 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-32176](https://bugs.python.org/issue32176): co\_flags.CO\_NOFREE is now always set correctly by the code
  object constructor based on freevars and cellvars, rather than needing to
  be set correctly by the caller. This ensures it will be cleared
  automatically when additional cell references are injected into a modified
  code object and function.
* [bpo-31949](https://bugs.python.org/issue31949): Fixed several issues in printing tracebacks
  (PyTraceBack\_Print()).

  + Setting sys.tracebacklimit to 0 or less now suppresses printing tracebacks.
  + Setting sys.tracebacklimit to None now causes using the default limit.
  + Setting sys.tracebacklimit to an integer larger than LONG\_MAX now means using
    the limit LONG\_MAX rather than the default limit.

  exit, even if an exception in the chain is unhashable or compares equal to
  later ones. Patch by Zane Bitter.
* [bpo-31786](https://bugs.python.org/issue31786): Fix timeout rounding in the select module to round correctly
  negative timeouts between -1.0 and 0.0. The functions now block waiting

  ps1.

  The code module uses sys.ps1 if present or sets it to â>>> â if not.
  Test\_code\_module now properly tests both behaviors. Ditto for ps2.
* [bpo-28603](https://bugs.python.org/issue28603): Fix a TypeError that caused a shell restart when printing a
  traceback that includes an exception that is unhashable. Patch by Zane
  Bitter.
* [bpo-13802](https://bugs.python.org/issue13802): Use non-Latin characters in the IDLEâs Font settings sample.
  Even if one selects a font that defines a limited subset of the unicode
  Basic Multilingual Plane, tcl/tk will use other fonts that define a
  character. The expanded example give users of non-Latin characters a
  better idea of what they might see in IDLEâs shell and editors. To make
  room for the expanded sample, frames on the Font tab are re-arranged. The
  Font/Tabs help explains a bit about the additions.
* [bpo-31460](https://bugs.python.org/issue31460): Simplify the API of IDLEâs Module Browser.

  Passing a widget instead of an flist with a root widget opens the option
  of creating a browser frame that is only part of a window. Passing a full
  file name instead of pieces assumed to come from a .py file opens the
  possibility of browsing python files that do not end in .py.
* [bpo-31649](https://bugs.python.org/issue31649): IDLE - Make \_htest, \_utest parameters keyword only.
* [bpo-31559](https://bugs.python.org/issue31559): Remove test order dependence in idle\_test.test\_browser.
* [bpo-31459](https://bugs.python.org/issue31459): Rename IDLEâs module browser from Class Browser to Module
  Browser. The original module-level class and method browser became a
  module browser, with the addition of module-level functions, years ago.
  Nested classes and functions were added yesterday. For
  back-compatibility, the virtual event <<open-class-browser>>, which
  appears on the Keys tab of the Settings dialog, is not changed. Patch by
  Cheryl Sabella.
* [bpo-31500](https://bugs.python.org/issue31500): Default fonts now are scaled on HiDPI displays.
* [bpo-1612262](https://bugs.python.org/issue1612262): IDLE module browser now shows nested classes and functions.

  `PyErr_NormalizeException()` does not use it anymore. This singleton is
  persistent and its members being never cleared may cause a segfault during
  finalization of the interpreter. See also [bpo-22898](https://bugs.python.org/issue22898).

* [bpo-30703](https://bugs.python.org/issue30703): Improve signal delivery.

  Avoid using Py\_AddPendingCall from signal handler, to avoid calling
  signal-unsafe functions. The tests Iâm adding here fail without the rest
  of the patch, on Linux and OS X. This means our signal delivery logic had
  defects (some signals could be lost).

* [bpo-30822](https://bugs.python.org/issue30822): regrtest: Exclude tzdata from regrtest âall. When running the
  test suite using âuse=all / -u all, exclude tzdata since it makes
  test\_datetime too slow (15-20 min on some buildbots) which then times out
  on some buildbots. Fix also regrtest command line parser to allow passing

* [bpo-31287](https://bugs.python.org/issue31287): IDLE - Do not modify tkinter.message in test\_configdialog.
* [bpo-27099](https://bugs.python.org/issue27099): Convert IDLEâs built-in âextensionsâ to regular features.

  About 10 IDLE features were implemented as supposedly optional extensions.
  Their different behavior could be confusing or worse for users and not
  good for maintenance. Hence the conversion.

  The main difference for users is that user configurable key bindings for
  builtin features are now handled uniformly. Now, editing a binding in a
  keyset only affects its value in the keyset. All bindings are defined
  together in the system-specific default keysets in config-extensions.def.
  All custom keysets are saved as a whole in config-extension.cfg. All take
  effect as soon as one clicks Apply or Ok.

  The affected events are â<<force-open-completions>>â, â<<expand-word>>â,
  â<<force-open-calltip>>â, â<<flash-paren>>â, â<<format-paragraph>>â,
  â<<run-module>>â, â<<check-module>>â, and â<<zoom-height>>â. Any (global)
  customizations made before 3.6.3 will not affect their keyset-specific
  customization after 3.6.3. and vice versa.

### Tools/Demos[Â¶](#id87 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-30983](https://bugs.python.org/issue30983): gdb integration commands (py-bt, etc.) work on optimized shared
  builds now, too. PEP 523 introduced \_PyEval\_EvalFrameDefault which
  inlines PyEval\_EvalFrameEx on non-debug shared builds. This broke the
  ability to use py-bt, py-up, and a few other Python-specific gdb
  integrations. The problem is fixed by only looking for
  \_PyEval\_EvalFrameDefault frames in python-gdb.py. Original patch by Bruno
  âPolacoâ Penteado.

  infinite loop DoS), CVE-2016-9063 (Integer overflow, re-fix),
  CVE-2016-0718 (Fix regression bugs from 2.2.0âs fix to CVE-2016-0718) and
  CVE-2012-0876 (Counter hash flooding with SipHash). Note: the
  CVE-2016-5300 (Use os-specific entropy sources like getrandom) doesnât
  impact Python, since Python already gets entropy from the OS to set the
  expat secret using `XML_SetHashSalt()`.
* [bpo-30500](https://bugs.python.org/issue30500): Fix urllib.parse.splithost() to correctly parse fragments. For
  example, `splithost('//127.0.0.1#@evil.com/')` now correctly returns the
  `127.0.0.1` host, instead of treating `@evil.com` as the host in an
  authentication (`login@host`).

  if Py\_LIMITED\_API is not set.

### Build[Â¶](#id95 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-29941](https://bugs.python.org/issue29941): Add `--with-assertions` configure flag to explicitly enable C
  `assert()` checks. Defaults to off. `--with-pydebug` implies
  `--with-assertions`.
* [bpo-28787](https://bugs.python.org/issue28787): Fix out-of-tree builds of Python when configured with
  `--with--dtrace`.

* [bpo-29643](https://bugs.python.org/issue29643): Fix `--enable-optimization` didnât work.

### Documentation[Â¶](#id96 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-30176](https://bugs.python.org/issue30176): Add missing attribute related constants in curses
  documentation.
* [bpo-30052](https://bugs.python.org/issue30052): the link targets for [`bytes()`](../library/stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") and [`bytearray()`](../library/stdtypes.html#bytearray "bytearray") are
  now their respective type definitions, rather than the corresponding
  builtin function entries. Use [bytes](../library/functions.html#func-bytes) and
  [bytearray](../library/functions.html#func-bytearray) to reference the latter.

  In order to ensure this and future cross-reference updates are applied
  automatically, the daily documentation builds now disable the default
  output caching features in Sphinx.
* [bpo-26985](https://bugs.python.org/issue26985): Add missing info of code object in inspect documentation.

### Tools/Demos[Â¶](#id97 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-29367](https://bugs.python.org/issue29367): python-gdb.py now supports also `method-wrapper`
  (`wrapperobject`) objects.

### Tests[Â¶](#id98 "Permalink to this headline")

  side effects on following tests. Initial patch written by Grzegorz
  Grzywacz.
* [bpo-30197](https://bugs.python.org/issue30197): Enhanced functions swap\_attr() and swap\_item() in the
  test.support module. They now work when delete replaced attribute or item
  inside the with statement. The old value of the attribute or item (or
  None if it doesnât exist) now will be assigned to the target of the âasâ
  clause, if there is one.

### Windows[Â¶](#id99 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-30687](https://bugs.python.org/issue30687): Locate msbuild.exe on Windows when building rather than
  vcvarsall.bat
* [bpo-30450](https://bugs.python.org/issue30450): The build process on Windows no longer depends on Subversion,
  instead pulling external code from GitHub via a Python script. If Python
  3.6 is not found on the system (via `py -3.6`), NuGet is used to
  download a copy of 32-bit Python.

## Python 3.6.1 final[Â¶](#python-3-6-1-final "Permalink to this headline")

*Release date: 2017-03-21*

### Core and Builtins[Â¶](#id100 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-29723](https://bugs.python.org/issue29723): The `sys.path[0]` initialization change for [bpo-29139](https://bugs.python.org/issue29139) caused
  a regression by revealing an inconsistency in how sys.path is initialized
  when executing `__main__` from a zipfile, directory, or other import
  location. The interpreter now consistently avoids ever adding the import
  locationâs parent directory to `sys.path`, and ensures no other
  `sys.path` entries are inadvertently modified when inserting the import
  location named on the command line.

### Build[Â¶](#id101 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-27593](https://bugs.python.org/issue27593): fix format of git information used in sys.version
* Fix incompatible comment in python.h

## Python 3.6.1 release candidate 1[Â¶](#python-3-6-1-release-candidate-1 "Permalink to this headline")

  the current Python thread state, but donât issue a fatal error if it is
  NULL. This new function must be used instead of accessing directly the
  \_PyThreadState\_Current variable. The variable is no more exposed since

* [bpo-25626](https://bugs.python.org/issue25626): Change three zlib functions to accept sizes that fit in
  Py\_ssize\_t, but internally cap those sizes to UINT\_MAX. This resolves a
  regression in 3.5 where GzipFile.read() failed to read chunks larger than
  2 or 4 GiB. The change affects the zlib.Decompress.decompress()

  CREDITS.txt to utf-8 and open it with âutf-8â.
* [bpo-15348](https://bugs.python.org/issue15348): Stop the debugger engine (normally in a user process) before
  closing the debugger window (running in the IDLE process). This prevents
  the RuntimeErrors that were being caught and ignored.
* [bpo-24455](https://bugs.python.org/issue24455): Prevent IDLE from hanging when a) closing the shell while the
  debugger is active (15347); b) closing the debugger with the [X] button
  (15348); and c) activating the debugger when already active (24455). The
  patch by Mark Roseman does this by making two changes. 1. Suspend and
  resume the gui.interaction method with the tcl vwait mechanism intended
  for this purpose (instead of root.mainloop & .quit). 2. In gui.run, allow
  any existing interaction to terminate first.
* Change âThe programâ to âYour programâ in an IDLE âkill program?â message
  to make it clearer that the program referred to is the currently running
  user program, not IDLE itself.

  about the other buttons and the new IDLE Dark theme.
* [bpo-24820](https://bugs.python.org/issue24820): IDLE now has an âIDLE Darkâ built-in text color theme. It is
  more or less IDLE Classic inverted, with a cobalt blue background.
  Strings, comments, keywords, â¦ are still green, red, orange, â¦ . To
  use it with IDLEs released before November 2015, hit the âSave as New
  Custom Themeâ button and enter a new name, such as âCustom Darkâ. The
  custom theme will work with any IDLE release, and can be modified.
* [bpo-25224](https://bugs.python.org/issue25224): README.txt is now an idlelib index for IDLE developers and
  curious users. The previous user content is now in the IDLE doc chapter.
  âIDLEâ now means âIntegrated Development and Learning Environmentâ.

  OSX, make them a âsheetâ. Patch by Mark Roseman.
* [bpo-25198](https://bugs.python.org/issue25198): Enhance the initial html viewer now used for Idle Help.
  Properly indent fixed-pitch text (patch by Mark Roseman). Give code
  snippet a very Sphinx-like light blueish-gray background. Re-use initial
  width and height set by users for shell and editor. When the Table of

  with a null byte.
* [bpo-25462](https://bugs.python.org/issue25462): The hash of the key now is calculated only once in most

  of datetime.datetime: microseconds are now rounded to nearest with ties
  going to nearest even integer (ROUND\_HALF\_EVEN), instead of being rounding
  towards minus infinity (ROUND\_FLOOR). Itâs important that these methods
  use the same rounding mode than datetime.timedelta to keep the property:
  (datetime(1970,1,1) + timedelta(seconds=t)) ==
  datetime.utcfromtimestamp(t). It also the rounding mode used by
  round(float) for example.
* [bpo-25155](https://bugs.python.org/issue25155): Fix datetime.datetime.now() and datetime.datetime.utcnow() on
  Windows to support date after year 2038. It was a regression introduced in

  doesnât return a byte string. The encoder of the IDNA codec is now called
  directly instead of calling the encode() method of the string.

  collection) in collections.OrderedDict constructor.

### IDLE[Â¶](#id228 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-15348](https://bugs.python.org/issue15348): Stop the debugger engine (normally in a user process) before
  closing the debugger window (running in the IDLE process). This prevents
  the RuntimeErrors that were being caught and ignored.
* [bpo-24455](https://bugs.python.org/issue24455): Prevent IDLE from hanging when a) closing the shell while the
  debugger is active (15347); b) closing the debugger with the [X] button
  (15348); and c) activating the debugger when already active (24455). The
  patch by Mark Roseman does this by making two changes. 1. Suspend and
  resume the gui.interaction method with the tcl vwait mechanism intended
  for this purpose (instead of root.mainloop & .quit). 2. In gui.run, allow
  any existing interaction to terminate first.
* Change âThe programâ to âYour programâ in an IDLE âkill program?â message
  to make it clearer that the program referred to is the currently running
  user program, not IDLE itself.

  about the other buttons and the new IDLE Dark theme.
* [bpo-24820](https://bugs.python.org/issue24820): IDLE now has an âIDLE Darkâ built-in text color theme. It is
  more or less IDLE Classic inverted, with a cobalt blue background.
  Strings, comments, keywords, â¦ are still green, red, orange, â¦ . To
  use it with IDLEs released before November 2015, hit the âSave as New
  Custom Themeâ button and enter a new name, such as âCustom Darkâ. The
  custom theme will work with any IDLE release, and can be modified.
* [bpo-25224](https://bugs.python.org/issue25224): README.txt is now an idlelib index for IDLE developers and
  curious users. The previous user content is now in the IDLE doc chapter.
  âIDLEâ now means âIntegrated Development and Learning Environmentâ.
* [bpo-24820](https://bugs.python.org/issue24820): Users can now set breakpoint colors in Settings -> Custom
  Highlighting. Original patch by Mark Roseman.

  Mac Aqua. Patch by Mark Roseman.
* [bpo-24801](https://bugs.python.org/issue24801): Make right-click for context menu work on Mac Aqua. Patch by
  Mark Roseman.
* [bpo-25173](https://bugs.python.org/issue25173): Associate tkinter messageboxes with a specific widget. For Mac
  OSX, make them a âsheetâ. Patch by Mark Roseman.
* [bpo-25198](https://bugs.python.org/issue25198): Enhance the initial html viewer now used for Idle Help.
  Properly indent fixed-pitch text (patch by Mark Roseman). Give code
  snippet a very Sphinx-like light blueish-gray background. Re-use initial
  width and height set by users for shell and editor. When the Table of
  Contents (TOC) menu is used, put the section header at the top of the
  screen.

  idleib.idle.\* to start Idle. See idlelib.\_\_init\_\_.\_\_doc\_\_.
* [bpo-25199](https://bugs.python.org/issue25199): Idle: add synchronization comments for future maintainers.
* [bpo-16893](https://bugs.python.org/issue16893): Replace help.txt with help.html for Idle doc display. The new
  idlelib/help.html is rstripped Doc/build/html/library/idle.html. It looks
  better than help.txt and will better document Idle as released. The
  tkinter html viewer that works for this file was written by Mark Roseman.
  The now unused EditorWindow.HelpDialog class and helt.txt file are
  deprecated.
* [bpo-24199](https://bugs.python.org/issue24199): Deprecate unused idlelib.idlever with possible removal in 3.6.

  instead relying on OpenSSL source being configured and ready to build.
  The `PCbuild\build_ssl.py` script has been re-written and re-named to
  `PCbuild\prepare_ssl.py`, and takes care of configuring OpenSSL source
  for both 32 and 64 bit platforms. OpenSSL sources obtained from

* [bpo-21037](https://bugs.python.org/issue21037): Add a build option to enable AddressSanitizer support.
* [bpo-19962](https://bugs.python.org/issue19962): The Windows build process now creates âpython.batâ in the root

  ncursesw directory.
* [bpo-15234](https://bugs.python.org/issue15234): For BerkelyDB and Sqlite, only add the found library and

  PyObject\_Calloc(), \_PyObject\_GC\_Calloc(). bytes(int) is now using
  `calloc()` instead of `malloc()` for large objects which is faster and
  use less memory.
* [bpo-20942](https://bugs.python.org/issue20942): PyImport\_ImportFrozenModuleObject() no longer sets \_\_file\_\_ to
  match what importlib does; this affects \_frozen\_importlib as well as any

### Tools/Demos[Â¶](#id285 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-22314](https://bugs.python.org/issue22314): pydoc now works when the LINES environment variable is set.
* [bpo-22615](https://bugs.python.org/issue22615): Argument Clinic now supports the âtypeâ argument for the int
  converter. This permits using the int converter with enums and typedefs.
* [bpo-20076](https://bugs.python.org/issue20076): The makelocalealias.py script no longer ignores UTF-8 mapping.
* [bpo-20079](https://bugs.python.org/issue20079): The makelocalealias.py script now can parse the SUPPORTED file
  from glibc sources and supports command line options for source paths.

  extracts ZIP files with directory entries. Patch by Ryan Wilson.
* [bpo-22120](https://bugs.python.org/issue22120): For functions using an unsigned integer return converter,
  Argument Clinic now generates a cast to that type for the comparison to -1
  in the generated code. (This suppresses a compilation warning.)
* [bpo-18974](https://bugs.python.org/issue18974): Tools/scripts/diff.py now uses argparse instead of optparse.
* [bpo-21906](https://bugs.python.org/issue21906): Make Tools/scripts/md5sum.py work in Python 3. Patch by Zachary

  by Arfrever Frehtes Taifersar Arahesis.

### Windows[Â¶](#id286 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-23260](https://bugs.python.org/issue23260): Update Windows installer
* The bundled version of Tcl/Tk has been updated to 8.6.3. The most visible
  result of this change is the addition of new native file dialogs when
  running on Windows Vista or newer. See Tcl/Tkâs TIP 432 for more
  information. Also, this version of Tcl/Tk includes support for Windows
  10.
* [bpo-17896](https://bugs.python.org/issue17896): The Windows build scripts now expect external library sources
  to be in `PCbuild\..\externals` rather than `PCbuild\..\..`.
* [bpo-17717](https://bugs.python.org/issue17717): The Windows build scripts now use a copy of NASM pulled from
  svn.python.org to build OpenSSL.
* [bpo-21907](https://bugs.python.org/issue21907): Improved the batch scripts provided for building Python.
* [bpo-22644](https://bugs.python.org/issue22644): The bundled version of OpenSSL has been updated to 1.0.1j.
* [bpo-10747](https://bugs.python.org/issue10747): Use versioned labels in the Windows start menu. Patch by Olive
  Kilburn.

    difflib.IS_LINE_JUNK method. An attacker could use this flaw to
    cause denial of service.

CVE-2018-1000802

    Python Software Foundation Python (CPython) version 2.7 contains a
    CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a
    Command ('Command Injection') vulnerability in shutil module
    (make_archive function) that can result in Denial of service,
    Information gain via injection of arbitrary files on the system or
    entire drive. This attack appear to be exploitable via Passage of

[3.6] [bpo-32981](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32981): Fix catastrophic backtracking vulns ([GH-5955](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/5955))

* Prevent low-grade poplib REDOS ([CVE-2018-1060](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7hp6-577h-hcgr "CVE-2018-1060"))

The regex to test a mail server's timestamp is susceptible to
catastrophic backtracking on long evil responses from the server.

Happily, the maximum length of malicious inputs is 2K thanks
to a limit introduced in the fix for CVE-2013-1752.

A 2KB evil response from the mail server would result in small slowdowns
(milliseconds vs. microseconds) accumulated over many apop calls.
This is a potential DOS vector via accumulated slowdowns.

Replace it with a similar non-vulnerable regex.

The new regex is RFC compliant.
The old regex was non-compliant in edge cases.

* Prevent difflib REDOS ([CVE-2018-1061](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gf62-w85x-fjpv "CVE-2018-1061"))

The default regex for IS_LINE_JUNK is susceptible to
catastrophic backtracking.
This is a potential DOS vector.

Replace it with an equivalent non-vulnerable regex.

Also introduce unit and REDOS tests for difflib.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

* Prevent low-grade poplib REDOS ([CVE-2018-1060](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7hp6-577h-hcgr "CVE-2018-1060"))

The regex to test a mail server's timestamp is susceptible to
catastrophic backtracking on long evil responses from the server.

Happily, the maximum length of malicious inputs is 2K thanks
to a limit introduced in the fix for CVE-2013-1752.

A 2KB evil response from the mail server would result in small slowdowns
(milliseconds vs. microseconds) accumulated over many apop calls.
This is a potential DOS vector via accumulated slowdowns.

Replace it with a similar non-vulnerable regex.

The new regex is RFC compliant.
The old regex was non-compliant in edge cases.

* Prevent difflib REDOS ([CVE-2018-1061](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gf62-w85x-fjpv "CVE-2018-1061"))

The default regex for IS_LINE_JUNK is susceptible to
catastrophic backtracking.
This is a potential DOS vector.

Replace it with an equivalent non-vulnerable regex.

Also introduce unit and REDOS tests for difflib.

### Security[Â¶](#id10 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-32551](https://bugs.python.org/issue32551): The `sys.path[0]` initialization change for [bpo-29139](https://bugs.python.org/issue29139) caused
  a regression by revealing an inconsistency in how sys.path is initialized
  when executing `__main__` from a zipfile, directory, or other import
  location. This is considered a potential security issue, as it may lead to
  privileged processes unexpectedly loading code from user controlled
  directories in situations where that was not previously the case.

  The interpreter now consistently avoids ever adding the import locationâs
  parent directory to `sys.path`, and ensures no other `sys.path`
  entries are inadvertently modified when inserting the import location
  named on the command line. (Originally reported as [bpo-29723](https://bugs.python.org/issue29723) against
  Python 3.6rc1, but it was missed at the time that the then upcoming Python
  3.5.4 release would also be affected)

  + Identical objects will be saved only once.
  + Equal references will be load as identical objects.
  + Added support for saving and loading recursive data structures.
* [bpo-31170](https://bugs.python.org/issue31170): expat: Update libexpat from 2.2.3 to 2.2.4. Fix copying of

  CVE-2016-0718 (Fix regression bugs from 2.2.0âs fix to CVE-2016-0718) and
  CVE-2012-0876 (Counter hash flooding with SipHash). Note: the
  CVE-2016-5300 (Use os- specific entropy sources like getrandom) doesnât

  expat secret using `XML_SetHashSalt()`.
* [bpo-30500](https://bugs.python.org/issue30500): Fix urllib.parse.splithost() to correctly parse fragments. For

  Tiny values (such as 1e-6) are valid non-zero values for setitimer(),

  compiler issues.
* [bpo-26194](https://bugs.python.org/issue26194): Deque.insert() gave odd results for bounded deques that had

  with a null byte.
* [bpo-25462](https://bugs.python.org/issue25462): The hash of the key now is calculated only once in most
  operations in C implementation of OrderedDict.

  when compiling AST from Python objects.
* [bpo-24802](https://bugs.python.org/issue24802): Avoid buffer overreads when int(), float(), compile(), exec()
  and eval() are passed bytes-like objects. These objects are not
  necessarily terminated by a null byte, but the functions assumed they
  were.

  recursion limit is too low depending at the current recursion depth.
  Modify also the âlower-water markâ formula to make it monotonic. This mark
  is used to decide when the overflowed flag of the thread state is reset.

  function instead of the getentropy() function. The getentropy() function
  is blocking to generate very good quality entropy, os.urandom() doesnât
  need such high- quality entropy.
* [bpo-25182](https://bugs.python.org/issue25182): The stdprinter (used as sys.stderr before the io module is
  imported at startup) now uses the backslashreplace error handler.

  Py\_ssize\_t, but internally cap those sizes to UINT\_MAX. This resolves a
  regression in 3.5 where GzipFile.read() failed to read chunks larger than
  2 or 4 GiB. The change affects the zlib.Decompress.decompress()
  max\_length parameter, the zlib.decompress() bufsize parameter, and the
  zlib.Decompress.flush() length parameter.

  the existing asyncio create\_server method the reuseaddr option for
  datagram sockets defaults to True if the O/S is âposixâ (except if the
  platform is Cygwin). Patch by Chris Laws.
* [bpo-25304](https://bugs.python.org/issue25304): Add asyncio.run\_coroutine\_threadsafe(). This lets you submit a
  coroutine to a loop from another thread, returning a

  more understandable and correct.
* [bpo-25203](https://bugs.python.org/issue25203): Failed readline.set\_completer\_delims() no longer left the
  module in inconsistent state.
* [bpo-23600](https://bugs.python.org/issue23600): Default implementation of tzinfo.fromutc() was returning wrong
  results in some cases.
* [bpo-23329](https://bugs.python.org/issue23329): Allow the ssl module to be built with older versions of
  LibreSSL.
* Prevent overflow in \_Unpickler\_Read.
* [bpo-25047](https://bugs.python.org/issue25047): The XML encoding declaration written by Element Tree now

  EINVAL.
* [bpo-23517](https://bugs.python.org/issue23517): Fix rounding in fromtimestamp() and utcfromtimestamp() methods
  of datetime.datetime: microseconds are now rounded to nearest with ties
  going to nearest even integer (ROUND\_HALF\_EVEN), instead of being rounding
  towards minus infinity (ROUND\_FLOOR). Itâs important that these methods
  use the same rounding mode than datetime.timedelta to keep the property:
  (datetime(1970,1,1) + timedelta(seconds=t)) ==
  datetime.utcfromtimestamp(t). It also the rounding mode used by
  round(float) for example.
* [bpo-25155](https://bugs.python.org/issue25155): Fix datetime.datetime.now() and datetime.datetime.utcnow() on
  Windows to support date after year 2038. It was a regression introduced in
  Python 3.5.0.

* [bpo-24684](https://bugs.python.org/issue24684): socket.socket.getaddrinfo() now calls
  PyUnicode\_AsEncodedString() instead of calling the encode() method of the
  host, to handle correctly custom string with an encode() method which
  doesnât return a byte string. The encoder of the IDNA codec is now called
  directly instead of calling the encode() method of the string.
* [bpo-25060](https://bugs.python.org/issue25060): Correctly compute stack usage of the BUILD\_MAP opcode.
* [bpo-24857](https://bugs.python.org/issue24857): Comparing call\_args to a long sequence now correctly returns a
  boolean result instead of raising an exception. Patch by A Kaptur.

### IDLE[Â¶](#id55 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-15348](https://bugs.python.org/issue15348): Stop the debugger engine (normally in a user process) before
  closing the debugger window (running in the IDLE process). This prevents
  the RuntimeErrors that were being caught and ignored.
* [bpo-24455](https://bugs.python.org/issue24455): Prevent IDLE from hanging when a) closing the shell while the
  debugger is active (15347); b) closing the debugger with the [X] button
  (15348); and c) activating the debugger when already active (24455). The
  patch by Mark Roseman does this by making two changes. 1. Suspend and
  resume the gui.interaction method with the tcl vwait mechanism intended

* [bpo-23618](https://bugs.python.org/issue23618): [`socket.socket.connect()`](../library/socket.html#socket.socket.connect "socket.socket.connect") now waits until the connection
  completes instead of raising [`InterruptedError`](../library/exceptions.html#InterruptedError "InterruptedError") if the connection is
  interrupted by signals, signal handlers donât raise an exception and the
  socket is blocking or has a timeout. [`socket.socket.connect()`](../library/socket.html#socket.socket.connect "socket.socket.connect") still

  (empty) definition of the methoddef macro: itâs only generated once, even
  if Argument Clinic processes the same symbol multiple times, and itâs
  emitted at the end of all processing rather than immediately after the
  first use.

* [bpo-21141](https://bugs.python.org/issue21141): The Windows build process no longer attempts to find Perl,
  instead relying on OpenSSL source being configured and ready to build.
  The `PCbuild\build_ssl.py` script has been re-written and re-named to
  `PCbuild\prepare_ssl.py`, and takes care of configuring OpenSSL source
  for both 32 and 64 bit platforms. OpenSSL sources obtained from
  svn.python.org will always be pre-configured and ready to build.
* [bpo-21037](https://bugs.python.org/issue21037): Add a build option to enable AddressSanitizer support.
* [bpo-19962](https://bugs.python.org/issue19962): The Windows build process now creates âpython.batâ in the root

  ncursesw directory.
* [bpo-15234](https://bugs.python.org/issue15234): For BerkelyDB and Sqlite, only add the found library and

* [bpo-14203](https://bugs.python.org/issue14203): Remove obsolete support for view==NULL in PyBuffer\_FillInfo(),
  bytearray\_getbuffer(), bytesiobuf\_getbuffer() and array\_buffer\_getbuf().
  All functions now raise BufferError in that case.
* [bpo-22445](https://bugs.python.org/issue22445): PyBuffer\_IsContiguous() now implements precise contiguity
  tests, compatible with NumPyâs NPY\_RELAXED\_STRIDES\_CHECKING compilation

  these functions.
* [bpo-21233](https://bugs.python.org/issue21233): Add new C functions: PyMem\_RawCalloc(), PyMem\_Calloc(),
  PyObject\_Calloc(), \_PyObject\_GC\_Calloc(). bytes(int) is now using
  `calloc()` instead of `malloc()` for large objects which is faster and
  use less memory.
* [bpo-20942](https://bugs.python.org/issue20942): PyImport\_ImportFrozenModuleObject() no longer sets \_\_file\_\_ to
  match what importlib does; this affects \_frozen\_importlib as well as any
  module loaded using imp.init\_frozen().

* [bpo-20568](https://bugs.python.org/issue20568): The Windows installer now installs the unversioned `pip`
  command in addition to the versioned `pip3` and `pip3.4` commands.
* [bpo-20757](https://bugs.python.org/issue20757): The ensurepip helper for the Windows uninstaller now skips
  uninstalling pip (rather than failing) if the user has updated pip to a
  different version from the one bundled with ensurepip.

### Core and Builtins[Â¶](#id119 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-20625](https://bugs.python.org/issue20625): Parameter names in \_\_annotations\_\_ were not mangled properly.
  Discovered by Jonas Wielicki, patch by Yury Selivanov.

  type of the object.
* [bpo-20619](https://bugs.python.org/issue20619): Give the AST nodes of keyword-only arguments a column and line
  number.
* [bpo-20526](https://bugs.python.org/issue20526): Revert changes of [bpo-19466](https://bugs.python.org/issue19466) which introduces a regression:
  donât clear anymore the state of Python threads early during the Python
  shutdown.

### Library[Â¶](#id120 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-20710](https://bugs.python.org/issue20710): The pydoc summary line no longer displays the âselfâ parameter
  for bound methods.
* [bpo-20566](https://bugs.python.org/issue20566): Change asyncio.as\_completed() to use a Queue, to avoid O(N\*\*2)
  behavior.
* [bpo-20704](https://bugs.python.org/issue20704): Implement new debug API in asyncio. Add new methods
  BaseEventLoop.set\_debug() and BaseEventLoop.get\_debug(). Add support for
  setting âasyncio.tasks.\_DEBUGâ variable with âPYTHONASYNCIODEBUGâ
  environment variable.
* asyncio: Refactoring and fixes: BaseEventLoop.sock\_connect() raises an
  error if the address is not resolved; use \_\_slots\_\_ in Handle and
  TimerHandle; as\_completed() and wait() raise TypeError if the passed list
  of Futures is a single Future; call\_soon() and other âcall\_\*()â functions
  raise TypeError if the passed callback is a coroutine function;
  \_ProactorBasePipeTransport uses \_FlowControlMixin;
  WriteTransport.set\_write\_buffer\_size() calls \_maybe\_pause\_protocol() to
  consider pausing receiving if the watermark limits have changed; fix
  \_check\_resolved\_address() for IPv6 address; and other minor improvements,
  along with multiple documentation updates.
* [bpo-20684](https://bugs.python.org/issue20684): Fix inspect.getfullargspec() to not to follow \_\_wrapped\_\_

* [bpo-19744](https://bugs.python.org/issue19744): the ensurepip installation step now just prints a warning to
  stderr rather than failing outright if SSL/TLS is unavailable. This allows
  local installation of POSIX builds without SSL/TLS support.
* [bpo-20594](https://bugs.python.org/issue20594): Avoid name clash with the libc function posix\_close.

### Build[Â¶](#id121 "Permalink to this headline")

## Python 3.4.0 release candidate 1[Â¶](#python-3-4-0-release-candidate-1 "Permalink to this headline")

*Release date: 2014-02-10*

### Core and Builtins[Â¶](#id122 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-19255](https://bugs.python.org/issue19255): The builtins module is restored to initial value before
  cleaning other modules. The sys and builtins modules are cleaned last.
* [bpo-20588](https://bugs.python.org/issue20588): Make Python-ast.c C89 compliant.
* [bpo-20437](https://bugs.python.org/issue20437): Fixed 22 potential bugs when deleting object references.
* [bpo-20500](https://bugs.python.org/issue20500): Displaying an exception at interpreter shutdown no longer risks
  triggering an assertion failure in PyObject\_Str.
* [bpo-20538](https://bugs.python.org/issue20538): UTF-7 incremental decoder produced inconsistent string when
  input was truncated in BASE64 section.
* [bpo-20404](https://bugs.python.org/issue20404): io.TextIOWrapper (and hence the open() builtin) now uses the
  internal codec marking system added for [bpo-19619](https://bugs.python.org/issue19619) to throw LookupError
  for known non- text encodings at stream construction time. The existing
  output type checks remain in place to deal with unmarked third party
  codecs.
* [bpo-17162](https://bugs.python.org/issue17162): Add PyType\_GetSlot.
* [bpo-20162](https://bugs.python.org/issue20162): Fix an alignment issue in the siphash24() hash function which
  caused a crash on PowerPC 64-bit (ppc64).

### Library[Â¶](#id123 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-20530](https://bugs.python.org/issue20530): The signatures for slot builtins have been updated to reflect
  the fact that they only accept positional-only arguments.
* [bpo-20517](https://bugs.python.org/issue20517): Functions in the os module that accept two filenames now
  register both filenames in the exception on failure.
* [bpo-20563](https://bugs.python.org/issue20563): The ipaddress module API is now considered stable.
* [bpo-14983](https://bugs.python.org/issue14983): email.generator now always adds a line end after each MIME
  boundary marker, instead of doing so only when there is an epilogue. This
  fixes an RFC compliance bug and solves an issue with signed MIME parts.
* [bpo-20540](https://bugs.python.org/issue20540): Fix a performance regression (vs. Python 3.2) when layering a
  multiprocessing Connection over a TCP socket. For small payloads, Nagleâs
  algorithm would introduce idle delays before the entire transmission of a
  message.
* [bpo-16983](https://bugs.python.org/issue16983): the new email header parsing code will now decode encoded words
  that are (incorrectly) surrounded by quotes, and register a defect.
* [bpo-19772](https://bugs.python.org/issue19772): email.generator no longer mutates the message object when doing
  a down- transform from 8bit to 7bit CTEs.
* [bpo-20536](https://bugs.python.org/issue20536): the statistics module now correctly handle Decimal instances
  with positive exponents
* [bpo-18805](https://bugs.python.org/issue18805): the netmask/hostmask parsing in ipaddress now more reliably
  filters out illegal values and correctly allows any valid prefix length.
* [bpo-20481](https://bugs.python.org/issue20481): For at least Python 3.4, the statistics module will require
  that all inputs for a single operation be of a single consistent type, or
  else a mixed of ints and a single other consistent type. This avoids some
  interoperability issues that arose with the previous approach of coercing
  to a suitable common type.
* [bpo-20478](https://bugs.python.org/issue20478): the statistics module now treats collections.Counter inputs
  like any other iterable.
* [bpo-17369](https://bugs.python.org/issue17369): get\_filename was raising an exception if the filename
  parameterâs RFC2231 encoding was broken in certain ways. This was a
  regression relative to python2.
* [bpo-20013](https://bugs.python.org/issue20013): Some imap servers disconnect if the current mailbox is deleted,
  and imaplib did not handle that case gracefully. Now it handles the âbyeâ
  correctly.
* [bpo-20531](https://bugs.python.org/issue20531): Revert 3.4 version of fix for #19063, and apply the 3.3
  version. That is, do *not* raise an error if unicode is passed to
  email.message.Message.set\_payload.
* [bpo-20476](https://bugs.python.org/issue20476): If a non-compat32 policy is used with any of the email parsers,
  EmailMessage is now used as the factory class. The factory class should
  really come from the policy; that will get fixed in 3.5.
* [bpo-19920](https://bugs.python.org/issue19920): TarFile.list() no longer fails when outputs a listing
  containing non- encodable characters. Based on patch by Vajrasky Kok.
* [bpo-20515](https://bugs.python.org/issue20515): Fix NULL pointer dereference introduced by [bpo-20368](https://bugs.python.org/issue20368).
* [bpo-19186](https://bugs.python.org/issue19186): Restore namespacing of expat symbols inside the pyexpat module.
* [bpo-20053](https://bugs.python.org/issue20053): ensurepip (and hence venv) are no longer affected by the
  settings in the default pip configuration file.
* [bpo-20426](https://bugs.python.org/issue20426): When passing the re.DEBUG flag, re.compile() displays the debug
  output every time it is called, regardless of the compilation cache.
* [bpo-20368](https://bugs.python.org/issue20368): The null character now correctly passed from Tcl to Python.
  Improved error handling in variables-related commands.
* [bpo-20435](https://bugs.python.org/issue20435): Fix \_pyio.StringIO.getvalue() to take into account newline
  translation settings.
* tracemalloc: Fix slicing traces and fix slicing a traceback.
* [bpo-20354](https://bugs.python.org/issue20354): Fix an alignment issue in the tracemalloc module on 64-bit
  platforms. Bug seen on 64-bit Linux when using âmake profile-optâ.
* [bpo-17159](https://bugs.python.org/issue17159): inspect.signature now accepts duck types of functions, which
  adds support for Cython functions. Initial patch by Stefan Behnel.
* [bpo-18801](https://bugs.python.org/issue18801): Fix inspect.classify\_class\_attrs to correctly classify
  object.\_\_new\_\_ and object.\_\_init\_\_.
* Fixed cmath.isinfâs name in its argument parsing code.
* [bpo-20311](https://bugs.python.org/issue20311): poll and epoll now round the timeout away from zero, instead of
  rounding towards zero, in select and selectors modules:
  select.epoll.poll(), selectors.PollSelector.poll() and
  selectors.EpollSelector.poll(). For example, a timeout of one microsecond
  (1e-6) is now rounded to one millisecondi (1e-3), instead of being rounded
  to zero. However, the granularity property and asyncioâs resolution
  feature were removed again. (See also: [bpo-20452](https://bugs.python.org/issue20452))
* asyncio: Some refactoring; various fixes; add write flow control to unix
  pipes; Future.set\_exception() instantiates the exception argument if it is
  a class; improved proactor pipe transport; support wait\_for(f, None);
  donât log broken/disconnected pipes; use ValueError instead of assert for
  forbidden subprocess\_{shell,exec} arguments; added a convenience API for
  subprocess management; added StreamReader.at\_eof(); properly handle
  duplicate coroutines/futures in gather(), wait(), as\_completed(); use a
  bytearray for buffering in StreamReader; and more.
* [bpo-20288](https://bugs.python.org/issue20288): fix handling of invalid numeric charrefs in HTMLParser.
* [bpo-20424](https://bugs.python.org/issue20424): Python implementation of io.StringIO now supports lone
  surrogates.
* [bpo-20308](https://bugs.python.org/issue20308): inspect.signature now works on classes without user-defined
  \_\_init\_\_ or \_\_new\_\_ methods.
* [bpo-20372](https://bugs.python.org/issue20372): inspect.getfile (and a bunch of other inspect functions that
  use it) doesnât crash with unexpected AttributeError on classes defined in
  C without \_\_module\_\_.
* [bpo-20356](https://bugs.python.org/issue20356): inspect.signature formatting uses â/â to separate
  positional-only parameters from others.
* [bpo-20223](https://bugs.python.org/issue20223): inspect.signature now supports methods defined with
  functools.partialmethods.
* [bpo-19456](https://bugs.python.org/issue19456): ntpath.join() now joins relative paths correctly when a drive
  is present.
* [bpo-19077](https://bugs.python.org/issue19077): tempfile.TemporaryDirectory cleanup no longer fails when called
  during shutdown. Emitting resource warning in \_\_del\_\_ no longer fails.
  Original patch by Antoine Pitrou.
* [bpo-20394](https://bugs.python.org/issue20394): Silence Coverity warning in audioop module.
* [bpo-20367](https://bugs.python.org/issue20367): Fix behavior of concurrent.futures.as\_completed() for duplicate
  arguments. Patch by Glenn Langford.
* [bpo-8260](https://bugs.python.org/issue8260): The read(), readline() and readlines() methods of
  codecs.StreamReader returned incomplete data when were called after
  readline() or read(size). Based on patch by Amaury Forgeot dâArc.
* [bpo-20105](https://bugs.python.org/issue20105): the codec exception chaining now correctly sets the traceback
  of the original exception as its \_\_traceback\_\_ attribute.
* [bpo-17481](https://bugs.python.org/issue17481): inspect.getfullargspec() now uses inspect.signature() API.
* [bpo-15304](https://bugs.python.org/issue15304): concurrent.futures.wait() can block forever even if Futures
  have completed. Patch by Glenn Langford.
* [bpo-14455](https://bugs.python.org/issue14455): plistlib: fix serializing integers in the range of an unsigned
  long long but outside of the range of signed long long for binary plist
  files.

### IDLE[Â¶](#id124 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-20406](https://bugs.python.org/issue20406): Use Python application icons for Idle window title bars. Patch
  mostly by Serhiy Storchaka.
* Update the python.gif icon for the Idle classbrowser and pathbowser from
  the old green snake to the new blue and yellow snakes.
* [bpo-17721](https://bugs.python.org/issue17721): Remove non-functional configuration dialog help button until we
  make it actually gives some help when clicked. Patch by Guilherme SimÃµes.

### Tests[Â¶](#id125 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-20532](https://bugs.python.org/issue20532): Tests which use \_testcapi now are marked as CPython only.
* [bpo-19920](https://bugs.python.org/issue19920): Added tests for TarFile.list(). Based on patch by Vajrasky
  Kok.

  Popa.
* [bpo-20474](https://bugs.python.org/issue20474): Fix test\_socket âunexpected successâ failures on OS X 10.7+.

### Tools/Demos[Â¶](#id126 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-20530](https://bugs.python.org/issue20530): Argument Clinicâs signature format has been revised again. The
  new syntax is highly human readable while still preventing false
  positives. The syntax also extends Python syntax to denote âselfâ and
  positional-only parameters, allowing inspect.Signature objects to be
  totally accurate for all supported builtins in Python 3.4.
* [bpo-20456](https://bugs.python.org/issue20456): Argument Clinic now observes the C preprocessor conditional
  compilation statements of the C files it parses. When a Clinic block is
  inside a conditional code, it adjusts its output to match, including
  automatically generating an empty methoddef macro.
* [bpo-20456](https://bugs.python.org/issue20456): Cloned functions in Argument Clinic now use the correct name,
  not the name of the function they were cloned from, for text strings
  inside generated code.
* [bpo-20456](https://bugs.python.org/issue20456): Fixed Argument Clinicâs test suite and ââconvertersâ feature.
* [bpo-20456](https://bugs.python.org/issue20456): Argument Clinic now allows specifying different names for a
  parameter in Python and C, using âasâ on the parameter line.
* [bpo-20326](https://bugs.python.org/issue20326): Argument Clinic now uses a simple, unique signature to annotate
  text signatures in docstrings, resulting in fewer false positives. âselfâ
  parameters are also explicitly marked, allowing inspect.Signature() to
  authoritatively detect (and skip) said parameters.
* [bpo-20326](https://bugs.python.org/issue20326): Argument Clinic now generates separate checksums for the input
  and output sections of the block, allowing external tools to verify that
  the input has not changed (and thus the output is not out-of-date).

### Build[Â¶](#id127 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-20465](https://bugs.python.org/issue20465): Update SQLite shipped with OS X installer to 3.8.3.

### C API[Â¶](#id128 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-20517](https://bugs.python.org/issue20517): Added new functions allowing OSError exceptions to reference
  two filenames instead of one: PyErr\_SetFromErrnoWithFilenameObjects() and
  PyErr\_SetExcFromWindowsErrWithFilenameObjects().

### Documentation[Â¶](#id129 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-20488](https://bugs.python.org/issue20488): Change wording to say importlib is *the* implementation of
  import instead of just *an* implementation.
* [bpo-6386](https://bugs.python.org/issue6386): Clarify in the tutorial that specifying a symlink to execute
  means the directory containing the executed script and not the symlink is
  added to sys.path.

## Python 3.4.0 beta 3[Â¶](#python-3-4-0-beta-3 "Permalink to this headline")

*Release date: 2014-01-26*

### Core and Builtins[Â¶](#id130 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-20189](https://bugs.python.org/issue20189): Four additional builtin types (PyTypeObject,
  PyMethodDescr\_Type, \_PyMethodWrapper\_Type, and PyWrapperDescr\_Type) have
  been modified to provide introspection information for builtins.
* [bpo-17825](https://bugs.python.org/issue17825): Cursor â^â is correctly positioned for SyntaxError and
  IndentationError.
* [bpo-2382](https://bugs.python.org/issue2382): SyntaxError cursor â^â is now written at correct position in
  most cases when multibyte characters are in line (before â^â). This still
  not works correctly with wide East Asian characters.
* [bpo-18960](https://bugs.python.org/issue18960): The first line of Python script could be executed twice when
  the source encoding was specified on the second line. Now the source
  encoding declaration on the second line isnât effective if the first line
  contains anything except a comment. âpython -xâ works now again with
  files with the source encoding declarations, and can be used to make
  Python batch files on Windows.

### Library[Â¶](#id131 "Permalink to this headline")

* asyncio: Various improvements and small changes not all covered by issues
  listed below. E.g. wait\_for() now cancels the inner task if the timeout

  it could get an inspect.Signature is a callable written in Python. Fix
  courtesy of Michael Foord.
* [bpo-20317](https://bugs.python.org/issue20317): ExitStack.\_\_exit\_\_ could create a self-referential loop if an
  exception raised by a cleanup operation already had its context set
  correctly (for example, by the @contextmanager decorator). The infinite
  loop this caused is now avoided by checking if the expected context is
  already set before trying to fix it.
* [bpo-20374](https://bugs.python.org/issue20374): Fix build with GNU readline >= 6.3.
* [bpo-20262](https://bugs.python.org/issue20262): Warnings are raised now when duplicate names are added in the

  a help on environment with too small COLUMNS. Based on patch by Elazar
  Gershuni.
* [bpo-20207](https://bugs.python.org/issue20207): Always disable SSLv2 except when PROTOCOL\_SSLv2 is explicitly
  asked for.
* [bpo-18960](https://bugs.python.org/issue18960): The tokenize module now ignore the source encoding declaration
  on the second line if the first line contains anything except a comment.
* [bpo-20078](https://bugs.python.org/issue20078): Reading malformed zipfiles no longer hangs with 100% CPU
  consumption.

  error instead of returning -1.
* [bpo-19719](https://bugs.python.org/issue19719): Make importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder.find\_module(),
  PathEntryFinder.find\_loader(), and Loader.load\_module() use PEP 451 APIs
  to help with backwards-compatibility.

* [bpo-20229](https://bugs.python.org/issue20229): Avoid plistlib deprecation warning in platform.mac\_ver().
* [bpo-14455](https://bugs.python.org/issue14455): Fix some problems with the new binary plist support in
  plistlib.

### IDLE[Â¶](#id132 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-17390](https://bugs.python.org/issue17390): Add Python version to Idle editor window title bar. Original

  non-integer input; reworded docs to clarify that an integer type should
  define both \_\_int\_\_ and \_\_index\_\_.
* [bpo-19787](https://bugs.python.org/issue19787): PyThread\_set\_key\_value() now always set the value. In Python
  3.3, the function did nothing if the key already exists (if the current
  value is a non-NULL pointer).
* [bpo-14432](https://bugs.python.org/issue14432): Remove the thread state field from the frame structure. Fix a
  crash when a generator is created in a C thread that is destroyed while
  the generator is still used. The issue was that a generator contains a
  frame, and the frame kept a reference to the Python state of the destroyed
  C thread. The crash occurs when a trace function is setup.
* [bpo-19576](https://bugs.python.org/issue19576): PyGILState\_Ensure() now initializes threads. At startup, Python
  has no concrete GIL. If PyGILState\_Ensure() is called from a new thread

  methods.
* [bpo-19744](https://bugs.python.org/issue19744): ensurepip now provides a better error message when Python is
  built without SSL/TLS support (pip currently requires that support to run,
  even if only operating with local wheel files)
* [bpo-19734](https://bugs.python.org/issue19734): ensurepip now ignores all pip environment variables to avoid
  odd behaviour based on user configuration settings

  Original patch by Simon Sapin.
* [bpo-19946](https://bugs.python.org/issue19946): multiprocessing now uses runpy to initialize \_\_main\_\_ in child
  processes when necessary, allowing it to correctly handle scripts without
  suffixes and submodules that use explicit relative imports or otherwise
  rely on parent modules being correctly imported prior to execution.
* [bpo-19921](https://bugs.python.org/issue19921): When Path.mkdir() is called with parents=True, any missing
  parent is created with the default permissions, ignoring the mode argument
  (mimicking the POSIX âmkdir -pâ command).
* [bpo-19887](https://bugs.python.org/issue19887): Improve the Path.resolve() algorithm to support certain symlink
  chains.
* [bpo-19912](https://bugs.python.org/issue19912): Fixed numerous bugs in ntpath.splitunc().

  respects the -f and -q flags instead of ignoring them.
* [bpo-19623](https://bugs.python.org/issue19623): Fixed writing to unseekable files in the aifc module.
* [bpo-19946](https://bugs.python.org/issue19946): multiprocessing.spawn now raises ImportError when the module to

  would generate a message claiming the Content-Transfer-Encoding was 7bit,
  and produce garbage output for the content. This now works. A couple of
  other set\_payload mishandlings of non-ASCII are also fixed. In addition,
  calling set\_payload with a string argument without specifying a charset
  now raises an error (this is a new error in 3.4).
* [bpo-15475](https://bugs.python.org/issue15475): Add \_\_sizeof\_\_ implementations for itertools objects.

  encoding with the surrogateescape error handler, instead of decoding from
  the locale encoding in strict mode. It fixes the function on Fedora 19
  which is probably the first major distribution release with a non-ASCII
  name. Patch written by Toshio Kuratomi.
* [bpo-19343](https://bugs.python.org/issue19343): Expose FreeBSD-specific APIs in resource module. Original
  patch by Koobs.
* [bpo-19929](https://bugs.python.org/issue19929): Call os.read with 32768 within subprocess.Popen.communicate
  rather than 4096 for efficiency. A microbenchmark shows Linux and OS X
  both using ~50% less cpu time this way.
* [bpo-19506](https://bugs.python.org/issue19506): Use a memoryview to avoid a data copy when piping data to stdin

  large bytes string (i.e., with size greater than 2\*\*32-1).
* [bpo-19138](https://bugs.python.org/issue19138): doctestâs IGNORE\_EXCEPTION\_DETAIL now allows a match when no
  exception detail exists (no colon following the exceptionâs name, or a
  colon does follow but no text follows the colon).
* [bpo-19927](https://bugs.python.org/issue19927): Add \_\_eq\_\_ to path-based loaders in importlib.

*Release date: 2013-11-24*

### Core and Builtins[Â¶](#id143 "Permalink to this headline")

* Use the repr of a module name in more places in import, especially
  exceptions.
* [bpo-19619](https://bugs.python.org/issue19619): str.encode, bytes.decode and bytearray.decode now use an
  internal API to throw LookupError for known non-text encodings, rather
  than attempting the encoding or decoding operation and then throwing a
  TypeError for an unexpected output type. (The latter mechanism remains in
  place for third party non-text encodings)
* [bpo-19183](https://bugs.python.org/issue19183): Implement PEP 456 âsecure and interchangeable hash algorithmâ.
  Python now uses SipHash24 on all major platforms.
* [bpo-12892](https://bugs.python.org/issue12892): The utf-16\* and utf-32\* encoders no longer allow surrogate code
  points (U+D800-U+DFFF) to be encoded. The utf-32\* decoders no longer
  decode byte sequences that correspond to surrogate code points. The
  surrogatepass error handler now works with the utf-16\* and utf-32\* codecs.
  Based on patches by Victor Stinner and Kang-Hao (Kenny) Lu.
* [bpo-17806](https://bugs.python.org/issue17806): Added keyword-argument support for âtabsizeâ to

  bytearray.decode() now direct users to codecs.encode() or codecs.decode()
  as appropriate.
* [bpo-17828](https://bugs.python.org/issue17828): The interpreter now attempts to chain errors that occur in
  codec processing with a replacement exception of the same type that
  includes the codec name in the error message. It ensures it only does this
  when the creation of the replacement exception wonât lose any information.
* [bpo-19466](https://bugs.python.org/issue19466): Clear the frames of daemon threads earlier during the Python
  shutdown to call object destructors. So âunclosed fileâ resource warnings
  are now correctly emitted for daemon threads.

### Tools/Demos[Â¶](#id148 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-19730](https://bugs.python.org/issue19730): Argument Clinic now supports all the existing PyArg âformat
  unitsâ as legacy converters, as well as two new features: âself

  importlib.machinery.FileFinder no longer special-cases ââ to â.â. This
  leads to modules imported from cwd to now possess an absolute file path
  for \_\_file\_\_ (this does not affect modules specified by path on the CLI
  but it does affect -m/runpy). It also allows FileFinder to be more
  consistent by not having an edge case.

* [bpo-19199](https://bugs.python.org/issue19199): Remove `PyThreadState.tick_counter` field
* Fix macro expansion of \_PyErr\_OCCURRED(), and make sure to use it in at

  programs that may be accessing the maildir directory.
* [bpo-14984](https://bugs.python.org/issue14984): On POSIX systems, when netrc is called without a filename
  argument (and therefore is reading the userâs $HOME/.netrc file), it now
  enforces the same security rules as typical ftp clients: the .netrc file
  must be owned by the user that owns the process and must not be readable

| I created [bpo-32981](https://bugs.python.org/issue32981) for this problem.  I skimmed through the git log. Commit messages for security seem to follow the 'XXX (CVE-...)' format rather than the 'bpo-XXX: ...' format. Let me know if I should change the commit messages though. |

Timing test is very fragile. It can fail randomly when tests are paused for some reasons. I suggest to remove the timing test and increase the size of input so that it would take a hour with non-fixed code.

Then the test will pass if you wait long enough. Since the test suite already takes a long time to run and does so in parallel (so one hanging test might not be visible), this seems undesirable to me. Thoughts?

Why not just

```
self.assertTrue(difflib.IS_LINE_JUNK(line))

```

?

And you can add the second argument of `assertTrue()` for getting more information if the test fails:

```
self.assertTrue(difflib.IS_LINE_JUNK(line), rept(line))

```

But don't do this in test\_is\_line\_junk\_REDOS.

Sorry, something went wrong.

You can use a special helper `swap_attr()` for temporary setting the attribute:

```
with test.support.swap_attr(self.client, 'welcome', evil_welcome):
```

The reason for the poor choices of asserts is that I didn't know what asserts are available and made do with what I could find. I really appreciate your help.

<https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#test-cases>

`assertRaises()` can be used as a function:

```
self.assertRaises(poplib.error_proto, self.client.apop, 'foo', 'dummypassword')
```

or as a context manager:

```
with self.assertRaises(poplib.error_proto):
    self.client.apop('foo', 'dummypassword')
```

The regex to test a mail server's timestamp is susceptible to
catastrophic backtracking on long evil responses from the server.

Happily, the maximum length of malicious inputs is 2K thanks
to a limit introduced in the fix for CVE-2013-1752.

A 2KB evil response from the mail server would result in small slowdowns
(milliseconds vs. microseconds) accumulated over many apop calls.
This is a potential DOS vector via accumulated slowdowns.

Replace it with a similar non-vulnerable regex.

The length of this line exceeds the 79 character limit allowed by [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#maximum-line-length).

And since testing strings contain spaces it is hard to distinguish the following cases:

```
should not be junk: abc #

```

and

```
should not be junk: abc #

```

This is why I suggested `repr()`.

Didn't realize this was being enforced, there are other lines over this limit as well. Will do.

Got it, I misread that as rept earlier and couldn't understand what you meant.

* Prevent low-grade poplib REDOS (CVE-2018-1060)

The regex to test a mail server's timestamp is susceptible to
catastrophic backtracking on long evil responses from the server.

Happily, the maximum length of malicious inputs is 2K thanks
to a limit introduced in the fix for CVE-2013-1752.

A 2KB evil response from the mail server would result in small slowdowns
(milliseconds vs. microseconds) accumulated over many apop calls.
This is a potential DOS vector via accumulated slowdowns.

Replace it with a similar non-vulnerable regex.

The new regex is RFC compliant.
The old regex was non-compliant in edge cases.

* Prevent difflib REDOS (CVE-2018-1061)

The default regex for IS_LINE_JUNK is susceptible to
catastrophic backtracking.
This is a potential DOS vector.

Replace it with an equivalent non-vulnerable regex.

Also introduce unit and REDOS tests for difflib.

* Prevent low-grade poplib REDOS (CVE-2018-1060)

The regex to test a mail server's timestamp is susceptible to
catastrophic backtracking on long evil responses from the server.

Happily, the maximum length of malicious inputs is 2K thanks
to a limit introduced in the fix for CVE-2013-1752.

A 2KB evil response from the mail server would result in small slowdowns
(milliseconds vs. microseconds) accumulated over many apop calls.
This is a potential DOS vector via accumulated slowdowns.

Replace it with a similar non-vulnerable regex.

The new regex is RFC compliant.
The old regex was non-compliant in edge cases.

* Prevent difflib REDOS (CVE-2018-1061)

The default regex for IS_LINE_JUNK is susceptible to
catastrophic backtracking.
This is a potential DOS vector.

Replace it with an equivalent non-vulnerable regex.

Also introduce unit and REDOS tests for difflib.

* Prevent low-grade poplib REDOS (CVE-2018-1060)

The regex to test a mail server's timestamp is susceptible to
catastrophic backtracking on long evil responses from the server.

Happily, the maximum length of malicious inputs is 2K thanks
to a limit introduced in the fix for CVE-2013-1752.

A 2KB evil response from the mail server would result in small slowdowns
(milliseconds vs. microseconds) accumulated over many apop calls.
This is a potential DOS vector via accumulated slowdowns.

Replace it with a similar non-vulnerable regex.

The new regex is RFC compliant.
The old regex was non-compliant in edge cases.

* Prevent difflib REDOS (CVE-2018-1061)

The default regex for IS_LINE_JUNK is susceptible to
catastrophic backtracking.
This is a potential DOS vector.

Replace it with an equivalent non-vulnerable regex.

Also introduce unit and REDOS tests for difflib.

When are those going to be fixed?](#cve-severity-assessment)- [What does local (remote) mean?](#localremote)

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

[bpo-32981](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32981): Fix catastrophic backtracking vulns ([#5955](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/5955))

* Prevent low-grade poplib REDOS ([CVE-2018-1060](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7hp6-577h-hcgr "CVE-2018-1060"))

The regex to test a mail server's timestamp is susceptible to
catastrophic backtracking on long evil responses from the server.

Happily, the maximum length of malicious inputs is 2K thanks
to a limit introduced in the fix for CVE-2013-1752.

A 2KB evil response from the mail server would result in small slowdowns
(milliseconds vs. microseconds) accumulated over many apop calls.
This is a potential DOS vector via accumulated slowdowns.

Replace it with a similar non-vulnerable regex.

The new regex is RFC compliant.
The old regex was non-compliant in edge cases.

* Prevent difflib REDOS ([CVE-2018-1061](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gf62-w85x-fjpv "CVE-2018-1061"))

The default regex for IS_LINE_JUNK is susceptible to
catastrophic backtracking.
This is a potential DOS vector.

Replace it with an equivalent non-vulnerable regex.

Also introduce unit and REDOS tests for difflib.

* Prevent low-grade poplib REDOS ([CVE-2018-1060](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7hp6-577h-hcgr "CVE-2018-1060"))

The regex to test a mail server's timestamp is susceptible to
catastrophic backtracking on long evil responses from the server.

Happily, the maximum length of malicious inputs is 2K thanks
to a limit introduced in the fix for CVE-2013-1752.

A 2KB evil response from the mail server would result in small slowdowns
(milliseconds vs. microseconds) accumulated over many apop calls.
This is a potential DOS vector via accumulated slowdowns.

Replace it with a similar non-vulnerable regex.

The new regex is RFC compliant.
The old regex was non-compliant in edge cases.

* Prevent difflib REDOS ([CVE-2018-1061](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gf62-w85x-fjpv "CVE-2018-1061"))

The default regex for IS_LINE_JUNK is susceptible to
catastrophic backtracking.
This is a potential DOS vector.

Replace it with an equivalent non-vulnerable regex.

Also introduce unit and REDOS tests for difflib.

| ``` Hi Python security team,  My name is James Davis. I'm a security researcher at Virginia Tech.  The python core (cpython) has 2 regular expressions vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking that look like potential DOS vectors. The vulnerable expressions are listed below.  Each vulnerability has the following keys, explained in more detail below:  - pattern  - filesIn (as of December/January; I excluded any appearances in irrelevant-looking dirs, and in '.min' files)  - stringLenFor10Sec  - nPumpsFor10Sec  - attackFormat  - blowupCurve  The attack format describes how to generate an attack string. On my machine, an attack string generated using nPumpsFor10Sec repetitions ("pumps") of the pump string(s) blocks the python regex engine for 10 seconds, though this will vary based on your hardware.  Compose an attack string like this:   'prefix 1' + 'pump 1' X times + 'prefix 2' + 'pump 2' X times + ... + suffix Example:   With pumpPairs: [{'prefix': 'a', 'pump': 'b'}], suffix: 'c', an attack string with three pumps would be:     abbbc  Catastrophic backtracking blows up at either an exponential rate or a super-linear (power law) rate. The blowupCurve indicates how severe the blow-up is. The 'type' is either EXP(onential) or POW(er law) in the number of pumps (x). The 'parms' are the parameters for the two curve types.

* Prevent low-grade poplib REDOS ([CVE-2018-1060](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7hp6-577h-hcgr "CVE-2018-1060"))

The regex to test a mail server's timestamp is susceptible to
catastrophic backtracking on long evil responses from the server.

Happily, the maximum length of malicious inputs is 2K thanks
to a limit introduced in the fix for CVE-2013-1752.

A 2KB evil response from the mail server would result in small slowdowns
(milliseconds vs. microseconds) accumulated over many apop calls.
This is a potential DOS vector via accumulated slowdowns.

Replace it with a similar non-vulnerable regex.

The new regex is RFC compliant.
The old regex was non-compliant in edge cases.

* Prevent difflib REDOS ([CVE-2018-1061](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gf62-w85x-fjpv "CVE-2018-1061"))

The default regex for IS_LINE_JUNK is susceptible to
catastrophic backtracking.
This is a potential DOS vector.

Replace it with an equivalent non-vulnerable regex.

Also introduce unit and REDOS tests for difflib.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-4306-1                   security@debian.org
<https://www.debian.org/security/>                       Moritz Muehlenhoff
September 27, 2018                    <https://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : python2.7
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-1060 CVE-2018-1061 CVE-2018-14647
                 CVE-2018-1000802

Multiple security issues were discovered in Python: ElementTree failed
to initialise Expat's hash salt, two denial of service issues were found
in difflib and poplib and the shutil module was affected by a command
injection vulnerability.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.7.13-2+deb9u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your python2.7 packages.

For the detailed security status of python2.7 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/python2.7>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://www.debian.org/security/>

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1579432#c0)  Bill Nottingham    2018-05-17 15:52:44 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  Python < 2.7.12 has a bug in its semaphore code that leads to errors when used with pid namespaces.  See: <https://bugs.python.org/issue24303>  This was fixed in 2.7.12 and 3.x, but RHEL 7 python still has this bug.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  2.7.5-68.el7.x86_64  How reproducible: 100%  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Run the following script  ... #!/bin/sh  for i in `seq 1 50`; do   bwrap --unshare-uts --unshare-ipc --unshare-pid --proc /proc --dev-bind / / python -c "for i in range(500): import multiprocessing; print multiprocessing.Queue()" & done | grep --line-buffered OSError ...  Actual results:  a smattering of:  ``` Traceback (most recent call last):   File "<string>", line 1, in <module>   File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/multiprocessing/__init__.py", line 218, in Queue     return Queue(maxsize)   File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/multiprocessing/queues.py", line 68, in __init__     self._wlock = Lock()   File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/multiprocessing/synchronize.py", line 147, in __init__     SemLock.__init__(self, SEMAPHORE, 1, 1)   File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/multiprocessing/synchronize.py", line 75, in __init__     sl = self._semlock = _multiprocessing.SemLock(kind, value, maxvalue) OSError: [Errno 17] File exists ```  Expected results:  no errors  Additional info:  This is breaking Ansible Tower with a number of RHEL customers.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1579432#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-10-30 07:55:14 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1749839#c0)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-09-06 14:42:08 UTC  ``` Python module `email` wrongly parses email addresses that contain multiple "@" character. An application that uses the `email` module and implements some kind of checks on the From/To headers of an email could be tricked into accepting an email address that should be denied.  Upstream issue: <https://bugs.python.org/issue34155>  Upstream patches: <https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/8cb65d1381b027f0b09ee36bfed7f35bb4dec9a9> [master branch] <https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/217077440a6938a0b428f67cfef6e053c4f8673c> [3.8] <https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/c48d606adcef395e59fd555496c42203b01dd3e8> [3.7] <https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/13a19139b5e76175bc95294d54afc9425e4f36c9> [3.6]   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1749839#c1)  Miro Hrončok    2019-09-09 09:03:02 UTC  ``` I've got automatically CCed to this bug as one of the Fedora's Python Maintainers yet I cannot see the blocked [bz1748207](show_bug.cgi?id=1748207).

They do not return any error value or raise any exception, thus making it impossible for the users of those functions to know if something was wrong.  When an application uses the `email` python module to parse an email address, the wrong output of the vulnerable functions may be used to trick the application to use wrong values and impact the Confidentiality, Integrity and/or Availability of a system.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1749839#c8)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-09-10 08:58:21 UTC  ``` In reply to [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1749839#c6): > BTW python37 is also packaged in Fedora.

I think you can fix it there without a security tracker from us. If you do need one, though, I will create it.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1749839#c11)  Miro Hrončok    2019-09-10 09:42:36 UTC  ``` I know we can fix it there without a security tracker from you.

I have create a tracker for fedora-rawhide/python37. We prefer to create separate trackers for each python version as they are separate packages and that way it is easier to track which versions are affected or not.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1749839#c20)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-11-06 09:45:32 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.7 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2019:3725 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3725](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A3725)   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1749839#c21)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-11-06 12:51:15 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

* Prevent low-grade poplib REDOS ([CVE-2018-1060](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7hp6-577h-hcgr "CVE-2018-1060"))

The regex to test a mail server's timestamp is susceptible to
catastrophic backtracking on long evil responses from the server.

Happily, the maximum length of malicious inputs is 2K thanks
to a limit introduced in the fix for CVE-2013-1752.

A 2KB evil response from the mail server would result in small slowdowns
(milliseconds vs. microseconds) accumulated over many apop calls.
This is a potential DOS vector via accumulated slowdowns.

Replace it with a similar non-vulnerable regex.

The new regex is RFC compliant.
The old regex was non-compliant in edge cases.

* Prevent difflib REDOS ([CVE-2018-1061](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gf62-w85x-fjpv "CVE-2018-1061"))

The default regex for IS_LINE_JUNK is susceptible to
catastrophic backtracking.
This is a potential DOS vector.

Replace it with an equivalent non-vulnerable regex.

Also introduce unit and REDOS tests for difflib.

| ``` The proposed PR fixes jumping from "with" block. Currently the exit function is left on the stack.

# CVE-2017-18207

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2017-18206.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2017-18208.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2017-18207 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-18207)

#### Description

\*\* DISPUTED \*\* The Wave\_read.\_read\_fmt\_chunk function in Lib/wave.py in Python through 3.6.4 does not ensure a nonzero channel value, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (divide-by-zero and exception) via a crafted wav format audio file. NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue because Python applications "need to be prepared to handle a wide variety of exceptions."

## Details

USN-3817-1 fixed a vulnerability in Python. This update provides

the corresponding update for Ubuntu 12.04 ESM.

Original advisory details:

It was discovered that Python incorrectly handled large amounts of data. A

remote attacker could use this issue to cause Python to crash, resulting in

a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-1000030](/security/CVE-2018-1000030))

It was discovered that Python incorrectly handled running external commands

in the shutil module. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause

Python to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-1000802](/security/CVE-2018-1000802))

It was discovered that Python incorrectly used regular expressions

vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking. A remote attacker could possibly

use this issue to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-1060](/security/CVE-2018-1060), [CVE-2018-1061](/security/CVE-2018-1061))

It was discovered that Python failed to initialize Expat's hash salt. A

remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause hash collisions,

leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-14647](/security/CVE-2018-14647))

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2020

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 334 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [January 2020 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2627487.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <http://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2020verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle E-Business Suite Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 23 new security patches for the Oracle E-Business Suite.  21 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpujan2020verbose.html#EBS)

Oracle E-Business Suite products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the January 2020 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Oracle E-Business Suite Release 12 Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document (January 2020), [My Oracle Support Note 2613782.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2613782.1).

#### Oracle Enterprise Manager Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 50 new security patches for Oracle Enterprise Manager.  10 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  None of these patches are applicable to client-only installations, i.e., installations that do not have Oracle Enterprise Manager installed. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpujan2020verbose.html#EM)

Oracle Enterprise Manager products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle Enterprise Manager products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle Enterprise Manager risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle Enterprise Manager products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the January 2020 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Enterprise Manager. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update January 2020 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2602410.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2602410.1).
