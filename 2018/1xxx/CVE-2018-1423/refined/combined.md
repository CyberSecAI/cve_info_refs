# Security Bulletin: Multiple vulnerabilities in IBM Jazz Team Server affect IBM Rational products based on IBM Jazz technology

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

Multiple vulnerabilities in the IBM Jazz Team Server affecting the following IBM Rational Products: Collaborative Lifecycle Management (CLM), Rational DOORS Next Generation (RDNG), Rational Engineering Lifecycle Manager (RELM), Rational Team Concert (RTC), Rational Quality Manager (RQM), Rational Rhapsody Design Manager (Rhapsody DM), and Rational Software Architect (RSA DM).

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2018-1492](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1492)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2018-1423](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1423)

**DESCRIPTION:** IBM Rhapsody DM could disclose sensitive information to an authenticated attacker that could be used in further attacks agains the system.

CVSS Base Score: 4.3

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/139026> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2017-12626](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-12626)

**DESCRIPTION:** Apache POI is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error while parsing malicious WMF, EMF, MSG and macros and specially crafted DOC, PPT and XLS. By persuading a victim to open a specially crafted file, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the application to enter into an infinite loop or an out of memory exception.
