- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in IBM Rational Engineering Lifecycle Manager (RELM)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is vulnerable to cross-site scripting, allowing users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code within the Web UI.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker could embed malicious JavaScript code, altering the intended functionality of the application. This could potentially lead to the disclosure of credentials within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user interacts with the compromised Web UI by clicking a link/button or visiting a page with the malicious code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious JavaScript code into the web UI. A low privileged user can potentially exploit this. The attacker also needs to trick a user to interact with the injected code.
