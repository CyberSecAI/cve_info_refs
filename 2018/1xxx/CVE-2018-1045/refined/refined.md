Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1045:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the event name field within the calendar block. This allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, specifically stored XSS.  Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the calendar event name field and subsequently executed in the browsers of other users viewing the calendar.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of other users' browsers.
*   **Potential Account Compromise:** An attacker could potentially steal user session cookies or perform actions on behalf of the victim.
*   **Website Defacement:** Arbitrary code execution could lead to defacement of the website interface or redirection to other malicious sites.
*  **Data theft:** Malicious scripts could be crafted to steal data from the victim's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Calendar Event Creation:** An attacker with the capability to create calendar events (e.g., teachers or other trusted users) can inject malicious JavaScript code within the event name field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the capability to create events in the calendar. This typically requires a trusted role, such as a teacher, within the Moodle system.
*   No specific network position seems required, the attack is performed through the web application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was found in Moodle versions 3.3 to 3.3.3, 3.2 to 3.2.6, 3.1 to 3.1.9, and earlier unsupported versions.
*   The fix was released in versions 3.3.4, 3.2.7, and 3.1.10.
*   The vulnerability is considered to have a "minor" severity/risk, likely because event creation is generally limited to trusted users.
*   The commit log links to the code changes that resolved the issue.
*   The tracker issue is MDL-60235, which provides further information about the context and scope of the vulnerability.
