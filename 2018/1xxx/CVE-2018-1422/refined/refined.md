Based on the provided document, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1422:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue present in IBM Rational DOORS Next Generation. The document doesn't specify the exact injection point or mechanism, but it's categorized as a potential XSS attack.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web application, which can then be executed in the browsers of other users. This could lead to various impacts, including:
- Session hijacking
- Stealing sensitive information
- Defacement of the web page
- Redirecting users to malicious sites

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a malicious script injection via the vulnerable Rational DOORS Next Generation application. The specific injection method is not detailed, but it would likely involve manipulating input fields or other areas where user-supplied data is reflected in the output without proper sanitization.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to be able to inject malicious script into the vulnerable component of the web application. This likely means that the attacker would need to be able to access a part of the application where they can input or manipulate data. No information about authentication is given so it is not possible to say if authentication is needed.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
- Rational Requirements Composer 5.0 - 5.0.2
- Rational DOORS Next Generation 6.0 - 6.0.5

**Fixes:**
