Dell EMC Identifier:  DSA-2018-084

CVE Identifier:  CVE-2018-1245, CVE-2018-1255

Severity Rating:  CVSS v3 Base Score: See below for CVSs v3 scores.

Severity:  Critical

Affected Products:
RSA Identity Governance and Lifecycle version 7.0.1, all patch levels (all deployments)
RSA Identity Governance and Lifecycle version 7.0.2, all patch levels (all deployments)
RSA Identity Governance and Lifecycle version 7.1.0, all patch levels (all deployments)

Unaffected Products:
RSA Via Lifecycle and Governance version 7.0, all patch levels (all deployments)
RSA Identity Management & Governance (RSA IMG) versions 6.9.1, all patch levels (all deployments)

Summary:
RSA Identity Governance and Lifecycle, RSA Via Lifecycle and Governance, and RSA IMG contain fixes for multiple
vulnerabilities that could potentially be exploited by malicious users to compromise the affected system.

Details:
Authorization ByPass Vulnerability (CVE-2018-1245)
RSA Identity Lifecycle and Governance versions 7.0.1, 7.0.2 and 7.1.0 contains an authorization bypass vulnerability
within the workflow architect component (ACM). A remote authenticated malicious user with non-admin privileges could
potentially bypass the Java Security Policies. Once bypassed, a malicious user could potentially run arbitrary system
commands at the OS level with application owner privileges on the affected system.  CVSS v3 Base Score: 9.0
AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

Reflected Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability (CVE-2018-1255)RSA Identity Lifecycle and Governance versions 7.0.1, 7.0.2
and 7.1.0 contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability. A remote unauthenticated attacker could potentially
exploit this vulnerability by tricking a victim application user to supply malicious HTML or JavaScript code to a
vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser.
CVSS v3 Base Score: 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

Recommendation:
The following RSA Identity Governance and Lifecycle, RSA Via Lifecycle and Governance, and RSA IMG releases contain
resolutions to these vulnerabilities:
RSA Identity Governance and Lifecycle 7.1.0:   7.1.0 P01 or later
RSA Identity Governance and Lifecycle 7.0.2:   7.0.2 P07 or later
RSA Identity Governance and Lifecycle 7.0.1:  Requires upgrading to 7.0.2 P07 or later

Customers can obtain the documentation and software for these releases by downloading them from the Downloads area on
