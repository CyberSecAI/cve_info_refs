- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `eauth` executable in IBM Spectrum LSF was vulnerable to privilege escalation due to the preloading of `getuid`. This allowed users to change their job user at job submission time.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Privilege escalation vulnerability due to improper handling of user IDs during job submission. Specifically, the ability to preload the `getuid` function.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can escalate their privileges by changing their job user at job submission time.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious user with the ability to submit jobs through the `eauth` executable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have the ability to submit jobs to the LSF system and be able to exploit the preloading of the `getuid` function.
