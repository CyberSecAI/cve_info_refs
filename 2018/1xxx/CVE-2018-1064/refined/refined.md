Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1064:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of CVE-2018-1064 is an incomplete fix for CVE-2018-5748 in libvirt. The original vulnerability (CVE-2018-5748) was a resource exhaustion issue in the QEMU monitor due to insufficient validation of incoming data. The fix for CVE-2018-5748 was incomplete, and the same vulnerability was exploitable through the QEMU guest agent, as identified in CVE-2018-1064. This was caused by libvirt not limiting the amount of data read from the QEMU monitor socket.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient input validation
- Lack of limits on data read from the QEMU monitor socket leading to resource exhaustion

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) - An attacker can cause a resource exhaustion on the virtualization host by sending excessive data via the QEMU guest agent, thereby rendering the system unavailable.
- Memory exhaustion on the virtualization host

**Attack Vectors:**
- A privileged user in the guest can send excessive data to the host via the QEMU guest agent

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a privileged account inside a virtual guest machine.
- The attacker needs the capability to communicate with the libvirt host through the QEMU guest agent.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was present in libvirt versions prior to the fixes provided by the security updates.
- The fix involved adding a size limit to `src/qemu/qemu_agent.c`.
- Red Hat assigned a "Low" security impact to this issue, while Debian considered it a medium-severity issue.
- The vulnerability affected multiple Linux distributions including Ubuntu, Debian, and Red Hat.
- The initial vulnerability (CVE-2018-5748) was discovered by Daniel P. Berrange and Peter Krempa (Red Hat), and the incomplete fix (CVE-2018-1064) was discovered by Daniel P. Berrange (Red Hat).
