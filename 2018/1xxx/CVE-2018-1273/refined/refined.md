Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-1273:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Improper neutralization of special elements within a property binder in Spring Data Commons. This allows an attacker to manipulate how data is bound to objects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Property Binding Vulnerability:** The core issue is that Spring Data Commons' property binder does not correctly handle special elements in request parameters. This allows for the injection of malicious expressions.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The vulnerability can lead to RCE through crafted request parameters or payload binding.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** This can lead to full control of the application and the underlying server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Parameters:**  Attackers can supply specially crafted request parameters against Spring Data REST-backed HTTP resources.
*   **Projection-Based Request Payload Binding:** Attackers can exploit how Spring Data's projection-based mechanism binds request payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application.
*   **Unauthenticated:**  The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated remote users. However, the use of authentication and authorization (e.g., via Spring Security) can limit exposure to authorized users.

**Affected Components:**

*   Spring Data Commons versions prior to 1.13.11
*   Spring Data REST versions prior to 2.6.11 and 3.0.6
*   Older unsupported versions of the mentioned products are also affected

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade to Spring Data Commons version 1.13.11 or later for 1.13.x users.
*   Upgrade to Spring Data Commons version 2.0.6 or later for 2.0.x users.
*   Upgrade to Spring Data REST 2.6.11 or later for 2.6.x users.
*   Upgrade to Spring Data REST 3.0.6 or later for 3.0.x users.
*   Older versions should be upgraded to a supported branch.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was identified and reported by Philippe Arteau, GoSecure Inc.
*   Spring Security, if implemented, can limit the exposure by restricting access to authorized users.
