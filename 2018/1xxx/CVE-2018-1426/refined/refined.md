- **Root cause of vulnerability**: IBM GSKit duplicates the PRNG (Pseudo-Random Number Generator) state across fork() system calls when multiple ICC (Integrated Cryptographic Coprocessor) instances are loaded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Duplication of the PRNG state, leading to duplicate Session IDs and a risk of duplicate key material.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Potential compromise of cryptographic keys due to the use of duplicate keys.
    - Generation of duplicate Session IDs, which can be exploited to impersonate legitimate users.
    - Exposure of highly sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack, as the issue involves session IDs and key material.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs network access to exploit this vulnerability, as the issue is related to cryptographic materials used in network communication. The attacker must be in a position to intercept/observe the vulnerable communications/sessions.
