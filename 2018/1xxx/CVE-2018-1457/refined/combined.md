# Security Bulletin: Rational DOORS is affected by multiple vulnerabilities

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

Rational DOORS has addressed the following vulnerabilities

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2018-1457](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1457)

## Affected Products and Versions

Rational DOORS: 9.5.1 - 9.5.1.9

Rational DOORS: 9.5.2 - 9.5.2.8

Rational DOORS: 9.6.0 - 9.6.0.7

Rational DOORS: 9.6.1 - 9.6.1.10
Rational DOORS: 9.7.x

The following Rational DOORS components are affected:

* Rational DOORS desktop client
* Rational DOORS interoperation server

## Remediation/Fixes

Upgrade to the fix pack that corresponds to the version of Rational DOORS that you are running, as shown in the following table. Upgrade the Rational DOORS client, the Rational DOORS database server, and the Rational DOORS interoperation server.

NOTE: You should verify applying this fix does not cause any compatibility issues.

| **Rational DOORS version** | **Upgrade to fix pack** |
| --- | --- |
| 9.5.1 - 9.5.1.9 | [9.5.1.10](http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/quickorder?product=ibm%2FRational%2FRational+DOORS&fixids=9.5.1.10-RATIONAL-DOORS-fixpack1&release=9.5&platform=All&source=SAR) |
| 9.5.2 - 9.5.2.8 | [9.5.2.9](http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/quickorder?product=ibm%2FRational%2FRational+DOORS&fixids=9.5.2.9-RATIONAL-DOORS-fixpack1&release=9.5&platform=All&source=SAR) |
| 9.6.0 - 9.6.0.7 | [9.6.0.8](http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/quickorder?product=ibm%2FRational%2FRational+DOORS&fixids=9.6.0.8-RATIONAL-DOORS-fixpack1&release=9.6.0.0&platform=All&source=SAR) |
| 9.6.1 - 9.6.1.10 | [9.6.1.11](http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/quickorder?product=ibm%2FRational%2FRational+DOORS&fixids=9.6.1.11-RATIONAL-DOORS-fixpack&release=9.6.1.10&platform=All&source=SAR) |

*For Rational DOORS version 9.5.0.x and earlier, IBM recommends upgrading to a fixed, supported version/release/platform of the product.*

**Citrix and Remote desktop**

To reduce installation overhead and to increase security, many clients make use of remote desktop software (Citrix or Microsoft Remote Desktop).  All remote desktop solutions provide communication level security in addition to the benefits for installation.  Clients using a remote desk top solution such as Citrix XenApp can organize their network infrastructure to forbid users accessing DOORS directly and so avoid issues regarding communication exposures as described by this vulnerability.

**Update to Server Security**

The fix to prevent an attacker to gain DOORS administrator privileges is an enhancement to the DOORS server security functionality. DOORS must be configured to use server security to enable this feature. When enabled, interop servers will now only connect to the database server if approved. This can be done by either starting the database server using the "secureInteropbyIP" command line switch or by adding the interop server certificate information to a allowlist.dat file. The allowlist.dat file needs to be located at the top level of the DOORS data directory.

If the database server is started using the "secureInteropbyIP" command line switch then the allowlist.dat file is unnecessary if all the interop servers are running on the same machine as the database server. Interop servers must be started with the "sssServer" command line switch to be recongised as secure by the database server.

For further information see the documentation on how to configure [server security](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYQBZ_9.6.1/com.ibm.doors.configuring.doc/topics/c_configuringrserversidesecurity.html).

**Configure Rational DOORS Web Access**

If you are using Rational DOORS Web Access, after you upgrade, but before you start the Rational DOORS Web Access server, edit the core configuration file and set the required version of the interoperation server to the version of the fix pack upgrade, as described in the following steps.

**Procedure:**

1. To edit the Rational DOORS Web Access core configuration file, open the festival.xml file, which is in the server\festival\config directory.
2. Add the following line in the <f:properties> section:

   <**f:property name="interop.version" value="9.n.n.n"** />

   Replace "9.n.n.n" with the version of the fix pack upgrade: 9.5.1.10, 9.5.2.9, 9.6.0.8, or 9.6.1.11.
3. Save and close the file.

After this revision, only the specified version of the interoperation server can access the Rational DOORS database.
