Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-1201:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause of CVE-2018-1201 is a persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the `description` parameter of the `/job/policies` endpoint in the Dell EMC Isilon OneFS web interface does not properly sanitize user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The web interface allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code into the `description` field of a job policy. This payload is then stored and executed whenever a user views the Impact Policies section of the Job Operations page. This is a persistent XSS vulnerability because the malicious script is stored and re-executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution in User's Browser:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript or HTML code within the browser of a user who is logged into the Isilon OneFS web console and views the Job Operations page.
*   **Potential Session Hijacking/Account Compromise:** This could lead to the attacker gaining access to the user's session or potentially their account by stealing cookies or credentials, performing actions on their behalf within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability exists within the web interface of Dell EMC Isilon OneFS, specifically the `/job/policies` endpoint.
*   **Malicious Input Injection:** An attacker injects the malicious script into the vulnerable `description` field when creating or modifying a job policy.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Administrator Access:** To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have administrative privileges to create or modify job policies within the Isilon OneFS system through the web interface.
*   **Knowledge of Target URL/Parameter:** The attacker needs to know which specific URL and parameter is vulnerable for injecting the XSS payload.
*   **User Interaction:** The malicious code is executed when a victim, who is a logged in user of the web interface, views the Job Operations page.

**Technical Details:**
*   The attacker sends a POST request to `/platform/1/job/policies` with a JSON payload that includes the malicious script in the `description` parameter.

```json
{
"name":"my policy",
"description":"<img src=x onerror=\"alert(1)\"/>",
"intervals":[
   {
      "begin":"Sunday 00:00",
      "end":"Sunday 00:00",
      "impact":"Low"
    },
    {
        "impact":"Low",
        "begin":"Sunday 01:03",
        "end":"Monday 01:01"
    }
 ]
}
```
*   The vulnerable code is when rendering the description field on the Job Operations page, the injected script is executed by the victim's browser.

This information provides more detail than the basic CVE description, which simply indicates that the job policy description is vulnerable to XSS. The provided information shows the specific location, the method of exploitation and the type of access required.
