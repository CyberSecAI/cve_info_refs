### Description

FULL PRODUCT VERSION :

java version "1.6.0\_20"

Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0\_20-b02)

Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 16.3-b01, mixed mode, sharing)

ADDITIONAL OS VERSION INFORMATION :

Ubuntu 7.04

Linux coconut 2.6.20-16-server #2 SMP Fri Aug 31 01:01:45 UTC 2007 i686 GNU/Linux

also reproduced on:

Windows 7 Professional 64-bit

Microsoft Windows [Version 6.1.7600]

A DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM :

Using the getLastModified() call on a URLConnection for jar:file: or file: URLs causes file handles to remain open. When performing many of these calls in quick succession, the operating system can easily hit the open file handles limit. E.g., on an Ubuntu Linux install, the system-wide open file limit is 1024 by default, out of which a large portion may already be consumed by other processes.

STEPS TO FOLLOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM :

Open a jar:file: URL connection. E.g. run getClass().getResource("META-INF/MANIFEST.MF").openConnection(). This returns a sun.net.[www.protocol.jar.JarURLConnection](http://www.protocol.jar.JarURLConnection).

On this URL connection, run getLastModified().

This runs, in sequence,

java.net.URLConnection.getHeaderFieldDate(),

sun.net.[www.protocol.jar.JarURLConnection.getHeaderField(),](http://www.protocol.jar.JarURLConnection.getHeaderField(),)

sun.net.[www.protocol.file.FileURLConnection.getHeaderField(),](http://www.protocol.file.FileURLConnection.getHeaderField(),)

sun.net.[www.protocol.file.FileURLConnection.initializeHeaders(),](http://www.protocol.file.FileURLConnection.initializeHeaders(),)

sun.net.[www.protocol.file.FileURLConnection.connect()](http://www.protocol.file.FileURLConnection.connect()).

This last call, opens a FileInputStream which is not closed, further on.

EXPECTED VERSUS ACTUAL BEHAVIOR :

EXPECTED -

The getLastModified() call does not cause a file handle to be opened, or closes it before returning.

ACTUAL -

A file handle remains open.

REPRODUCIBILITY :

This bug can be reproduced always.

---------- BEGIN SOURCE ----------

// NOTE: This code snippet should be run on a platform where the 'lsof' command is available (e.g. Linux).

// The problem is present on Windows, but it is not as easy to show the number of open files to expose the problem.

private void exposeFileHandleLeakOnJarUrlConnection() throws InterruptedException, IOException {

URL jarUrl = LastModifiedBugExposer.class.getResource("/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF");

printNumberOfOpenFiles("jar");

for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {

jarUrl.openConnection().getLastModified();

printNumberOfOpenFiles("jar");

}

}

private void printNumberOfOpenFiles(String method) throws InterruptedException, IOException {

Process process = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("lsof");

BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(process.getInputStream()));

int lines = 0;

while (reader.readLine() != null) {

++lines;

}

reader.close();

process.waitFor();

System.out.println("Number of open files (" + method + "): " + lines);

}

---------- END SOURCE ----------

CUSTOMER SUBMITTED WORKAROUND :

Use the following code to obtain the last modified date of a JAR file:

new File(((JarURLConnection)conn).getJarFile().getName()).lastModified()

### Description

Repeat web management console login and browser cache clear, every time open static resource of web console module following jar, don't close it until run gc.

```
wildfly-12.0.0.Final/modules/system/layers/base/org/jboss/as/console/main/release-stream-2.9.15.Final-resources.jar

```

It is likely cause call java.net.URLConnection.getLastModified() in io.undertow.server.handlers.resource.URLResource.getLastModified().

JarURLConnection.getLastModified() cause file handler leak.

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1573391#c0)  Sam Fowler    2018-05-01 04:06:46 UTC  ``` Google Guava versions 11.0 through 24.1 are vulnerable to unbounded memory allocation in the AtomicDoubleArray class (when serialized with Java serialization) and Compound Ordering class (when serialized with GWT serialization). An attacker could exploit applications that use Guava and deserialize untrusted data to cause a denial of service.
