{
  "CVE-2018-1114": {
    "description": "The `JarURLConnection.getLastModified()` method in Undertow causes a file descriptor leak, which could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service by repeatedly opening connections. This vulnerability is triggered when accessing static resources within a JAR file.",
    "affected_components": [
      "Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes",
       "rhvm-appliance",
      "Red Hat Fuse"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The `getLastModified()` method in `java.net.URLConnection` for jar:file or file: URLs does not close the underlying `FileInputStream`, leading to a file descriptor leak.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "File descriptor leak",
      "Denial of Service"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could exploit the file descriptor leak to cause a denial of service by exhausting file descriptors on the server.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Repeatedly opening connections to access static resources within a JAR file."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server, specifically to a URL which results in accessing a static resource from a JAR file."
