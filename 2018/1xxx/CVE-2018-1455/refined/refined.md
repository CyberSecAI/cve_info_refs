- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in IBM Tivoli Application Dependency Discovery Manager (TADDM).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application is vulnerable to CSRF. This means it does not adequately protect against malicious and unauthorized actions transmitted from a user that the website trusts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute malicious and unauthorized actions, leveraging a user's trusted session.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to trick a user into submitting a crafted request to the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need direct access to the TADDM application or server. They require a way to trick a logged-in user into triggering a malicious request.
