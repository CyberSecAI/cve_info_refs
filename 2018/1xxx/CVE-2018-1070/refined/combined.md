It's not run once on the gc.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1553012#c3)  Steve Milner    2018-03-08 14:52:57 UTC  ``` Which form of cri-o installed was used?   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1553012#c4)  Michael Gugino    2018-03-08 15:07:17 UTC  ``` This seems to be caused by hard-coding node-labels in kubelet args when using crio:  <https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/commit/55f6b3879d770d756963564a5894c09806a31003>  Are these strictly necessary?  I don't think they are, they don't look specific to crio and probably can be removed.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1553012#c5)  Steve Milner    2018-03-08 15:20:05 UTC  ``` Good catch Michael! To my knowledge the node-labels that are hard coded in the template shouldn't be required. I'll remove them and push the PR up.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1553012#c6)  Steve Milner    2018-03-08 15:24:45 UTC  ``` PR: <https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/pull/7453>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1553012#c7)  Scott Dodson    2018-03-08 20:29:25 UTC  ``` Release-3.9 backport <https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/pull/7462>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1553012#c9)  Gan Huang    2018-03-09 08:44:21 UTC  ``` Verified in openshift-ansible-3.9.4-1.git.0.a49cc04.el7.noarch.rpm   ``` |  |

## Topic

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release 3.9.31 is now available with updates to packages and images that address security issues, fix several bugs, and add enhancements.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is the company's cloud computing Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution designed for on-premise or private cloud deployments.

This advisory contains the RPM packages for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.9.31. See the following advisory for the container images for this release:

[https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2018:2014](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2018%3A2014)

Security Fix(es):

* routing: Malicious Service configuration can bring down routing for an entire shard (CVE-2018-1070)
* openshift-ansible: Incorrectly quoted values in etcd.conf causes disabling of SSL client certificate authentication (CVE-2018-1085)
* source-to-image: Builder images with assembler-user LABEL set to root allows attackers to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2018-10843)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank David Hocky (Comcast) for reporting CVE-2018-1085. The CVE-2018-1070 issue was discovered by Mark Chappell (Red Hat) and the CVE-2018-10843 issue was discovered by Jeremy Choi (Red Hat).

Space precludes documenting all of the bug fixes and enhancements in this advisory. See the following Release Notes documentation, which will be updated shortly for this release, for details about these changes:

<https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.9/release_notes/ocp_3_9_release_notes.html>

All OpenShift Container Platform 3.9 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages and images.
