{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The fix for CVE-2016-9606 was incomplete, and Yaml unmarshalling is still possible via `Yaml.load()` in YamlProvider of RESTEasy.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unsafe unmarshalling in YamlProvider allows code execution.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending malicious YAML content to an endpoint that uses the vulnerable YamlProvider.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted YAML payload to a server that has the vulnerable `YamlProvider` enabled."
