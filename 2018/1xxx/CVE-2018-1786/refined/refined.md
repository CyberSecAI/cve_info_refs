- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect accumulation of TCP/IP sockets in a CLOSE_WAIT state.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of TCP/IP sockets leads to resource leakage.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of service due to TCP/IP resource exhaustion.
- **Attack vectors**: Network based, through TCP/IP connections.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Remote attacker with ability to initiate TCP/IP connections to the vulnerable services.
