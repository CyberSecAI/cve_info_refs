    "CVE": "CVE-2018-1048",
    "description": "The undertow: ALLOW_ENCODED_SLASH option not taken into account in the AjpRequestParser vulnerability exists in the AJP connector of Undertow. This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass security constraints by encoding the slash (/) and backslash (\\) characters in a URL, potentially leading to path traversal and the disclosure of arbitrary local files.",
    "affected_components": [
      "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The AJP connector in Undertow does not properly use the ALLOW_ENCODED_SLASH option.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Path Traversal",
      "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could perform path traversal attacks, leading to the potential disclosure of arbitrary local files.",
    "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via an HTTP request using the AJP connector.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the server utilizing the AJP connector."
