{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an OS command injection in the mechanism that processes usernames for authentication.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "OS Command Injection",
      "Unauthenticated access"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the affected system, gaining complete control over the RecoverPoint device and its underlying Linux OS. The attacker can also pivot to other systems connected to the RecoverPoint device, such as Active Directory.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local tty console login",
         "Remote Network"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs either local access to the tty console or network visibility of the RecoverPoint device. No prior authentication or credentials are required."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is exploited by injecting a command into the username field at the local tty console login prompt. The provided proof of concept uses the command `$(bash > &2)` to spawn a root shell. This vulnerability is rated as critical severity (CVSS 9.8)."
