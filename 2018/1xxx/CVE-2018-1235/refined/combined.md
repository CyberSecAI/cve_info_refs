##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Foregenix is disclosing six vulnerabilities which were identified in Dell EMC RecoverPoint products during a recent engagement.

## Critical Dell EMC RecoverPoint Vulnerabilities Exposed by Foregenix

In the course of the engagement, Foregenix encountered several Dell EMC RecoverPoint devices as part of the designated scope. Foregenix was aware of some recently patched vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-1184, CVE-2018-1185) affecting RecoverPoint devices, for which no public exploits were available. As well as deducing a method of successfully exploiting these known vulnerabilities, Paul Taylor, one of our senior penetration testers, discovered five additional new zero-day vulnerabilities in the RecoverPoint devices, as well as an insecure configuration option which also constitutes a vulnerability.

The vulnerabilities, one of which is of critical severity, affected all versions of Dell EMC RecoverPoint prior to 5.1.2 and RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines prior to 5.1.1.3. The critical vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote code execution with root privileges. This means, that if an attacker with no knowledge of any credentials has visibility of RecoverPoint on the network, or local access to it, they can gain complete control over the RecoverPoint and its underlying Linux operating system.

To show the extent of compromise possible, during the engagement, once Foregenix had complete control of the RecoverPoint devices, it was then possible to exploit some of the other zero-day vulnerabilities discovered in order to pivot and gain control of the Microsoft Active Directory network that the RecoverPoints were integrated with.

Following Foregenix’s responsible disclosure in February 2018 to Dell EMC, the vendor has released security fixes on 2018-05-18 to address some of these vulnerabilities. The fixes can be obtained from Dell EMC support. Please contact Dell EMC technical support representative for any assistance or further information. For more details on Dell EMC Vulnerability Response Policy please refer to their product security response center.

Summary of identified vulnerabilities:

At the time of writing Dell EMC has issued CVEs for three of the vulnerabilities and included them in its advisory DSA-2018-095 scheduled for public release on 2018-05-21. Here is a summary of the vulnerabilities, with the full disclosure further down the page:

**Critical unauthenticated remote code execution with root privileges via unspecified attack vector** (CVE-2018-1235, CVSS 9.8, critical severity)

* Permits an attacker with visibility of a RecoverPoint device on the network to gain complete control over the underlying Linux operating system.

**Administrative menu arbitrary file read** (CVE-2018-1242, CVSS 6.7, medium severity)

* An attacker with access to the boxmgmt administrative menu can read files from the file system which are accessible to the boxmgmt user.

**LDAP credentials in Tomcat log file** (CVE-2018-1241, CVSS 6.2, medium severity)

* In certain conditions, RecoverPoint will leak plaintext credentials into a log file.

**World readable log contains password hash** (CVE not issued at time of writing)

* RecoverPoint is shipped with a system password hash stored in a world readable file.

**Hardcoded root password** (CVE not issued at time of writing)

* RecoverPoint uses a hardcoded root password which can only be changed by contacting the vendor.

**LDAP credentials sent in cleartext** (CVE not issued at time of writing)

* An insecure configuration option permits LDAP credentials sent by the RecoverPoint to be intercepted by attackers.

### Find full details of the vulnerabilities below:

**Vulnerability Title:** Critical unauthenticated remote code execution with root privileges via unspecified attack vector

**Vulnerability Reference:** CVE-2018-1235 (CVSS 9.8, critical severity)

**Vendor Advisory:** DSA-2018-095

**Vulnerable Product:** Dell EMC RecoverPoint, Dell EMC RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines

**Vulnerable Versions:** All versions prior to RP 5.1.2, and prior to RP4VMs 5.1.1.3

**Credit:** Paul Taylor (@bao7uo) / Foregenix Ltd.

**Vulnerability Details:** The critical vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote code execution with root privileges. This means, that if an attacker has visibility of RecoverPoint on the network, they can gain complete control over the underlying Linux operating system. The attack can also be performed locally. Due to the critical nature of this vulnerability and ease of exploitation, at this stage further details are not being released to provide opportunity for RecoverPoint customers to patch the vulnerability.

**Remediation:** Dell EMC advise that upgrading to the latest version will fix the vulnerability.

**Advisory Timeline:**

* 2018-02-09 - Discovery
* 2018-02-13 - Reported to Dell EMC
* 2018-05-18 - Upgrade release date
* 2018-05-21 - General public disclosure date

**Vulnerability Title:** Administrative menu arbitrary file read

**Vulnerability Reference:** CVE-2018-1242 (CVSS 6.7, medium severity)

**Vendor Advisory:** DSA-2018-095

**Vulnerable Product:** Dell EMC RecoverPoint, Dell EMC RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines

**Vulnerable Versions:** All versions prior to RP 5.1.2, and prior to RP4VMs 5.1.1.3

**Credit:** Paul Taylor (@bao7uo) / Foregenix Ltd.

**Vulnerability Details:** When logging in as boxmgmt and running an internal command, the ssh command may be used to display the contents of files from the file system which are accessible to the boxmgmt user. For example /etc/passwd can be read:

ssh -F /etc/passwd 127.0.0.1

**Remediation:** Dell EMC advise that upgrading to the latest version will fix the vulnerability.

**Advisory Timeline:**

* 2018-02-13 - Discovery
* 2018-02-15 - Reported to Dell EMC
* 2018-05-18 - Upgrade release date

**Vulnerability Details:** The file /distribution.log (and /home/kos/kbox/src/installation/distribution/kdist.pl) contains "root" password hashes for grub. File permissions allow this file to be read by any user. Dell EMC initially issued a CVE for this vulnerability, but then revoked it, claiming that the log file was only readable by root. Foregenix contested this, having been able to read the file as the www-data user, such as would be possible following a web application compromise. Despite revoking the CVE, the vendor appears to have fixed the issue for new installations of RecoverPoint, but at the time of writing it was not clear whether the vendor would reinstate the CVE, or whether performing an upgrade would remove the hash from previous versions of the world-readable log file.

**Remediation:** Foregenix would advise RecoverPoint customers to contact Dell EMC to request clarification about this vulnerability.

**Advisory Timeline:**

* 2018-02-13 - Discovery
* 2018-02-15 - Reported to Dell EMC
* 2018-05-21 - General public disclosure date

**Vulnerability Title:** Hardcoded root password

**Vulnerability Reference:** No CVE issued – PSRC-5485

**Vendor Advisory:** DSA-2018-095 – note about default system passwords

**Vulnerable Product:** Dell EMC RecoverPoint, Dell EMC RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines

**Vulnerable Versions:** All versions prior to RP 5.1.2, and prior to RP4VMs 5.1.1.3

**Credit:** Paul Taylor (@bao7uo) / Foregenix Ltd.

**Vulnerability Details:** The root account password for RecoverPoint's underlying linux operating system is a hardcoded password set by the vendor. An attacker with knowledge of the root password of one device can gain control over all of the devices by logging in at the local console, or gaining console access as an unprivileged user, and changing to root. Although a CVE was not issued, the vendor intends to update its documentation to make it clear that the password can only be changed by requesting a dedicated script from its support team. If an attacker with knowledge of the hardcoded password compromised a different user account on the RecoverPoint, they could use the password to escalate to root.

**Remediation:** Foregenix would advise all RecoverPoint customers to request this script and change the password.

**Advisory Timeline:**

* 2018-02-13 - Discovery
* 2018-02-15 - Reported to Dell EMC
* 2018-05-21 - General public disclosure date

**Vulnerability Title:** Insecure configuration option results in LDAP credentials sent as cleartext

**Vulnerability Reference:** No CVE issued - PSRC-5488

**Vulnerable Product:** Dell EMC RecoverPoint, Dell EMC RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines

**Vulnerable Versions:** All versions prior to RP 5.1.2, and prior to RP4VMs 5.1.1.3

**Credit:** Paul Taylor (@bao7uo) / Foregenix Ltd.

**Vulnerability Details:** When the LDAP simple bind configuration is used, credentials are sent from the RecoverPoint server in cleartext. This means that a man-in-the-middle attacker or an attacker who has gained access to the RecoverPoint using another vulnerability, can monitor the traffic and discover LDAP credentials which have been entrusted to the RecoverPoint. Dell EMC informed Foregenix that the RecoverPoint documentation provides a warning about the insecure nature of this configuration. There did not appear to be any warning in the RecoverPoint menu itself. Foregenix was able to successfully exploit this vulnerability, intercepting credentials sent from the RecoverPoint to compromise a Microsoft Active Directory domain.

**Remediation:** Foregenix would advise all RecoverPoint customers to ensure that if LDAP integration is required, it is configured to bind securely.

**Advisory Timeline:**

* 2018-02-13 - Discovery
* 2018-02-15 - Reported to Dell EMC
* 2018-05-21 - General public disclosure date
