Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-1247:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is an XML External Entity (XXE) injection vulnerability in the RSA Authentication Manager's Security Console.
- The application's XML parser resolves external entities, which allows an attacker to include malicious DTDs (Document Type Definitions) within XML files submitted to the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The primary vulnerability is that the application processes XML files with external entities enabled, without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to control the XML parsing process through a malicious DTD.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read arbitrary files from the RSA Authentication Manager's operating system with the permissions of the service user.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could cause a denial of service by injecting XML code that exhausts resources (e.g., "billion laughs attack").
- **Internal Network Reconnaissance:** An attacker can initiate arbitrary TCP connections to systems within the internal network, potentially enabling port scanning.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited by submitting a specially crafted XML file to the RSA Authentication Manager Security Console's import functionality. Specifically, the Security Console allows authenticated users to import SecurID Token jobs in XML format.
- The attacker needs to either be authenticated or trick an authenticated user into importing the malicious XML file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be either an authenticated user of the RSA Authentication Manager or must be able to trick an authenticated user into importing a malicious XML file.
- The attacker needs to host a malicious DTD file on a webserver that the RSA Authentication Manager server can access. This requires the RSA server to have network access to the attacker-controlled server.
- Network access from the RSA server to the attacker's server on TCP ports 80 and 8080 is assumed.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Mantas Juskauskas from SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab.
- The issue is fixed in RSA Authentication Manager version 8.3 P1 and later.
- The provided exploit-db content includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) of how the vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious XML file and a corresponding DTD file.
- The vulnerability was assigned a CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H).
- RSA security advisory DSA-2018-086 addresses this vulnerability.
