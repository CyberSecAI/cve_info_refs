- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to an incorrect permission assignment for a security-critical resource, allowing unintended actors to read or modify it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect permission assignment for a security-critical resource.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized reading or modification of a critical resource. This has a low impact on confidentiality and integrity and no impact on availability
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks with low privileges and no user interaction.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have low privileges on the system to exploit the vulnerability.
