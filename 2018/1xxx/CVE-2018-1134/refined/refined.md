- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Students who submitted assignments and exported them to portfolios could download any stored Moodle file by manipulating the download URL.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure direct object reference, improper access control. The portfolio assignment caller class did not properly restrict access to files, allowing users to download files they were not authorized to access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized access to any file stored in the Moodle instance. This could include sensitive student data, course materials, or other confidential information.
- **Attack vectors:** By modifying the download URL of a file exported to a portfolio.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be a student who submitted an assignment and exported it to a portfolio. They also need a basic understanding of how URLs work to manipulate the download link.
