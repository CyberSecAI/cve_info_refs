The content also shows various instances of this CVE being addressed in multiple Red Hat products, including JBoss Enterprise Application Platform, JBoss Web Server, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and Red Hat Fuse. The bug causes an infinite loop due to improper handling of an overflow, ultimately leading to a DoS.",

      "root_cause": "The root cause is an improper handling of overflow in the UTF-8 decoder within Apache Tomcat.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of overflow in UTF-8 decoding."
      ],
      "impact": "The vulnerability allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (DoS). This is achieved by triggering an infinite loop in the UTF-8 decoder leading to resource exhaustion and ultimately service disruption.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is remote. Attackers can send a specially crafted request with a malformed UTF-8 string to trigger the vulnerability.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker does not require any authentication, therefore, remote unauthenticated access to the service is sufficient to launch an attack."
