- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the exposure of the AccessToken Model over a REST API in IBM LoopBack. This allows an attacker to create an AccessToken for any user if they know the target user's ID.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Authentication bypass vulnerability due to improper access control over AccessToken Model creation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can gain access to other users' data and privileges, potentially including administrative rights.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through network access (REST API) by sending requests to create AccessTokens using known UserIDs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to know the UserID of the target user and have the ability to make requests to the REST API exposed by LoopBack.
