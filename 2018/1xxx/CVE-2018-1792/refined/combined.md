**Additional Instructions**

After you have applied the version specific fix, run the following platform specific commands as root on each affected system. Ensure that the $MQ\_INSTALLATION\_PATH variable is set to the root installation directory of your MQ installation, for example /opt/mqm, before running the commands. You may use the setmqenv command from the installation to achieve this if desired. If you are patching multiple installations, run the commands against each installation in turn.

Linux

chmod 0700 $MQ\_INSTALLATION\_PATH/maintenance

chown root:root $MQ\_INSTALLATION\_PATH/maintenance

chown root:root $MQ\_INSTALLATION\_PATH/fix-backups\*

chmod 0700 $MQ\_INSTALLATION\_PATH/fix-backups\*

Solaris

/usr/bin/find /var/sadm/pkg/mqm\* -name save -type d -exec /usr/bin/chmod 700 {} \;

/usr/bin/find /var/sadm/pkg/mqm\* -name save -type d -exec /usr/bin/chown root:root {} \;

chown root:root $MQ\_INSTALLATION\_PATH/fix-backups\*

chmod 0700 $MQ\_INSTALLATION\_PATH/fix-backups\*

HP-UX
