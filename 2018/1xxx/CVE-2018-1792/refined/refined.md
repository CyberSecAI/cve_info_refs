- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A problem within IBM MQ queue manager libraries could allow an attacker to escalate privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows a user with `mqm` login access to escalate privileges to root. The vulnerability seems to involve the `maintenance` directory and `fix-backups` files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain root user access on the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have `mqm` login access to the server.
