Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1202:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the "name" parameter within the NDMP (Network Data Management Protocol) user configuration page of the Dell EMC Isilon OneFS web administration interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is a persistent XSS vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input when setting the NDMP user name, allowing an attacker to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- When a user accesses the NDMP Settings section of the NDMP page, the injected malicious code will be executed within the user's browser session, in the context of the OneFS website.
-  This could lead to various attacks, including:
  - Stealing cookies or session tokens.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge.
  - Defacing the web interface.
  - Potentially gaining further access to the system, if combined with other exploits.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is triggered through the OneFS web administration interface.
- **Malicious Input:** A malicious administrator injects the payload in the `name` parameter when creating or modifying an NDMP user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrative Access:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges in order to access the NDMP user configuration page and manipulate the `name` parameter.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoints:**  The attacker needs to target the specific endpoint `/platform/3/protocols/ndmp/users`

**Technical Details:**
- The provided exploit shows a POST request to `/platform/3/protocols/ndmp/users` with a JSON payload where the "name" parameter is set to `"<img src=x onerror=\"alert(1)\"/>"`. This payload will be executed when an administrator visits the NDMP Settings page.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is considered "persistent" XSS, meaning the malicious code is stored on the server and executed every time a user views the affected page.
- The provided CVSS v3 score of 5.9 indicates a medium severity issue.
