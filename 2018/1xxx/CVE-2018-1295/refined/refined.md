  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2018-1295",
      "description": "Apache Ignite serialization mechanism does not have a list of classes allowed for serialization/deserialization, which makes it possible to run arbitrary code when 3-rd party vulnerable classes are present in Ignite classpath. The vulnerability can be exploited if the one sends a specially prepared form of a serialized object to one of the deserialization endpoints of some Ignite components - discovery SPI, Ignite persistence, Memcached endpoint, socket steamer.",
      "affected_products": [
        "Red Hat Fuse Integration Services 2.0 based on Fuse 6.3 R7"
      ],
      "root_cause": "The Apache Ignite serialization mechanism lacks a whitelist of allowed classes for serialization/deserialization.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Arbitrary code execution via deserialization"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by sending a specially crafted serialized object to one of the vulnerable deserialization endpoints if 3rd party vulnerable classes exist in the classpath.",
      "attack_vector": "The attack vector involves sending a malicious serialized object to a deserialization endpoint within Apache Ignite.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a specially prepared form of serialized object to one of the deserialization endpoints of some Ignite components, such as discovery SPI, Ignite persistence, Memcached endpoint, or socket streamer. It seems like no authentication is required."
