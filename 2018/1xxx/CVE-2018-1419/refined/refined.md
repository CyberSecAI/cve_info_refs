- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A deadlock can occur in the IBM MQ PAM code when the product is configured to use a PAM module for authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the IBM MQ PAM module, where a deadlock can be triggered.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation results in a denial of service, as further authentication attempts fail.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is triggered through the authentication process when a PAM module is in use.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to attempt authentication against an IBM MQ instance configured to use a vulnerable PAM module.
