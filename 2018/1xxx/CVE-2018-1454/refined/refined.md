- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by the failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) in IBM InfoSphere Information Governance Catalog and IBM InfoSphere Data Click.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of HSTS implementation. This allows for man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can potentially obtain sensitive information by intercepting communications between the client and the server.
- **Attack vectors:** Man-in-the-middle attacks. An attacker intercepts communications between the client and server, potentially gaining access to sensitive information.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the client and the affected IBM InfoSphere server.
