## Details

It was discovered that, when attempting to handle an out-of-memory

situation, a null pointer dereference could be triggered in the Linux

kernel in some circumstances. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-1000200](/security/CVE-2018-1000200))

Wen Xu discovered that the XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate meta-data information. An attacker could

use this to construct a malicious xfs image that, when mounted, could cause

a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-10323](/security/CVE-2018-10323))

Wen Xu discovered that the XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate xattr information. An attacker could use

this to construct a malicious xfs image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10840](/security/CVE-2018-10840))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly keep meta-data information consistent in some

situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image

that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-10881](/security/CVE-2018-10881))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle corrupted meta data in some situations. An

attacker could use this to specially craft an ext4 filesystem that caused a

denial of service (system crash) when mounted. ([CVE-2018-1093](/security/CVE-2018-1093))

Jann Horn discovered that the Linux kernel's implementation of random seed

data reported that it was in a ready state before it had gathered

sufficient entropy. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information. ([CVE-2018-1108](/security/CVE-2018-1108))

It was discovered that the procfs filesystem did not properly handle

processes mapping some memory elements onto files. A local attacker could

use this to block utilities that examine the procfs filesystem to report

operating system state, such as ps(1). ([CVE-2018-1120](/security/CVE-2018-1120))

Jann Horn discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly keep xattr information consistent in some

situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image

that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-11412](/security/CVE-2018-11412))

Piotr Gabriel Kosinski and Daniel Shapira discovered a stack-based buffer

overflow in the CDROM driver implementation of the Linux kernel. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-11506](/security/CVE-2018-11506))

Shankara Pailoor discovered that a race condition existed in the socket

handling code in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause

a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-12232](/security/CVE-2018-12232))

Shankara Pailoor discovered that the JFS filesystem implementation in the

Linux kernel contained a buffer overflow when handling extended attributes.

A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-12233](/security/CVE-2018-12233))

Felix Wilhelm discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel

did not properly perform permission checks in some situations when nested

virtualization is used. An attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this

to escape into an outer VM or the host OS. ([CVE-2018-12904](/security/CVE-2018-12904))

Wen Xu discovered that the XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle an error condition with a corrupted xfs

image. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious xfs image that,

when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-13094](/security/CVE-2018-13094))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly handle setgid file

creation when performed by a non-member of the group. A local attacker

could use this to gain elevated privileges. ([CVE-2018-13405](/security/CVE-2018-13405))

Silvio Cesare discovered that the generic VESA frame buffer driver in the

Linux kernel contained an integer overflow. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-13406](/security/CVE-2018-13406))

Jakub Jirasek discovered that multiple use-after-free errors existed in the

USB/IP implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-5814](/security/CVE-2018-5814))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ARM Advanced

Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA) driver in the Linux kernel that

could result in a double free. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-9415](/security/CVE-2018-9415))

It was discovered that an information leak existed in the generic SCSI

driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-1000204](/security/CVE-2018-1000204))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

##### Ubuntu 16.04

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

Debian Bug     : 922204

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

This update is unfortunately not available for the armel architecture.

CVE-2018-1108

    It was discovered that the random driver could generate random
    bytes through /dev/random and the getrandom() system call before
    gathering enough entropy that these would be unpredictable.  This
    could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of encrypted
    communications.

    The original fix for this issue had to be reverted because it
    caused the boot process to hang on many systems.  In this version,
    the random driver has been updated, making it more effective in
    gathering entropy without needing a hardware RNG.

CVE-2021-4149

    Hao Sun reported a flaw in the Btrfs fileysstem driver. There
    is a potential lock imbalance in an error path.  A local user
    might be able to exploit this for denial of service.

CVE-2021-39713

    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the network scheduling
    subsystem which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local user
    could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or
    crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-0494

    The scsi_ioctl() was susceptible to an information leak only
    exploitable by users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_SYS_RAWIO
    capabilities.

CVE-2022-0812

    It was discovered that the RDMA transport for NFS (xprtrdma)
    miscalculated the size of message headers, which could lead to a
    leak of sensitive information between NFS servers and clients.

CVE-2022-0854

    Ali Haider discovered a potential information leak in the DMA
    subsystem. On systems where the swiotlb feature is needed, this
    might allow a local user to read sensitive information.

CVE-2022-1011

    Jann Horn discovered a flaw in the FUSE (Filesystem in User-Space)
    implementation. A local user permitted to mount FUSE filesystems
    could exploit this to cause a use-after-free and read sensitive
    information.

CVE-2022-1012, CVE-2022-32296

    Moshe Kol, Amit Klein, and Yossi Gilad discovered a weakness
    in randomisation of TCP source port selection.

CVE-2022-1016

    David Bouman discovered a flaw in the netfilter subsystem where
    the nft_do_chain function did not initialize register data that
    nf_tables expressions can read from and write to. A local attacker
    can take advantage of this to read sensitive information.

CVE-2022-1198

    Duoming Zhou discovered a race condition in the 6pack hamradio
    driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could
    exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or
    crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-1199

    Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the AX.25 hamradio
    protocol, which could lead to a use-after-free or null pointer
    dereference. A local user could exploit this to cause a denial of
    service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2022-1353

    The TCS Robot tool found an information leak in the PF_KEY
    subsystem. A local user can receive a netlink message when an
    IPsec daemon registers with the kernel, and this could include
    sensitive information.

CVE-2022-1516

    A NULL pointer dereference flaw in the implementation of the X.25
    set of standardized network protocols, which can result in denial
    of service.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2022-1729

    Norbert Slusarek discovered a race condition in the perf subsystem
    which could result in local privilege escalation to root. The
    default settings in Debian prevent exploitation unless more
    permissive settings have been applied in the
    kernel.perf_event_paranoid sysctl.

CVE-2022-1734

    Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the nfcmrvl NFC driver
    that could lead to a use-after-free, double-free or null pointer
    dereference. A local user might be able to exploit these for
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2022-1974, CVE-2022-1975

    Duoming Zhou discovered that the NFC netlink interface was
    suspectible to denial of service.

CVE-2022-2153

    "kangel" reported a flaw in the KVM implementation for x86
    processors which could lead to a null pointer dereference. A local
    user permitted to access /dev/kvm could exploit this to cause a
    denial of service (crash).

CVE-2022-21123, CVE-2022-21125, CVE-2022-21166

    Various researchers discovered flaws in Intel x86 processors,
    collectively referred to as MMIO Stale Data vulnerabilities.
    These are similar to the previously published Microarchitectural
    Data Sampling (MDS) issues and could be exploited by local users
    to leak sensitive information.

    For some CPUs, the mitigations for these issues require updated
    microcode.  An updated intel-microcode package may be provided at
    a later date.  The updated CPU microcode may also be available as
    part of a system firmware ("BIOS") update.

    Further information on the mitigation can be found at
    <<https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/hw-vuln/processor_mmio_stale_data.html>>
    or in the linux-doc-4.9 package.

CVE-2022-23036, CVE-2022-23037, CVE-2022-23038, CVE-2022-23039,
CVE-2022-23040, CVE-2022-23041, CVE-2022-23042 (XSA-396)

    Demi Marie Obenour and Simon Gaiser of Invisible Things Lab
    discovered flaws in several Xen PV device frontends. These drivers
    misused the Xen grant table API in a way that could be exploited
    by a malicious device backend to cause data corruption, leaks of
    sensitive information, or a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2022-23960

    Researchers at VUSec discovered that the Branch History Buffer in
    Arm processors can be exploited to create information side-
    channels with speculative execution.  This issue is similar to
    Spectre variant 2, but requires additional mitigations on some
    processors.

    This can be exploited to obtain sensitive information from a
    different security context, such as from user-space to the kernel,
    or from a KVM guest to the kernel.

CVE-2022-24958

    A flaw was discovered that the USB gadget subsystem that could
    lead to a use-after-free. A local user permitted to configure USB
    gadgets could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-26490

    Buffer overflows in the STMicroelectronics ST21NFCA core driver
    can result in denial of service or privilege escalation.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2022-26966

    A flaw was discovered in the sr9700 USB networking driver. A local
    user able to attach a specially designed USB device could use this
    to leak sensitive information.

CVE-2022-27223

    A flaw was discovered in the udc-xilinx USB gadget-mode controller
    driver. On systems using this driver, a malicious USB host could
    exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or possibly to execute arbitrary code.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2022-28356

    "Beraphin" discovered that the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2 driver did
    not properly perform reference counting on some error paths. A
    local attacker can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial
    of service.

CVE-2022-28390

    A double free vulnerability was discovered in the EMS CPC-USB/ARM7
    CAN/USB interface driver.

CVE-2022-30594

    Jann Horn discovered a flaw in the interaction between ptrace and
    seccomp subsystems. A process sandboxed using seccomp() but still
    permitted to use ptrace() could exploit this to remove the seccomp
    restrictions.

CVE-2022-32250

    Aaron Adams discovered a use-after-free in Netfilter which may
    result in local privilege escalation to root.

CVE-2022-33981

    Yuan Ming from Tsinghua University reported a a race condition in
    the floppy driver involving use of the FDRAWCMD ioctl, which could
    lead to a use-after-free. A local user with access to a floppy
    drive device could exploit this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.
    This ioctl is now disabled by default.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.320-2.

For the armhf architecture, this update enables optimised
implementations of several cryptographic and CRC algorithms.  For at
least AES, this should remove a timing side-channel that could lead to
a leak of sensitive information.

This update includes many more bug fixes from stable updates
4.9.304-4.9.320 inclusive.  The random driver has been backported from
Linux 5.19, fixing numerous performance and correctness issues.  Some
changes will be visible:

- The entropy pool size is now 256 bits instead of 4096.  You may need
  to adjust the configuration of system monitoring or user-space
  entropy gathering services to allow for this.

- On systems without a hardware RNG, the kernel will log many more
  uses of /dev/urandom before it is fully initialised.  These uses
  were previously under-counted and this is not a regression.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux-azure](/security/cves?package=linux-azure) - Linux kernel for Microsoft Azure Cloud systems
* [linux-gcp](/security/cves?package=linux-gcp) - Linux kernel for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) systems
* [linux-hwe](/security/cves?package=linux-hwe) - Linux hardware enablement (HWE) kernel

## Details

USN-3695-2 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux Hardware Enablement

Kernel (HWE) kernel for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. Unfortunately, the fix

for [CVE-2018-1108](/security/CVE-2018-1108) introduced a regression where insufficient early

entropy prevented services from starting, leading in some situations

to a failure to boot, This update addresses the issue.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

Jann Horn discovered that the Linux kernel's implementation of random

seed data reported that it was in a ready state before it had gathered

sufficient entropy. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information. ([CVE-2018-1108](/security/CVE-2018-1108))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly initialize the crc32c checksum driver. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-1094](/security/CVE-2018-1094))

It was discovered that the cdrom driver in the Linux kernel contained an

incorrect bounds check. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-10940](/security/CVE-2018-10940))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate xattr sizes. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-1095](/security/CVE-2018-1095))

Jann Horn discovered that the 32 bit adjtimex() syscall implementation for

64 bit Linux kernels did not properly initialize memory returned to user

space in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-11508](/security/CVE-2018-11508))

It was discovered that an information leak vulnerability existed in the

floppy driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

expose sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-7755](/security/CVE-2018-7755))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-1014-gcp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-gcp)
  -
  [4.15.0-1014.14~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-gcp/4.15.0-1014.14~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-29-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-29.31~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.15.0-29.31~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-29-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-29.31~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.15.0-29.31~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-29-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-29.31~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.15.0-29.31~16.04.1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Details

It was discovered that, when attempting to handle an out-of-memory

situation, a null pointer dereference could be triggered in the Linux

kernel in some circumstances. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-1000200](/security/CVE-2018-1000200))

Wen Xu discovered that the XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate meta-data information. An attacker could

use this to construct a malicious xfs image that, when mounted, could cause

a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-10323](/security/CVE-2018-10323))

Wen Xu discovered that the XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate xattr information. An attacker could use

this to construct a malicious xfs image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10840](/security/CVE-2018-10840))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly keep meta-data information consistent in some

situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image

that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-10881](/security/CVE-2018-10881))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle corrupted meta data in some situations. An

attacker could use this to specially craft an ext4 filesystem that caused a

denial of service (system crash) when mounted. ([CVE-2018-1093](/security/CVE-2018-1093))

Jann Horn discovered that the Linux kernel's implementation of random seed

data reported that it was in a ready state before it had gathered

sufficient entropy. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information. ([CVE-2018-1108](/security/CVE-2018-1108))

It was discovered that the procfs filesystem did not properly handle

processes mapping some memory elements onto files. A local attacker could

use this to block utilities that examine the procfs filesystem to report

operating system state, such as ps(1). ([CVE-2018-1120](/security/CVE-2018-1120))

Jann Horn discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly keep xattr information consistent in some

situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image

that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-11412](/security/CVE-2018-11412))

Piotr Gabriel Kosinski and Daniel Shapira discovered a stack-based buffer

overflow in the CDROM driver implementation of the Linux kernel. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-11506](/security/CVE-2018-11506))

Shankara Pailoor discovered that a race condition existed in the socket

handling code in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause

a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-12232](/security/CVE-2018-12232))

Shankara Pailoor discovered that the JFS filesystem implementation in the

Linux kernel contained a buffer overflow when handling extended attributes.

A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-12233](/security/CVE-2018-12233))

Felix Wilhelm discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel

did not properly perform permission checks in some situations when nested

virtualization is used. An attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this

to escape into an outer VM or the host OS. ([CVE-2018-12904](/security/CVE-2018-12904))

Wen Xu discovered that the XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle an error condition with a corrupted xfs

image. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious xfs image that,

when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-13094](/security/CVE-2018-13094))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly handle setgid file

creation when performed by a non-member of the group. A local attacker

could use this to gain elevated privileges. ([CVE-2018-13405](/security/CVE-2018-13405))

Silvio Cesare discovered that the generic VESA frame buffer driver in the

Linux kernel contained an integer overflow. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-13406](/security/CVE-2018-13406))

Jakub Jirasek discovered that multiple use-after-free errors existed in the

USB/IP implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-5814](/security/CVE-2018-5814))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ARM Advanced

Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA) driver in the Linux kernel that

could result in a double free. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-9415](/security/CVE-2018-9415))

It was discovered that an information leak existed in the generic SCSI

driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-1000204](/security/CVE-2018-1000204))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-1020-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws)

* [linux-image-4.15.0-33-snapdragon](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.15.0-33.36](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.15.0-33.36)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1567306#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2018-04-13 18:58:40 UTC  ``` A weakness was found in the kernels implementation of random seed generation.  The random number seeding policy had three states.   0: The CRNG is not initialized at all 1: The CRNG has a small amount of entropy, hopefully good enough for    early-boot, non-cryptographical use cases 2: The CRNG is fully initialized and we are sure it is safe for    cryptographic use cases.  The crng_ready() function should only return true once we are in the last state.  Some users of the CRNG would access the random seed data before it was seeded to an acceptable value.  Knowing this value would weaken cryptographic methods if the seed was able to be determined.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2017-5715

    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various
    processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker
    controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary
    addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes
    running on the system.

    This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 2 (branch
    target injection) and is mitigated for the x86 architecture (amd64
    and i386) by using the "retpoline" compiler feature which allows
    indirect branches to be isolated from speculative execution.

CVE-2017-5753

    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various
    processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker
    controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary
    addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes
    running on the system.

    This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 1
    (bounds-check bypass) and is mitigated by identifying vulnerable
    code sections (array bounds checking followed by array access) and
    replacing the array access with the speculation-safe
    array_index_nospec() function.

    More use sites will be added over time.

CVE-2017-17975

    Tuba Yavuz reported a use-after-free flaw in the USBTV007
    audio-video grabber driver. A local user could use this for denial
    of service by triggering failure of audio registration.

CVE-2017-18193

    Yunlei He reported that the f2fs implementation does not properly
    handle extent trees, allowing a local user to cause a denial of
    service via an application with multiple threads.

CVE-2017-18216

    Alex Chen reported that the OCFS2 filesystem failed to hold a
    necessary lock during nodemanager sysfs file operations,
    potentially leading to a null pointer dereference.  A local user
    could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-18218

    Jun He reported a user-after-free flaw in the Hisilicon HNS ethernet
    driver. A local user could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-18222

    It was reported that the Hisilicon Network Subsystem (HNS) driver
    implementation does not properly handle ethtool private flags. A
    local user could use this for denial of service or possibly have
    other impact.

CVE-2017-18224

    Alex Chen reported that the OCFS2 filesystem omits the use of a
    semaphore and consequently has a race condition for access to the
    extent tree during read operations in DIRECT mode. A local user
    could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-18241

    Yunlei He reported that the f2fs implementation does not properly
    initialise its state if the "noflush_merge" mount option is used.
    A local user with access to a filesystem mounted with this option
    could use this to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2017-18257

    It was reported that the f2fs implementation is prone to an infinite
    loop caused by an integer overflow in the __get_data_block()
    function. A local user can use this for denial of service via
    crafted use of the open and fallocate system calls with an
    FS_IOC_FIEMAP ioctl.

CVE-2018-1065

    The syzkaller tool found a NULL pointer dereference flaw in the
    netfilter subsystem when handling certain malformed iptables
    rulesets. A local user with the CAP_NET_RAW or CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability (in any user namespace) could use this to cause a denial
    of service. Debian disables unprivileged user namespaces by default.

CVE-2018-1066

    Dan Aloni reported to Red Hat that the CIFS client implementation
    would dereference a null pointer if the server sent an invalid
    response during NTLMSSP setup negotiation.  This could be used
    by a malicious server for denial of service.

CVE-2018-1068

    The syzkaller tool found that the 32-bit compatibility layer of
    ebtables did not sufficiently validate offset values. On a 64-bit
    kernel, a local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (in any user
    namespace) could use this to overwrite kernel memory, possibly
    leading to privilege escalation. Debian disables unprivileged user
    namespaces by default.

CVE-2018-1092

    Wen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image would
    trigger a null dereference when mounted.  A local user able
    to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this for denial of
    service.

CVE-2018-1093

    Wen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image could trigger
    an out-of-bounds read in the ext4_valid_block_bitmap() function. A
    local user able to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this for
    denial of service.

CVE-2018-1108

    Jann Horn reported that crng_ready() does not properly handle the
    crng_init variable states and the RNG could be treated as
    cryptographically safe too early after system boot.

CVE-2018-5803

    Alexey Kodanev reported that the SCTP protocol did not range-check
    the length of chunks to be created.  A local or remote user could
    use this to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2018-7480

    Hou Tao discovered a double-free flaw in the blkcg_init_queue()
    function in block/blk-cgroup.c. A local user could use this to cause
    a denial of service or have other impact.

CVE-2018-7566

    Fan LongFei reported a race condition in the ALSA (sound)
    sequencer core, between write and ioctl operations.  This could
    lead to an out-of-bounds access or use-after-free.  A local user
    with access to a sequencer device could use this for denial of
    service or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-7740

    Nic Losby reported that the hugetlbfs filesystem's mmap operation
    did not properly range-check the file offset.  A local user with
    access to files on a hugetlbfs filesystem could use this to cause
    a denial of service.

CVE-2018-7757

    Jason Yan reported a memory leak in the SAS (Serial-Attached
    SCSI) subsystem.  A local user on a system with SAS devices
    could use this to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2018-7995

    Seunghun Han reported a race condition in the x86 MCE
    (Machine Check Exception) driver.  This is unlikely to have
    any security impact.

CVE-2018-8087

    A memory leak flaw was found in the hwsim_new_radio_nl() function in
    the simulated radio testing tool driver for mac80211, allowing a
    local user to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2018-8781

    Eyal Itkin reported that the udl (DisplayLink) driver's mmap
    operation did not properly range-check the file offset.  A local
    user with access to a udl framebuffer device could exploit this to
    overwrite kernel memory, leading to privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-8822

    Dr Silvio Cesare of InfoSect reported that the ncpfs client
    implementation did not validate reply lengths from the server.  An
    ncpfs server could use this to cause a denial of service or
    remote code execution in the client.

CVE-2018-10323

    Wen Xu reported a NULL pointer dereference flaw in the
    xfs_bmapi_write() function triggered when mounting and operating a
    crafted xfs filesystem image. A local user able to mount arbitrary
    filesystems could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2018-1000199

    Andy Lutomirski discovered that the ptrace subsystem did not
    sufficiently validate hardware breakpoint settings.  Local users
    can use this to cause a denial of service, or possibly for
    privilege escalation, on x86 (amd64 and i386) and possibly other
    architectures.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.88-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux-hwe](/security/cves?package=linux-hwe) - Linux hardware enablement (HWE) kernel

## Details

USN-3752-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 18.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 18.04 LTS for Ubuntu

16.04 LTS.

It was discovered that, when attempting to handle an out-of-memory

situation, a null pointer dereference could be triggered in the Linux

kernel in some circumstances. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-1000200](/security/CVE-2018-1000200))

Wen Xu discovered that the XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate meta-data information. An attacker could

use this to construct a malicious xfs image that, when mounted, could cause

a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-10323](/security/CVE-2018-10323))

Wen Xu discovered that the XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate xattr information. An attacker could use

this to construct a malicious xfs image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10840](/security/CVE-2018-10840))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly keep meta-data information consistent in some

situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image

that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-10881](/security/CVE-2018-10881))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle corrupted meta data in some situations. An

attacker could use this to specially craft an ext4 filesystem that caused a

denial of service (system crash) when mounted. ([CVE-2018-1093](/security/CVE-2018-1093))

Jann Horn discovered that the Linux kernel's implementation of random seed

data reported that it was in a ready state before it had gathered

sufficient entropy. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information. ([CVE-2018-1108](/security/CVE-2018-1108))

It was discovered that the procfs filesystem did not properly handle

processes mapping some memory elements onto files. A local attacker could

use this to block utilities that examine the procfs filesystem to report

operating system state, such as ps(1). ([CVE-2018-1120](/security/CVE-2018-1120))

Jann Horn discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly keep xattr information consistent in some

situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image

that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-11412](/security/CVE-2018-11412))

Piotr Gabriel Kosinski and Daniel Shapira discovered a stack-based buffer

overflow in the CDROM driver implementation of the Linux kernel. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-11506](/security/CVE-2018-11506))

Shankara Pailoor discovered that a race condition existed in the socket

handling code in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause

a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-12232](/security/CVE-2018-12232))

Shankara Pailoor discovered that the JFS filesystem implementation in the

Linux kernel contained a buffer overflow when handling extended attributes.

A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-12233](/security/CVE-2018-12233))

Felix Wilhelm discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel

did not properly perform permission checks in some situations when nested

virtualization is used. An attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this

to escape into an outer VM or the host OS. ([CVE-2018-12904](/security/CVE-2018-12904))

Wen Xu discovered that the XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle an error condition with a corrupted xfs

image. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious xfs image that,

when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-13094](/security/CVE-2018-13094))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly handle setgid file

creation when performed by a non-member of the group. A local attacker

could use this to gain elevated privileges. ([CVE-2018-13405](/security/CVE-2018-13405))

Silvio Cesare discovered that the generic VESA frame buffer driver in the

Linux kernel contained an integer overflow. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-13406](/security/CVE-2018-13406))

Jakub Jirasek discovered that multiple use-after-free errors existed in the

USB/IP implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-5814](/security/CVE-2018-5814))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ARM Advanced

Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA) driver in the Linux kernel that

could result in a double free. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-9415](/security/CVE-2018-9415))

It was discovered that an information leak existed in the generic SCSI

driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-1000204](/security/CVE-2018-1000204))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-33-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-33-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-33-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.
