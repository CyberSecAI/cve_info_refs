    "root_cause": "The Linux kernel's implementation of random seed data reported that it was in a ready state before it had gathered sufficient entropy.",

      "Insufficient entropy during early boot sequence."

   "The original fix for this issue had to be reverted because it caused the boot process to hang on many systems. In this version, the random driver has been updated, making it more effective in gathering entropy without needing a hardware RNG.",
   "Some users of the CRNG would access the random seed data before it was seeded to an acceptable value.",
   "Knowing this value would weaken cryptographic methods if the seed was able to be determined."
