# Security Bulletin: Multiple vulnerabilities in the IBM GSKit component of IBM Spectrum Protect (formerly Tivoli Storage Manager) for Virtual Environments: Data Protection for VMware

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

There are multiple vulnerabilities in the IBM GSKit component of IBM Spectrum Protect (formerly Tivoli Storage Manager) for Virtual Environments: Data Protection for VMware. IBM Spectrum Protect for Virtual Environments: Data Protection for VMware has addressed the applicable CVEs.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2016-0702](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0702) OpenSSL could allow a local attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a side-channel attack against a system based on the Intel Sandy-Bridge microarchitecture. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to recover RSA keys.

CVSS Base Score: 2.9

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111144> for the current score
