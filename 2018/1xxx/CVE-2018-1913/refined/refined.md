- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization, which allows for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within a user's browser session, potentially leading to credentials disclosure, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the web UI, where a malicious user can embed JavaScript code, which is then executed in the context of another userâ€™s session when they interact with the compromised element.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a user with the ability to embed JavaScript in the application. This is typically a low privilege. The vulnerability requires user interaction, where another user has to interact with the maliciously crafted content.
