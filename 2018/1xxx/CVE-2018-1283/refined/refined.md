  "CVE-2018-1283": {
    "description": "In Apache httpd 2.4.0 to 2.4.29, when mod_session is configured to forward its session data to CGI applications (SessionEnv on, not the default), a remote user may influence their content by using a \"Session\" header. This comes from the \"HTTP_SESSION\" variable name used by mod_session to forward its data to CGIs, since the prefix \"HTTP_\" is also used by the Apache HTTP Server to pass HTTP header fields, per CGI specifications.",
    "root_cause": "The mod_session module in Apache HTTP Server uses the \"HTTP_SESSION\" variable to forward session data to CGI applications. This variable is also used to pass HTTP header fields, which allows an attacker to inject their own session data through the \"Session\" header.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of HTTP headers",
      "Use of a variable name that overlaps with a CGI standard variable name"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can modify session data for CGI applications.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A remote attacker sends a crafted HTTP request with a 'Session' header."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server. The mod_session module must also have SessionEnv enabled in the configuration, which is not a default configuration."
