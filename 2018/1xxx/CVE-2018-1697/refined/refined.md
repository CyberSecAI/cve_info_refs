- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the MXAPIPERUSER object structure which provides information on users, people, and groups in Maximo. This structure was accessible to Work Center users, which allowed for the enumeration of usernames.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure due to insecure authorization settings.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated user can enumerate usernames by crafting a special HTTP request.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted HTTP request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An authenticated user within the application.
