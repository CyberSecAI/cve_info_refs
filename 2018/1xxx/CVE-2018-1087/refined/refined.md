{
  "CVE-2018-1087": {
    "Root cause": "The Linux kernel's KVM hypervisor incorrectly handled exceptions after a stack switch operation via `Mov SS` or `Pop SS` instructions. The processor does not deliver interrupts and exceptions during stack switching; instead, they are delivered after the first instruction following the stack switch.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper exception handling during stack switching in KVM hypervisor"
    ],
    "Impact": "An unprivileged KVM guest user could crash the guest operating system or potentially escalate privileges within the guest.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Exploiting the timing window between stack switch and exception delivery"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An unprivileged KVM guest user"
  }
}
