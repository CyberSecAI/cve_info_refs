    "cve_id": "CVE-2018-1096",
    "description": "It was found that an authenticated user can leverage the SELECT query condition to extract information regarding existence of various values in the database.\n\nWidget id is not properly escaped for save_positions action on the dashboard, leading to SQL injection possibility.\nThis only allows injecting conditions to the select conditions, as it is a prepared query it does not allow executing additional commands.",
    "affected_component": "foreman",
    "root_cause": "Improper handling of the widget id parameter in the dashboard controller's save_positions action.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL injection",
      "Input sanitization flaw"
     ],
    "impact": "An authenticated user can inject SQL conditions into SELECT queries, allowing them to extract information about the database.",
    "attack_vector": "By crafting a malicious 'widget id' parameter in a request to the dashboard controller.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the dashboard controller.",
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability is limited to injecting conditions to the SELECT query, and does not allow for executing arbitrary SQL commands due to the use of prepared statements."
