Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-1185:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an OS command injection flaw in the Admin CLI of EMC RecoverPoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically within the `test_snmp` function's "trap destination" parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application does not validate or sanitize the input provided for the trap destination (hostname/IP), leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary operating system commands on the affected system with root privileges.
- **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation leads to a complete compromise of the affected RecoverPoint system.
- **Escalation of Privileges:**  The vulnerability allows an attacker with restricted admin privileges to escape the restricted shell and obtain an interactive shell with root access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Admin CLI Interface:** The attack is performed through the Admin CLI of EMC RecoverPoint by using the `test_snmp` command.
- **Crafted Input:** The attacker crafts a malicious input string for the trap destination parameter that contains OS commands using shell metacharacters and command chaining, such as `/dev/null 2>&1 ; bash #`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Admin privileges:** The attacker needs to have existing admin level access to the EMC RecoverPoint system's CLI interface to use the vulnerable command.
- **Network Access:** Local network access to the device's CLI is needed as the exploitation is through the local CLI interface.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects EMC RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines versions prior to 5.1.1, EMC RecoverPoint version 5.1.0.0, and EMC RecoverPoint versions prior to 5.0.1.3.
- The exploit was tested on RecoverPoint for VMs 4.3 and RecoverPoint 4.4.SP1.P1.
- The vulnerability was discovered by researchers at Northrop Grumman.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 6.7 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
