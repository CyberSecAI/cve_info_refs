### Relevant Content:
The provided content describes a vulnerability in PackageKit, identified as CVE-2018-1106.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an authentication bypass vulnerability in `pk-transaction.c`. Specifically, when a reinstallation is allowed, the outcome of the authentication attempt is ignored and the installation continues.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Authentication bypass during package reinstallation, allowing local users to install signed packages without administrator privileges.
- Missing checks for downgrades, where some backends allow downgrading packages without admin authorization.
- Lack of sanitization of user-supplied input files in the `apt` backend, potentially leading to race conditions or other vulnerabilities.
- It seems that the `apt` backend does not perform proper signature checks for individual deb files, as it only validates repository signatures.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Local users can install or downgrade arbitrary packages, even without administrator authentication or proper authorization.
- Privileges can be escalated by installing packages with known vulnerabilities and exploiting them.
- Malicious code can be introduced into the system by installing crafted or modified packages with valid signatures.
- Outdated software can be installed, thus enabling potential security issues.
- System compromise via arbitrary code execution in scriptlets.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local attack vector: By using command-line utilities like `pkcon` to trigger the vulnerable code path.
- Network attack vector: A user downloads a malicious or vulnerable package from the internet and installs it locally.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local access to the system is required.
- User must have permission to run `pkcon` or equivalent PackageKit client commands.
- Ability to download signed package files.
