```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is caused by the lack of sanitization and validation of the 'userId' parameter in the '/survey/api/config' API endpoint. This parameter is directly injected into an SQL query, leading to SQL injection. Additionally, missing authentication for the survey application further exacerbates the vulnerability.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- SQL Injection
- Missing authentication

Impact of exploitation:
- An attacker can take over the server database.
- The confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system can be affected.
- Sensitive information could be obtained.

Attack vectors:
- The vulnerability is exposed through a web API endpoint: `/survey/api/config`.
- An attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request with a malicious 'userId' parameter.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker can be remote and unauthenticated.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
