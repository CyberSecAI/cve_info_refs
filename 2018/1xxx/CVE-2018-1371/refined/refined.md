- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An IBM MQ client connecting to an MQ queue manager can cause a SIGSEGV in the amqrmppa channel process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability exists within the amqrmppa channel process of IBM MQ. It is triggered by a client connecting to the queue manager, leading to a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to the termination of the amqrmppa channel process, which could disrupt MQ services.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious or malformed client connection to an IBM MQ queue manager.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to establish a client connection to the target IBM MQ queue manager.
