- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability allows an unprivileged, authenticated user to read arbitrary files on a node.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An unprivileged, authenticated user has the ability to read files they should not have access to.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain access to sensitive data by reading arbitrary files on the affected node.
- **Attack vectors**: An authenticated, unprivileged user can read arbitrary files on a GPFS node.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have an existing authenticated user account with access to a GPFS node.
