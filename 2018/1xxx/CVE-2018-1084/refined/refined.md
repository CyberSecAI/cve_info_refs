### Summary of CVE-2018-1084

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Integer overflow in the `authenticate_nss_2_3()` function within `exec/totemcrypto.c` of the Corosync library. Specifically, the `datalen` calculation is vulnerable to an integer overflow: `int datalen = *buf_len - hash_len[instance->crypto_hash_type];`

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Integer Overflow: The subtraction operation calculating datalen can wrap around leading to incorrect data lengths.
- Out-of-bounds Read: The integer overflow in `datalen` leads to out-of-bounds read during hash calculation which is used in the  `calculate_nss_hash()` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A crafted malicious packet can trigger the integer overflow and lead to an application crash due to out-of-bounds read, resulting in a denial of service.
- Potential Remote Code Execution: It was initially thought that remote code execution could be possible, but this was later downgraded to just a denial of service after further analysis.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability can be triggered via network packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Unauthenticated Remote Attacker: The attacker does not need any prior authentication and can send malicious packets remotely.

**Additional details from the content:**
- Affected component: `exec/totemcrypto.c:authenticate_nss_2_3()`
- Affected software: Corosync
- Fixed version: Corosync 2.4.4 and later
- Acknowledgement: Citrix Security Response Team reported this issue.
- Red Hat rated this update as having a security impact of Important.
- Debian assigned it as a denial of service and not remote code execution.
- The fix involves checking the packet length.

**In summary, CVE-2018-1084 is an integer overflow vulnerability in Corosync which can be exploited by sending a crafted network packet leading to a denial of service.**
