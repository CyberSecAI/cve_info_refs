Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the relevant vulnerability details:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-1179

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing DataSubBlock structures within GIF images. This insufficient validation can result in a read operation that goes beyond the allocated boundaries of a data structure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability. The application attempts to read data past the end of an allocated data structure.
- Information Disclosure Vulnerability: This out-of-bounds read can potentially leak sensitive information from the process' memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- The primary impact is information disclosure. Attackers can potentially obtain sensitive information from the application's memory space.
- Additionally, this vulnerability can be chained with other vulnerabilities to achieve further exploitation, such as arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector involves remote exploitation via a malicious GIF image.
- User interaction is required, as the target must either visit a malicious web page or open a malicious file that contains the crafted GIF image.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker needs to be able to create a malicious GIF image with a specially crafted DataSubBlock structure.
- The attacker needs to trick the victim into either browsing to a web page or opening a file that contains the malicious GIF image.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported to Foxit on 2017-12-19.
- Foxit has released an update to address the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Steven Seeley of Source Incite.
- The Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) assigned it the tracking number ZDI-18-317ZDI-CAN-5490.
- The CVSS score is 4.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N).

**Summary of Additional Details (not found in the official CVE description):**

- The vulnerability specifically targets how Foxit Reader parses DataSubBlock structures within GIF images.
- It's a buffer overflow (or, more precisely, an out-of-bounds read) vulnerability.
- User interaction is specifically mentioned as a requirement for successful exploitation.
