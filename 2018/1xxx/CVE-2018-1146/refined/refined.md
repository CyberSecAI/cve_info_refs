Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1146:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `set.cgi` script of the Belkin N750 router's firmware. An unauthenticated user can send a crafted HTTP request to this script to enable Telnet.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Default Configuration:** Telnet is disabled by default, but the router's web interface allows an attacker to enable it via a simple request.
- **Lack of Authentication/Authorization:** The `set.cgi` script does not require any authentication to enable Telnet.
- **No Password Requirement for Telnet:** Once enabled, the Telnet service does not require a password, giving any user root access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Full System Compromise:**  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain root access to the router without any authentication. This allows the attacker to perform any administrative actions on the router, including changing configuration, installing backdoors, and using the router as a pivot point for further attacks in the network.
- **Network Exposure:** A compromised router can be used to eavesdrop on network traffic, redirect traffic, or launch attacks on other devices within the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the router's web interface using the `set.cgi` endpoint.
- The specific request that enables Telnet is:
  ```
  http://<router_ip>:8080/set.cgi?n=TLNET_EN&v=1
  ```

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Belkin N750 router to send the malicious HTTP request, and needs to be able to reach the telnet port after it has been enabled.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attack does not require any prior knowledge of credentials or authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability requires a reboot of the router after sending the malicious request for the telnet service to be activated
- This vulnerability is present in Belkin N750 F9K1103 v1 with firmware version 1.10.22.
- There is currently no patch for this vulnerability.
