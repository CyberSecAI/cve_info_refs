- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Monitoring Agent for WebSphere Applications may reveal sensitive personal information when the diagnostics or transaction tracking capability of the agent is used. This information is potentially exposed to staff with access to the Cloud APM product database.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information exposure through diagnostic or transaction tracking features of the agent.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Sensitive personal information can be revealed to unauthorized personnel, leading to potential privacy violations.
- **Attack vectors**: Access to the Cloud APM product database.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have access to the database of the Cloud APM product. This would typically be staff who have authorized access to the system, not an external attack vector.
