Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1277:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the Cloud Foundry Garden-runC component, where it fails to properly enforce disk quotas for Docker image layers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inadequate disk quota enforcement for Docker image layers.
- Failure to account for the actual disk space consumed by Docker image layers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote authenticated user can push an application with a malicious Docker image.
- This malicious image consumes more disk space on a Diego cell than allocated by the user's quota.
- This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the Diego cell due to excessive resource consumption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attack via application pushing.
- Requires the attacker to be authenticated.
- Exploits the lack of proper disk quota checks when dealing with Docker image layers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated user within a Cloud Foundry environment.
- Ability to push applications to the platform.
- Knowledge to create a malicious Docker image designed to consume excessive disk space.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is rated as high severity.
- The issue was responsibly reported by the Garden team.
- Fixed versions of the software include `garden-runc-release version 1.13.0` and `cf-deployment version 1.28.0`.
