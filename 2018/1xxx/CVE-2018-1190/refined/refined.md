- **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** Attackers could redirect users to phishing sites or sites that host malware.
- **Defacement:** The page could be modified to display malicious or unwanted content.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Maliciously crafted URL:** The attacker crafts a URL that includes the malicious script in the `clientId` parameter when accessing the UAA OpenID Connect check session iframe endpoint.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker might try to trick users into clicking on a malicious link containing the crafted URL or inject such links into other web resources.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to construct a URL that contains the malicious script in the `clientId` parameter.
