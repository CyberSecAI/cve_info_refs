  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2018-1262",
    "description": "UAA, versions 4.12.X and 4.13.X, introduced a feature which could allow privilege escalation across identity zones for clients performing offline validation. A zone administrator could configure their zone to issue tokens which impersonate another zone, granting up to admin privileges in the impersonated zone for clients performing offline token validation.",
    "affected_products": [
      "uaa-release versions v57, v57.1 or v58",
      "uaa versions 4.12.x or 4.13.x",
      "cf-deployment versions v1.27.0 through v1.31.0"
    ],
    "root_cause": "A feature introduced in UAA versions 4.12.X and 4.13.X allows for privilege escalation across identity zones during offline token validation.",
     "weakness": "The vulnerability lies in the UAA's token issuance process where a zone administrator can configure their zone to issue tokens that can be used to impersonate another zone, leading to unauthorized access.",
    "impact": "A successful exploit could grant up to admin privileges in the impersonated zone for clients performing offline token validation.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector involves a zone administrator configuring their zone to issue tokens that impersonate another zone. Clients performing offline token validation are then vulnerable.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be a zone administrator to configure the token issuance process in a way that it can impersonate another zone. The attacker also needs a client that performs offline token validation."
