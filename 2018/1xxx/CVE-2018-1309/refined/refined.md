Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1309:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of XML external entity references within the `SplitXml` processor of Apache NiFi. Specifically, the processor was not restricting XML External Entity (XXE) references.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The `SplitXml` processor was vulnerable to XXE injection, allowing processing of malicious XML documents. The processor did not disable Document Type Declarations (DTDs) or prevent the resolution of XML external entities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data on the server by crafting a malicious XML document that includes external entity references.
- **Remote Code Execution (Potentially):** In some configurations, XXE vulnerabilities can lead to remote code execution. This occurs if the XML parser processes a crafted external entity to execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can craft a malicious XML document that contains Document Type Declarations (DTDs) with XML external entity references. When processed by a vulnerable instance of the `SplitXml` processor, these references may lead to external access to resources, potentially disclosing information or leading to code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject a malicious XML document into a NiFi flow that utilizes the vulnerable `SplitXml` processor.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated. The vulnerability is triggered by processing of crafted XML documents.
- No specific knowledge about the NiFi setup is needed beyond the knowledge that it uses the vulnerable `SplitXml` processor.

**Additional Details:**

- This vulnerability is specific to the `SplitXml` processor in Apache NiFi.
- The fix for this vulnerability was released in Apache NiFi version 1.6.0.
- The fix involves disabling external general entity parsing and disallowing document type declarations within the SplitXml processor, which prevents it from resolving external entity references.
