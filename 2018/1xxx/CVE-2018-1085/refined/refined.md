Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1085:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from incorrectly quoted values within the `etcd.conf` file. Specifically, the values assigned to `ETCD_CLIENT_CERT_AUTH` and `ETCD_PEER_CLIENT_CERT_AUTH` were enclosed in quotes (e.g., `ETCD_CLIENT_CERT_AUTH="true"`). This misconfiguration caused `etcd` to interpret these values as strings instead of boolean values, effectively disabling SSL client certificate authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Configuration:** The primary vulnerability is the incorrect configuration of `etcd.conf` file.
*   **Disabled Authentication:**  SSL client certificate authentication was unintentionally disabled due to the incorrect quotes around the boolean values, leading to a security bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Remote users could connect to the `etcd` server without any authentication, if they could access the `etcd` server bound to the network on master nodes.
*   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could read and modify all the data about the OpenShift cluster stored in the `etcd` datastore.
*   **Cluster Compromise:** This could lead to various malicious activities such as adding rogue compute nodes or even bringing down the entire cluster.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker would need network access to the `etcd` server, specifically on the master nodes, to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must have network access to the etcd server on the master nodes.
*   **No Authentication Required (Due to Vulnerability):** Due to the misconfiguration, the attacker does not need valid client certificates, or any authentication credentials to connect to `etcd`.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Environments:** This vulnerability specifically affected OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) deployments that used the containerized installation method for `etcd` versions 3.7.1-3.6.
*   **Mitigation:** Removing quotes from `ETCD_CLIENT_CERT_AUTH` and `ETCD_PEER_CLIENT_CERT_AUTH` in `/etc/etcd/etcd.conf` and restarting the `etcd` container service was the recommended mitigation.
*   **Fixed Versions:** The vulnerability was fixed in `openshift-ansible` versions 3.9.23-1 and 3.7.46-1.
*   **Errata:** The fix was released via Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2018:2013
