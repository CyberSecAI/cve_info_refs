Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): v3.9.7   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1558183#c7)  N. Harrison Ripps    2018-03-21 14:22:28 UTC  ``` Merged 3.9 PR.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1558183#c9)  liujia    2018-03-22 09:01:07 UTC  ``` Due to revert pr related with [bz1548358](show_bug.cgi?id=1548358 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - Containerized upgrade failed at TASK [openshift_node : Wait for node to be ready] for container on rhel"). Do some regression test based latest build openshift-ansible-3.9.13-1.git.0.47b616a.el7.noarch.  1) Run upgrade against non-ha deployed containerized ocp on rhel.  upgrade succeed. 2) Run upgrade against ha deployed coordinated ocp on rhel. upgrade succeed.  Please help confirm if that's enough for the regression test about revert pr.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1558183#c10)  DeShuai Ma    2018-03-22 10:05:10 UTC  ``` DevExp: We have triggered more than 50 builds in parallel and make sure all pods are assigned to one node, didn't meet the issue like the bug said.

No issue now. make the bug verified. For online starter-ca-central-1 we'd better clone a bug then after online upgrade to 3.9.13 verify it.   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1557822#c0)  Sam Fowler    2018-03-19 01:45:14 UTC  ``` OpenShift and Atomic Enterprise Ansible deploys a misconfigured etcd file that causes SSL client certificate authentication to be disabled. Quotations around the values of ETCD_CLIENT_CERT_AUTH and ETCD_PEER_CLIENT_CERT_AUTH in etcd.conf result in etcd being configured to allow remote users to connect without any authentication.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1557822#c1)  Sam Fowler    2018-03-19 01:45:20 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: David Hocky (Comcast)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1557822#c5)  Sam Fowler    2018-03-19 23:30:38 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1557821](show_bug.cgi?id=1557821) has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1557822#c13)  Jason Shepherd    2018-03-23 02:59:16 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects Openshift Container Platform (OCP) only if you use the container installation method. The container installation method is tech preview in 3.7.1. This issue affected all users who did a containerized etcd in OCP versions 3.7.1-3.6.  If etcd is installed via RPM and run via '/usr/bin/etcd' it's not affected by this flaw. You can check if etcd is being run from '/usr//bin/etcd' using a 'ps' command such as this on the master nodes. If Installed via RPM you should get output similar to:  ps -ef | grep etcd $/usr/bin/etcd --name=master-0.example.com --data-dir=/var/lib/etcd/ --listen-client-urls=<https://10.0.1.1:2379>  If etcd is installed via the container method running 'docker ps' on the master will show a container running the registry.access.redhat.com/rhel7/etcd image, eg:  sudo docker ps --filter name=etcd_container $704effa9b0cc        registry.access.redhat.com/rhel7/etcd   "/usr/bin/etcd"     56 minutes ago      Up 56 minutes                           etcd_container   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1557822#c14)  Jason Shepherd    2018-03-26 05:39:18 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  On master nodes where etcd has been installed using the container method:  0. Verify you can connect to etcd without providing TLS authentication credentials. On any master node, check the ETCD_LISTEN_CLIENT_URLS in /etc/etcd/etcd.conf, and use one of the client urls to connect without providing a certificate, eg:    curl -4 curl <https://10.0.1.1:2379/version> -k  0a. If vulnerable output will show something like this:    {"etcdserver":"3.2.15","etcdcluster":"3.2.0"}  0b. If not affected the connection will fail with:     curl: (58) NSS: client certificate not found (nickname not specified)  1. update /etc/etcd/etcd.conf on the master nodes to remove quotes from these fields:    ETCD_PEER_CLIENT_CERT_AUTH="true"    ETCD_CLIENT_CERT_AUTH="true" eg.    ETCD_PEER_CLIENT_CERT_AUTH=true    ETCD_CLIENT_CERT_AUTH=true  2. Restart the etcd container service:    sudo systemctl restart etcd_container  3. Test if client authentication is now required using the steps from 0. above.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1557822#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-06-27 18:01:17 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.9  Via RHSA-2018:2013 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2013](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2013)   ``` |  |

## Topic

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release 3.9.31 is now available with updates to packages and images that address security issues, fix several bugs, and add enhancements.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is the company's cloud computing Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution designed for on-premise or private cloud deployments.

This advisory contains the RPM packages for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.9.31. See the following advisory for the container images for this release:

[https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2018:2014](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2018%3A2014)

Security Fix(es):

* routing: Malicious Service configuration can bring down routing for an entire shard (CVE-2018-1070)
* openshift-ansible: Incorrectly quoted values in etcd.conf causes disabling of SSL client certificate authentication (CVE-2018-1085)
* source-to-image: Builder images with assembler-user LABEL set to root allows attackers to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2018-10843)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank David Hocky (Comcast) for reporting CVE-2018-1085. The CVE-2018-1070 issue was discovered by Mark Chappell (Red Hat) and the CVE-2018-10843 issue was discovered by Jeremy Choi (Red Hat).

<https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.9/release_notes/ocp_3_9_release_notes.html>

All OpenShift Container Platform 3.9 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages and images.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1557822#c0)  Sam Fowler    2018-03-19 01:45:14 UTC  ``` OpenShift and Atomic Enterprise Ansible deploys a misconfigured etcd file that causes SSL client certificate authentication to be disabled. Quotations around the values of ETCD_CLIENT_CERT_AUTH and ETCD_PEER_CLIENT_CERT_AUTH in etcd.conf result in etcd being configured to allow remote users to connect without any authentication.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1557822#c1)  Sam Fowler    2018-03-19 01:45:20 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: David Hocky (Comcast)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1557822#c5)  Sam Fowler    2018-03-19 23:30:38 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1557821](show_bug.cgi?id=1557821) has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1557822#c13)  Jason Shepherd    2018-03-23 02:59:16 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects Openshift Container Platform (OCP) only if you use the container installation method. The container installation method is tech preview in 3.7.1. This issue affected all users who did a containerized etcd in OCP versions 3.7.1-3.6.  If etcd is installed via RPM and run via '/usr/bin/etcd' it's not affected by this flaw. You can check if etcd is being run from '/usr//bin/etcd' using a 'ps' command such as this on the master nodes. If Installed via RPM you should get output similar to:  ps -ef | grep etcd $/usr/bin/etcd --name=master-0.example.com --data-dir=/var/lib/etcd/ --listen-client-urls=<https://10.0.1.1:2379>  If etcd is installed via the container method running 'docker ps' on the master will show a container running the registry.access.redhat.com/rhel7/etcd image, eg:  sudo docker ps --filter name=etcd_container $704effa9b0cc        registry.access.redhat.com/rhel7/etcd   "/usr/bin/etcd"     56 minutes ago      Up 56 minutes                           etcd_container   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1557822#c14)  Jason Shepherd    2018-03-26 05:39:18 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  On master nodes where etcd has been installed using the container method:  0. Verify you can connect to etcd without providing TLS authentication credentials. On any master node, check the ETCD_LISTEN_CLIENT_URLS in /etc/etcd/etcd.conf, and use one of the client urls to connect without providing a certificate, eg:    curl -4 curl <https://10.0.1.1:2379/version> -k  0a. If vulnerable output will show something like this:    {"etcdserver":"3.2.15","etcdcluster":"3.2.0"}  0b.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
