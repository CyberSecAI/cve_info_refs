The provided content contains information about CVE-2018-1255.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
A remote unauthenticated attacker could trick a victim application user to supply malicious HTML or JavaScript code to a vulnerable web application. This code is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser, which can lead to various malicious actions, such as stealing session cookies or redirecting the user to a malicious website.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by tricking a victim into supplying malicious code through a vulnerable web application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious HTML or JavaScript code and then trick a victim into interacting with a vulnerable web application by supplying the crafted code, typically via a crafted link. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the application.
