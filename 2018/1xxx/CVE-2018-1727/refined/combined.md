# Security Bulletin: IBM InfoSphere Information Server is potentially vulnerable to XML External Entity Injection (XXE)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

An XML External Entity Injection (XXE) vulnerability in InfoSphere Information Server Manager can potentially be used by an attacker to retrieve sensitive documents.

## Vulnerability Details

CVEID: [CVE-2018-1727](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1727)

DESCRIPTION: IBM InfoSphere Information Server is vulnerable to a XML External Entity Injection (XXE) attack when processing XML data. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to expose sensitive information or consume memory resources.

CVSS Base Score: 7.1

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/147630> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:L)

## Affected Products and Versions

The following products, running on all supported platforms, are affected:

IBM InfoSphere Information Server: versions 9.1, 11.3, 11.5, and 11.7

IBM InfoSphere Information Server on Cloud: versions 11.5, and 11.7

## Remediation/Fixes

None

## Workarounds and Mitigations

For all releases of Information Server Manager:

• Avoid using the XML import option. Instead, use the ADD button to add site and link functionality information where possible.

• If XML format has to be used for import, manually check the XML file before importing the file to determine if there is a DTD / DOCTYPE section or any other section apart from SITE tag. DTD sections are not required in XML files used with Information Server Manager, and if present, they can be safely removed before importing. IBM recommends manually checking the XML file content before importing the file. If there is a DTD / DOCTYPE section, verify its contents for any unexpected content.

Sample XML for import:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
