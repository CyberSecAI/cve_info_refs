  "CVE-2018-1088": {
    "description": "A privilege escalation flaw was found in gluster 3.x snapshot scheduler. Any gluster client allowed to mount gluster volumes could also mount shared gluster storage volume and escalate privileges by scheduling malicious cronjob via symlink.",
    "technical_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how the gluster snapshot scheduler creates a symlink to a cron configuration file within a shared gluster volume. This symlink is created in `/etc/cron.d`, which means cron jobs specified in the file targeted by the symlink are executed as root.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Privilege escalation due to the ability to write cron configuration to shared storage."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution as root on Gluster server nodes.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker needs network access to a Gluster server node to mount the shared storage volume. An attacker must be able to mount and write to the `gluster_shared_storage` volume.",
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to mount and write to the `gluster_shared_storage` volume. This is done via a client capable of mounting gluster volumes. In unmitigated configurations, any gluster client can mount the `gluster_shared_storage` volume."
