Debian Bug     : 909215

Multiple security vulnerabilities were discovered in GlusterFS, a
clustered file system. Buffer overflows and path traversal issues may
lead to information disclosure, denial-of-service or the execution of
arbitrary code.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
3.8.8-1+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your glusterfs packages.

For the detailed security status of glusterfs please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/glusterfs>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

This generator uses a list of all local LVM volume groups to create boot arguments, but systems with local storage domains on separate volume groups are currently present in the list, which could result in incorrect flags being in the grub.conf file. This update enables RHVH grub generators to explicitly look for the RHVH volume group, and ignore others. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2018-05-15 17:57:47 UTC | | | oVirt Team: | Node | | | Target Upstream Version: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | | Flags: | lsvaty: testing\_plan\_complete- | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1561258#c0)  Germano Veit Michel    2018-03-28 00:36:04 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  While attempting to run grub2-mkconfig on RHVH, the produced configuration file is incorrect if the host contains another local VG other than rhvh.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): RHVH-4.1-20180315.0-RHVH-x86_64-dvd1.iso  How reproducible: 100%  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Have vm local storage on the host. For example:  # vgs   VG        #PV #LV #SN Attr   VSize    VFree     rhvh        1  10   0 wz--n-  <74.00g <13.84g   vg_vmpool   1   1   0 wz--n- 1020.00m 508.00m  # grep vmpool /etc/fstab  /dev/mapper/vg_vmpool-lv_vmpool /data xfs defaults 0 0  2. Install a hotfix kernel rpm -Uvh kernel-1.2.3 cp /boot/*1.2.3* /boot/$(imgbase layer --current) grub2-mkconfig -o /etc/grub2.cfg (or /etc/grub2-efi.cfg if EFI)  Actual results: grub2.cfg contains incorrect info. It appended both vg names: root=/dev/rhvhvg_vmpool/rhvh-4.1-0.20180314.0+1 rd.lvm.lv=rhvhvg_vmpool/rhvh-4.1-0.20180314.0+1  Expected results: root=/dev/rhvh/rhvh-4.1-0.20180314.0+1 rd.lvm.lv=rhvh/rhvh-4.1-0.20180314.0+1   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1561258#c2)  Ryan Barry    2018-03-28 01:58:11 UTC  ``` This is definitely not related to a new kernel   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1561258#c3)  jiachen zhang    2018-04-04 02:46:43 UTC  ``` I can reproduce this bug successfully, and the key step as follow: To creat a vg in kickstart:  ### Partitioning ### #ignoredisk --drives=sda zerombr clearpart --all bootloader --location=mbr reqpart --add-boot part pv.01 --ondisk=/dev/sda --size=300000 part pv.02 --ondisk=/dev/sda --size=100000 volgroup rhvh pv.01 --reserved-percent=2 volgroup test pv.02 logvol swap --fstype=swap --name=swap --vgname=rhvh --recommended logvol none --name=pool --vgname=rhvh --thinpool --size=200000 --grow logvol / --fstype=ext4 --name=root --vgname=rhvh --thin --poolname=pool --size=100000 --grow logvol /var --fstype=ext4 --name=var --vgname=rhvh --thin --poolname=pool --size=20000 logvol /data --fstype=xfs --name=data --vgname=test --size=50000  then we will have two vg.  Then find the suitable kernal to update it.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1561258#c5)  jiachen zhang    2018-05-09 09:01:40 UTC  ``` Test this bug with the version redhat-virtualization-host-4.2-20180507.0 Original Kernel: kernel-3.10.0-862-2.3 After run the command "rpm -Uvh", upgraded the kernel to kernel-3.10.0-862 Follow the steps I got the correct results.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1558721#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2018-03-20 21:30:53 UTC  ``` As reported:  When certain options are enabled in Gluster, it creates a volume called gluster_shared_storage. This volume is mounted on each server in the cluster and used to share state. The volume is not intended to be mounted by storage clients as it does not contain any data that is intended to be user accessi= ble.   When snapshot scheduling is enabled in Gluster, this gluster_shared_storage volume is used to coordinate the snapshots. Part of that is sharing the cron job that is used to trigger scheduled snaps. The crontab file exposed in the shared volume is symlinked into each server's /etc/cron.d directory.   By default, the shared_storage volume can be mounted by any client that has access to the cluster to mount data volumes. Further, since Gluster relies = on client-reported uids, the shared_storage volume can be written from any of these clients, permitting cron entries to be added to the system crontab directory such that they will be executed by each server as root (or any ot= her uid).   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1558721#c8)  Pedro Sampaio    2018-03-22 11:31:36 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: John Strunk (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=1558721#c27)  Doran Moppert    2018-04-18 06:52:26 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  To limit exposure of gluster server nodes :    1. gluster server should be on LAN and not reachable from public networks.   2. Use gluster auth.allow and auth.reject.   3. Use TLS certificates between gluster server nodes and clients.    Caveat: This would only mitigate attacks from unauthorized malicious clients. gluster clients allowed by auth.allow or having signed TLS client certificates would still be able to trigger this attack.   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=1558721#c28)  Siddharth Sharma    2018-04-18 10:02:35 UTC  ``` Created glusterfs tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1568832](show_bug.cgi?id=1568832 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-1088 glusterfs: Privilege escalation via gluster_shared_storage when snapshot scheduling is enabled [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=1558721#c29)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-04-18 12:04:25 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.3 for RHEL 6   Native Client for RHEL 6 for Red Hat Storage  Via RHSA-2018:1137 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:1137](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A1137)   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=1558721#c30)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-04-18 12:06:19 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.3 for RHEL 7   Native Client for RHEL 7 for Red Hat Storage  Via RHSA-2018:1136 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:1136](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A1136)   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=1558721#c31)  Siddharth Sharma    2018-04-19 10:22:56 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://access.redhat.com/articles/3414511>   ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=1558721#c32)  Siddharth Sharma    2018-04-19 17:28:50 UTC  ``` upstream fixes:  <https://review.gluster.org/#/c/19899/> <https://review.gluster.org/#/c/19898/>   ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=1558721#c33)  Siddharth Sharma    2018-04-27 10:09:24 UTC  ``` Statement:  This vulnerability affects gluster servers that have, or have previously had, Gluster volume snapshot scheduling enabled from the CLI. Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization supports volume snapshot scheduling from the Web UI, which uses a distinct mechanism that is not subject to this vulnerability. VM snapshots are not impacted by this flaw. For more information, please see the Vulnerability Article linked under External References.  This issue did not affect the versions of glusterfs as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, and 7 because only gluster client is shipped in these products. [CVE-2018-1088](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1088) affects glusterfs-server package as shipped with Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.   ```  [Comment 34](show_bug.cgi?id=1558721#c34)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-05-02 13:14:55 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Virtualization 4 for RHEL-7  Via RHSA-2018:1275 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:1275](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A1275)   ```  [Comment 35](show_bug.cgi?id=1558721#c35)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-05-15 17:38:54 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Virtualization 4 for RHEL-7  Via RHSA-2018:1524 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:1524](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A1524)   ``` |  |

# CVE-2018-10907

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2018-10906.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2018-10910.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2018-10907 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10907)

#### Description

It was found that glusterfs server is vulnerable to multiple stack based buffer overflows due to functions in server-rpc-fopc.c allocating fixed size buffers using 'alloca(3)'. An authenticated attacker could exploit this by mounting a gluster volume and sending a string longer that the fixed buffer size to cause crash or potential code execution.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

# CVE-2018-1088 glusterfs: Privilege escalation via gluster\_shared\_storage when snapshot scheduling is enabled

Updated 2018-04-19T20:35:50+00:00 -
English

* No translations currently exist.

## Environment

Red Hat Gluster Storage 3

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization

## Issue

This flaw is based on a symlink (symbolic link) attack. Any glusterfs client with access to a gluster node, can mount `gluster_shared_storage` volume without authentication. This volume contains a file which is the target of a symlink from `/etc/cron.d`, and can be used to configure cron jobs for arbitrary users. After mounting `gluster_shared_storage`, the client can overwrite this file to schedule a cron job which would run as root. This would lead to privilege escalation on the gluster server.

The dangerous symlink is created when gluster snapshot scheduling is enabled. This requires a gluster administrator to run `snap_scheduler.py init`, using the script included in the `glusterfs-server` package. Note that if snapshot scheduling is later disabled, the symlink is not automatically removed so your system may remain vulnerable.

## Case Scenario

```
Server-A, Server-B, Server-C    - glusterfs servers
Client-B                        - glusterfs client

```

1. Gluster server admin creates `gluster_shared_storage volume` on all glusterfs server nodes (Server-A,Server-B,Server-C) for snapshot scheduling.
2. Gluster server admin then executes `snap_scheduler.py init` on Server-A, resulting in creation of:
   * `glusterfs_snap_cron_tasks` file within `gluster_shared_storage_volume`
   * `/etc/cron.d/glusterfs_snap_cron_tasks` (symbolic link to the above file)
3. `gluster_shared_storage` volume can be mounted without authentication by any gluster client (including Client-B)
4. Client-B mounts this volume read/write, and creates arbitrary/malicious entries in `glusterfs_snap_cron_tasks`
5. Cron jobs created in `glusterfs_snap_cron_tasks` are executed on Server-A, as the local root user

## Impact

Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue Important. This flaw could be use to execute malicious cronjobs resulting in privilege escalation and arbitrary command execution on gluster server nodes.

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization does not use the `snap_scheduler.py` script by default: snapshots configured through the web UI use a different mechanism that does not expose this vulnerability. However, if `snap_scheduler.py` has ever been used from the command line on a hypervisor, that host may be vulnerable. Administrators can determine if their systems are vulnerable by following the steps in "Detection" section below.

## Resolution

Mitigations are described below. Patches for all affected components will be made available in future updates.

## Detection

If snapshot scheduling has ever been enabled on your system, it may be vulnerable. You can test for this using the following steps (`#` represents the root shell prompt):

```
    # gluster volume get all cluster.enable-shared-storage
    Option                                Value
    -------                               -----
    cluster.enable-shared-storage         disable

```

If the output says `disable` (as above), you are safe. If the output says `enable`, also run the following command:

```
    # ls -l /etc/cron.d/glusterfs_snap_cron_tasks

```

If the output says `ls: No such file or directory`, you are safe. If the output shows a symbolic link to `/var/run/gluster/shared_storage/...`, your system is vulnerable and should be upgraded with the packages listed below.

## Mitigation

1. gluster server should be on LAN and not reachable from public networks.
2. Use gluster auth.allow and auth.reject.
3. Use TLS certificates between gluster server nodes and clients.

Caveat: This would only mitigate attacks from unauthorized malicious clients. gluster clients allowed by auth.allow or having signed TLS certificates for clients would still be able to trigger this attack.

## Errata

This issue was resolved with the release of the following Security Errata.

Red Hat Gluster Storage 3

[RHSA-2018:1136](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A1136)

[RHSA-2018:1137](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A1137)

## Root Cause

By architecture, gluster allows all clients to mount any volume, including the shared storage volume involved in this vulnerability. If at any point the gluster snapshot scheduler is enabled (by running `snap_scheduler.py init`) it will create a symlink in `/etc/cron.d` which is owned by root. Any user who is able to mount the gluster shared storage volume can then schedule cronjobs.
