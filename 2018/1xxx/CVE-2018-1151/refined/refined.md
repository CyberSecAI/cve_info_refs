Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2018-1151:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `toServerValue.cgi` script of the Western Digital TV Media Player and Live Hub devices. The vulnerability occurs when processing JSON data sent to the script, specifically the "DEVICENAME" field.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable script.
*   **Stack Buffer Overflow:** By sending a large string in the "DEVICENAME" field, an attacker can overwrite the stack, leading to a crash and potentially arbitrary code execution.
*  **Lack of input validation:** The `toServerValue.cgi` script does not properly validate the size of the input provided in the `DEVICENAME` field.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected devices, potentially gaining complete control.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Sending a large string to the `toServerValue.cgi` script can also cause a denial of service by crashing the device.
*   **Full device compromise:** Because the webserver runs as root, successful exploitation leads to complete compromise of the device.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Network-based attack:** The vulnerability is exploited over the network using HTTP requests.
*   **Unauthenticated:** No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Network access:** The attacker must be able to reach the vulnerable device over the network.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable script:** The attacker must know the URL of the `toServerValue.cgi` script to send the crafted request.
*   **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker needs a tool like `curl` or similar to send crafted HTTP POST requests.
*   **No specific privilege required:** The attacker does not need any credentials to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered while analyzing a prior security advisory from SEC Consult regarding similar vulnerabilities in these devices.
*   The HTTP server is configured to run as root, which amplifies the impact of successful exploitation.
*   The vulnerability affects Western Digital TV Media Player 1.03.07 and TV Live Hub 3.12.13.
*   No patch or fix for the vulnerability is available. The recommendation is to isolate these devices as much as possible due to lack of patching.
