- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in Rational DOORS Next Generation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts into the application, which would then be executed in the browsers of other users. This could lead to various impacts, including:
    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing sensitive information
    - Defacing the application
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the injection of malicious scripts, likely through user-supplied input or data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to have the ability to inject malicious code into the application. This could potentially be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in input validation or other security flaws. The attacker would likely not need privileged access to the application to inject the malicious script.

The provided information includes affected versions, remediation steps, and other standard security bulletin details, but it doesn't specify the exact location or method of the XSS injection.
