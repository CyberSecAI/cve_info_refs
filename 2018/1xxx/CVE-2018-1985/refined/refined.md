- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in a driver bundled with IBM Security Trusteer Rapport for MacOS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow in the driver.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The provided text does not explicitly state the impact of exploitation, but a buffer overflow can lead to a variety of issues, including denial of service, arbitrary code execution, or system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is not detailed, but it involves exploiting the buffer overflow in the vulnerable driver.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The required attacker capabilities are not explicitly mentioned, but an attacker would need to be able to interact with the vulnerable driver to trigger the overflow. It is not mentioned whether local or remote access would be required.
