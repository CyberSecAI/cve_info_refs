Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2018-1126:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The provided text explicitly mentions `CVE-2018-1126` and describes it as an "incorrect integer size in proc/alloc.\* leading to truncation/integer overflow issues," which aligns with the official CVE description.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability (CVE-2018-1126):**
   - The core issue lies in the `xrealloc` function within the `procps-ng` library. This function used an `unsigned int` for size calculations, instead of the appropriate `size_t`. On 64-bit systems, where `size_t` is larger than `unsigned int`, this discrepancy could cause integer truncation when very large sizes were requested for memory allocation, leading to a heap overflow when used by the `file2strvec` function, which is exploited in `CVE-2018-1124`.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Integer Overflow:** Specifically, the integer overflow occurred within `file2strvec`, leading to an incorrect size calculation. This is because the `xrealloc` used an `unsigned int size` argument instead of a size_t.
   - **Heap Overflow:** The integer overflow in xrealloc leads to a heap-based buffer overflow when copying data with `memcpy()`.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Local Privilege Escalation (LPE):** A local attacker who can create entries in procfs by starting processes, could trigger the integer overflow in the `file2strvec` function when other users execute vulnerable `procps-ng` utilities such as pgrep, pidof, pkill, and w. This can then lead to arbitrary code execution by the attacker.
   - **Container Escape:** An attacker's process within a container could trigger the vulnerability in a utility running outside the container, enabling the attacker to break out of the container or chroot.
   - **Denial of Service:** Integer overflows can lead to crashes due to memory corruption.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Local:** The attack requires local access to the system.
   - **Procfs manipulation**: By creating entries in procfs (via starting processes) or by providing overly long command line arguments, an attacker can cause the integer overflow in the library.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Local Access:** An attacker must be able to run a process that can create a large number of command line arguments.
   - **Ability to influence command execution:** The attack relies on the victim user or process calling a vulnerable `procps-ng` utility.
   - On some platforms, the attacker requires control of the execution environment to the point where HOME is unset, in order to trigger CVE-2018-1122 in top.

**Additional Notes:**
   - The vulnerability is present in `procps-ng` versions before 3.3.15.
   -  The provided information also highlights that the vulnerability is also linked to `CVE-2018-1124` due to integer overflow present in the `file2strvec` function
   - Some mitigations exist in place, such as the `FORTIFY` flag, which limits some exploits to a crash (denial of service) rather than arbitrary code execution.
   - Red Hat and SUSE, among others, provide patches for the vulnerability.
   - The Qualys advisory suggests that a FUSE filesystem could be used to exploit the vulnerability reliably.
   - Exploits against `w` have been developed for both non-PIE and PIE systems.
