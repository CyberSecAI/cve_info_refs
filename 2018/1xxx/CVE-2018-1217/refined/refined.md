Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-1217

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a missing access control check within the Dell EMC Avamar Installation Manager component. This allows unauthenticated remote attackers to interact with the system in unauthorized ways.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Missing Functional Level Access Control:** An unauthenticated user can add a Dell EMC Support Account to the Installation Manager.
2.  **Plain Text Credential Exposure:** An unauthenticated user can retrieve Dell EMC Support Account credentials in plain text.
3.  **Improper Validation of Support Passcode:** An authenticated user can bypass support account lock using an invalid password with a tampered server response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
1.  **Adding Unauthorized Support Account:** An attacker can add their own support account, potentially gaining unauthorized access or control over updates and other features.
2.  **Credential Theft:** The attacker can obtain the plain text credentials for the Dell EMC Support Account. This allows an attacker to impersonate the AVI service and log in to Dell EMC Online Support.
3.  **Bypass Support Account Lock:** Attackers can unlock support accounts to download verbose logs.
4.  **Denial of Service:** If the LDLS configuration is changed to an invalid configuration the Avamar Installation Manager may not be able to connect to Dell EMC online support.

**Attack Vectors:**
Remote unauthenticated attackers can send specifically crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable Avamar Installation Manager component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target Avamar server on the network. No authentication is required to add a support account and retrieve the credentials. For the bypass of the support account lock, an authenticated user is required, but an invalid passcode is sufficient when tampering with the server's response.
