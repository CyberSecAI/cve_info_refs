- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM API Connect Developer Portal is vulnerable to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application does not properly validate user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to craft malicious input parameters that trick the server into making requests within the trusted network.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can use this vulnerability to make potentially malicious calls within the internal network, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or performing unauthorized actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed by sending specially crafted input parameters to the vulnerable server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any privileges or user interaction to exploit this vulnerability, and can perform the attack remotely over the network.
