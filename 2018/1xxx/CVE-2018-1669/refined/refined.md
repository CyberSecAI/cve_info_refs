- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to improper handling of XML data, making it susceptible to XML External Entity Injection (XXE) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the presence of an XXE vulnerability. This allows an attacker to inject external entities into the XML processing.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to the exposure of sensitive information or the consumption of memory resources.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted XML data to the vulnerable IBM DataPower Gateway. The attacker requires low privileges.
