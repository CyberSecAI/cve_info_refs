- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM Spectrum Protect Client and IBM Spectrum Protect for Virtual Environments allow the use of legacy SSL/TLS protocols and ciphers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms due to the allowance of legacy SSL/TLS protocols and ciphers.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Potential compromise of the confidentiality and integrity of communications due to the use of weaker cryptographic algorithms.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks where an attacker intercepts communications and exploits the weak cryptography.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Ability to intercept network traffic between the vulnerable client/virtual environment and the server.
