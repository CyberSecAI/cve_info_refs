Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue found in the Installation Verification Tool (IVT) of IBM WebSphere Application Server. The vulnerability resides within the "ivtApp" application, which is used by the IVT.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists within the Installation Verification Tool
- The vulnerability is present in the "ivtApp" application, which is used to verify successful product installation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The document does not explicitly detail the impact of a successful XSS exploit, however, XSS vulnerabilities typically allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into a webpage viewed by other users. This could lead to:
- Cookie theft
- Session hijacking
- Redirecting users to malicious websites
- Defacement of website content
- Phishing attacks

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves the IVT, which can be invoked manually through the "firststeps" console or the "ivt.bat/sh" script. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts via the "ivtApp" application's servlets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script through the "ivtApp" application servlets
- This might require the attacker to have access to the application or an ability to influence data presented to the IVT

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability affects WebSphere Application Server versions 9.0, 8.5, and 8.0.
- The fix involves updating the `ivtApp.ear` file and the standalone application profile template.
- Manual steps are required from an administrator/user to update existing profiles/server configurations after applying the interim fix/fix pack or they can choose to uninstall the ivtApp if it is not needed.
- The application can be uninstalled, updated, or reinstalled using the administrative console or the wsadmin tool.
