# Security Bulletin: Cross-site scripting vulnerability in Installation Verification Tool of WebSphere Application Server (CVE-2018-1643)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

There is a potential cross-site scripting vulnerability with the Installation Verification Tool of IBM WebSphere Application Server.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2018-1643](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1643)

## Affected Products and Versions

This vulnerability affects the following versions and releases of IBM WebSphere Application Server:

* Version 9.0
* Version 8.5
* Version 8.0

## Remediation/Fixes

On a standalone application server profile, the “ivtApp” application is used by the Installation Verification Tool (IVT). The IVT verifies that the installation of the product and the application server is successful. On a standalone application server, the IVT queries servlets from the “ivtApp” application.

The IVT is invoked manually by a user either through the firststeps console or through the ivt.bat/sh script.

For more information regarding the Installation Verification tool, see the knowledge center document  ["Using the installation verification tool"](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSAW57_9.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.installation.nd.doc/ae/tins_ivt.html)

The application is also available as an installable **E**nterprise **A**pplication a**R**chive (EAR) file which is located at <WAS\_HOME>/installableApps/ivtApp.ear.

The fix delivers updates to the ivtApp.ear under the *installableApps* directory as well as the standalone application profile template which is used for profile creation so that new profiles are deployed with the updated “ivtApp”.

However, it will require manual steps from an administrator/user to update a profile/server-configuration that has already had the ivtApp.ear deployed either from profile creation or by an administrator/user. This is due to the requirement of an administrator/user to administer changes to the profile/server-configuration.

If there is no need for the ivtApp then it may be simply uninstalled.

The recommended solution is to apply the interim fix, Fix Pack or PTF containing APAR PI98558 for each named product as soon as practical.

**NOTE:** Manual steps may need to be taken after applying the Interim Fix depending on your environment.  See below for the steps.

**For WebSphere Application Server traditional and WebSphere Application Server Hypervisor Edition:**

**For V9.0.0.0 through 9.0.0.8:**

· Upgrade to minimal fix pack levels as required by interim fix and then apply Interim Fix [PI98558](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=ibm10739417)

--OR--

· Apply Fix Pack 9.0.0.9 or later.

**For V8.5.0.0 through 8.5.5.13:**

· Upgrade to minimal fix pack levels as required by interim fix and then apply Interim Fix [PI98558](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=ibm10739417)

--OR--

· Apply Fix Pack 8.5.5.14 or later.

**For V8.0.0.0 through 8.0.0.15:**

· Upgrade to a minimal fix pack levels as required by interim fix and then apply Interim Fix [PI98558](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=ibm10739417)

*WebSphere Application Server V8 is no longer in full support; IBM recommends upgrading to a fixed, supported version/release/platform of the product.*

***MANUAL STEPS:***

If there is no need for the ivtApp then it may be simply uninstalled.

If there requires further need for the ivtApp then it should be updated or uninstalled and reinstalled with the updated ivtApp.ear from <WAS\_HOME>/installableApps/ivtApp.ear

If it is a standalone application server environment. Please administer your changes through the standalone application server(s).

If it is a Network Deployment environment. Please administer your changes through the deployment manager server(s).

Please review the notes at the end of this article before proceeding for more information.

**Using the administrative console through the browser**

* To uninstall the application if present, see “Uninstalling enterprise applications using the console”:  <https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/trun_app_uninst.html>
* To (re-)install the application, see “Installing enterprise application files with the console”:  <https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/trun_app_instwiz.html>
* To update the application if present, see “Updating enterprise applications with the console”:  <https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/trun_app_upgrade_console.html>

**Using the AdminApp command through the wsadmin tool**

* To uninstall the application if present, see  “Uninstalling enterprise applications using the wsadmin scripting tool”:  <https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSAW57_9.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/txml_uninstall.html>
* To install the application, see “Installing enterprise applications using wsadmin scripting”:  <https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEQTP_9.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.base.doc/ae/txml_callappinstall.html>
* To update the application if present, see “Updating installed applications using the wsadmin scripting tool”:  <https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSAW57_9.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/txml_updatingapp.html>

**Note:** When the ivtApp.ear is deployed as part of profile creation, the application is named “ivtApp”. If an administrator/user has deployed the application afterwards (i.e in a federated configuration) using the default application name, the application can be named “IVT Application”. Alternatively, an administrator/user could have deployed the application with an application name of their choice.

**Note:** When a standalone application server (e.g. AppSrv01) that was created with the “ivtApp” federates its’ node to a Deployment Manager, the configuration with the “ivtApp” is not migrated into the new federated configuration. However, the old configuration is saved and when the node is unfederated the original configuration is restored which *will* contain the “ivtApp” that was deployed from profile creation.
