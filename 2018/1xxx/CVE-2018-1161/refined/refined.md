- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the `nvwsworker.exe` process of Quest NetVault Backup. When parsing the boundary header of a multipart request, the process fails to properly validate the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a stack-based buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted multipart request with an overly long boundary header.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Remote attacker, no authentication is needed.
