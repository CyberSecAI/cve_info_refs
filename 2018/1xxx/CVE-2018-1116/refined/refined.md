Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of CVE-2018-1116:

**Summary:** CVE-2018-1116 describes an improper authorization vulnerability in Polkit that allows for privilege escalation, information disclosure, and denial of service.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the `polkit_backend_interactive_authority_check_authorization` function in `polkitd` not properly validating the client-provided UID in D-Bus calls like `CheckAuthorization` and `RegisterAuthenticationAgent`.  As part of CVE-2013-4288, D-Bus clients were allowed to submit the UID of the subject to avoid races. However, this implementation allows any client to submit an arbitrary UID.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The core issue is the lack of proper validation of the UID provided by the client. Polkit trusts the client-supplied UID without verifying its authenticity or legitimacy.
*   **Trusting Client-Supplied Data:** Polkit incorrectly trusts the UID provided by the D-Bus client, which is not necessarily the actual UID of the process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker could potentially escalate privileges by manipulating the authorization checks.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  An attacker can determine whether a victim currently has a temporary authorization to perform an operation and can learn about which operations requiring authorization the victim is attempting.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**
    *   An attacker could cause the registered authentication agent in a victim's session to pop up a dialog, disrupting the user's workflow.
    *   An attacker could prevent the victim's authentication agent from working correctly for a specific victim process.
    *   The vulnerability can cause PolicyKit to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **D-Bus Calls:** The attack vector involves sending specially crafted D-Bus calls to the Polkit daemon (`polkitd`). Specifically, the `CheckAuthorization` and `RegisterAuthenticationAgent` methods are vulnerable.
*   **UID Spoofing:** An attacker crafts a program to submit an arbitrary UID in the D-Bus calls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system to send D-Bus messages to the Polkit daemon.
*   **Ability to Send D-Bus Messages:** The attacker must be able to send D-Bus messages to the Polkit daemon.
*   **Knowledge of D-Bus API:** The attacker needs to know the correct method calls and parameters for the `CheckAuthorization` and `RegisterAuthenticationAgent` methods.

**Mitigation:**

The fix involves modifying Polkit to validate the client-provided UID.  The fix implemented in this commit  ([bc7ffad5364](/polkit/commit/?id=bc7ffad53643a9c80231fc41f5582d6a8931c32c)) introduces the internal `_polkit_unix_process_get_owner()` and obsoletes `polkit_unix_process_get_owner()` as a private `polkit_unix_process_get_racy_uid__()`. This function is used in `polkit_backend_session_monitor_get_user_for_subject()` to determine if the subject UID may be caller-chosen. Then, the permission checks fail on caller-chosen UIDs in cases where the subject and caller must be the same.

**Affected Software:**

*   policykit-1 versions before 0.115-r2 (Gentoo)
*   policykit-1 version 0.105-15~deb8u3 (Debian 8 "Jessie")
*   Ubuntu 12.04 ESM
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
