- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability allows a local user to overwrite arbitrary files owned by the DB2 instance owner.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** File overwrite vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local unprivileged user can overwrite arbitrary files owned by the DB2 instance owner, leading to potential data corruption, denial of service or other impacts.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system where vulnerable DB2 instance is running. The attacker does not require any special privileges.
