- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The embedded launch script in Spring Boot versions 1.5.9 and earlier is susceptible to a symlink attack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the way the launch script handles file operations, allowing a user with shell access to manipulate symlinks and overwrite files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can use the symlink vulnerability to overwrite and take ownership of any file on the system, gaining control of the affected system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is the embedded launch script included with Spring Boot when the application is installed as a systemd or init.d service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs shell access to the server and the "run_user" must have permissions to create symlinks and the application must be installed as a service using the vulnerable launch script.
