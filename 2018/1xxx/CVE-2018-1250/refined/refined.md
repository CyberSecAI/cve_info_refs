Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-1250:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper authorization checks in Dell EMC Unity and UnityVSA versions prior to 4.3.1.1525703027.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Authorization Bypass: The system fails to enforce role-based authorization controls when directly interacting with certain APIs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote, authenticated attacker can bypass role-based authorization.
- This allows the attacker to read files on the NAS server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is performed remotely over the network.
- The attacker interacts directly with specific APIs of the Unity OE.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to the system.
- The attacker must be able to send crafted API requests to the affected system.

**Summary**
The vulnerability allows an authenticated user to bypass role-based access controls by directly interacting with certain APIs, thus enabling unauthorized access to read files on the NAS server.
