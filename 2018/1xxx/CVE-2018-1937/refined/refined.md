- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Intra-service communications between IBM Cloud Private Identity and Access Management (IAM) service and Openshift use unencrypted HTTP.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Use of unencrypted HTTP for inter-service communication.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The vulnerability could allow unauthorized access to sensitive information transmitted between the IAM service and Openshift due to the lack of encryption. The provided information does not go into the specifics of the impact but does suggest the risk is related to data confidentiality.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks that intercept the unencrypted communication between IAM and Openshift.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to be positioned on the network where they can intercept the unencrypted HTTP traffic between the IBM Cloud Private IAM service and Openshift.
