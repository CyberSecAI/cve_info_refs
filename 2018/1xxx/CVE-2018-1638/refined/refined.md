- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM API Connect Developer Portal does not enforce Two-Factor Authentication (TFA) during user password resets, while it is enforced for all other login scenarios.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Weak two-factor authentication enforcement. Specifically, the failure to enforce TFA during password reset.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially bypass two-factor authentication by resetting a user's password, potentially leading to unauthorized access and modification of the user's account.
- **Attack vectors:** Network based, an attacker can initiate a password reset request and gain access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to reach the password reset functionality of the API Connect Developer Portal.
