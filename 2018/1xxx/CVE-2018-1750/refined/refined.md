Based on the provided document, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1750:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is an **Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource**. Specifically, the IBM Security Key Lifecycle Manager (SKLM) does not properly restrict access to application backups.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Permissions:** The vulnerability lies in the fact that on Windows systems, all user accounts with access to the system have read access to all application backups created in the SKLM\_DATA folder. This means any user on the system can potentially access sensitive data contained within these backups.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Data Exposure:** Exploitation leads to the exposure of sensitive data contained in the SKLM application backups. Unauthorized users could gain access to cryptographic keys, certificates, or other sensitive configuration data managed by SKLM.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** Exposed data could be used to compromise other systems or data, depending on the contents of the backup and the environment.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attack vector involves a malicious or unauthorized local user on a Windows system where SKLM is installed. No remote access is required for exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User Access:** The attacker must have an account on the Windows system where the vulnerable SKLM version is installed. They do not need any special administrative privileges to read the backup files, as the permissions are set incorrectly to allow all users read access.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in IBM Security Key Lifecycle Manager versions 2.6, 2.7 and 3.0.
- The provided document includes a workaround for Windows systems and a fix for Linux systems via a script.
- The issue highlights a critical failure in access control, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- The document also includes a list of acknowledgments, references to vulnerability scoring, and links to more IBM security resources.
