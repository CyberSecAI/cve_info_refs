### Security Bulletin

## Summary

IBM Security Key Lifecycle Manager specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors. In case of Windows operating system, all user accounts with access to the system will have read access to all the application backups created in the SKLM\_DATA folder.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2018-1750](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1750)

## Affected Products and Versions

IBM Security Key Lifecycle Manager: v3.0- 3.0.0.1

IBM Security Key Lifecycle Manager: v2.7- 2.7.0.4

IBM Security Key Lifecycle Manager: v2.6- 2.6.0.5

## Remediation/Fixes

| *Product* | *VRMF* | *Remediation/First Fix* |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IBM Security Key Lifecycle Manager | *3.0- 3.0.0.1* | [3.0.0-ISS-SKLM-FP0002](https://www-945.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/downloadFixes?parent=IBM%20Security&product=ibm/Tivoli/IBM+Tivoli+Key+Lifecycle+Manager&release=3.0.0&platform=Linux&function=fixId&fixids=3.0.0-ISS-SKLM-FP0002&includeRequisites=1&includeSupersedes=0&downloadMethod=http) |
