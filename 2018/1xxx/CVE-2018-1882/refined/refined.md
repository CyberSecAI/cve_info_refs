Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2018-1882:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the logging mechanism of IBM Spectrum Protect products. When tracing is enabled, the client trace file may inadvertently display passwords in plain text.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unencrypted storage of sensitive information (passwords) in trace files.
- Failure to sanitize or mask passwords before writing them to log files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized disclosure of passwords used by IBM Spectrum Protect.
- This could lead to unauthorized access to backed-up data, systems, or virtual environments.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker with access to the trace files (e.g., through compromised systems or unauthorized file access) could obtain the passwords in plain text.
- This access could be obtained through local system access or via network access if the files are shared.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs access to the trace files generated by the IBM Spectrum Protect client, which can be on the same system or on accessible network shares or storage.
- No specific level of access is needed other than the ability to read these files.
