# Security Bulletin: Vulnerabilities in GSKit affect IBM Spectrum Scale (CVE-2018-1431, CVE-2017-3736, CVE-2017-3732, CVE-2016-0705 )

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

Vulnerabilities in GSKit affect IBM Spectrum Scale where:

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2018-1431](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1431)

**DESCRIPTION:** A vulnerability in GSKit affects IBM Spectrum Scale that could allow a local attacker to obtain control of the Spectrum Scale daemon and to access and modify files in the Spectrum Scale file system, and possibly to obtain administrator privileges on the node.

CVSS Base Score: 7.4

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/139240> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2017-3736](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3736)

**DESCRIPTION:** OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a carry propagation flaw in the x86\_64 Montgomery squaring function bn\_sqrx8x\_internal(). An attacker with online access to an unpatched system could exploit this vulnerability to obtain information about the private key.

CVSS Base Score: 5.9

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/134397> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2017-3732](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3732)

**DESCRIPTION:** OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a carry propagating bug in the x86\_64 Montgomery squaring procedure. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain information about the private key.

CVSS Base Score: 5.3

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/121313> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2016-0705](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0705)

**DESCRIPTION:** OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a double-free error when parsing DSA private keys. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to corrupt memory and cause a denial of service.

CVSS Base Score: 3.7

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/111140> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)
