- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization in the IBM DOORS Next Generation (DNG/RRC) web UI. This allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web UI, potentially leading to credential disclosure within a trusted session. This could allow an attacker to alter the intended functionality of the application, gain access to sensitive information, or perform actions on behalf of a victim user.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the web UI of IBM DOORS Next Generation, where a malicious user injects JavaScript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a user able to embed JavaScript code into the application via the web UI. This is likely a user with some degree of authorization within the application. The user interface vulnerability exists in the context of a trusted session.
