Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of CVE-2018-1461:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue within the web UI of affected IBM products.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The web UI does not properly sanitize user inputs, allowing for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can embed malicious JavaScript code into the Web UI, potentially leading to:
  - Alteration of intended functionality of the UI
  - Disclosure of credentials within a trusted session

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web UI.
- An attacker can inject malicious Javascript code into input fields within the Web UI.
- A user must then interact with the malicious code, typically by accessing the page or resource containing the injected code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious code into input fields or other relevant areas of the web UI.
- The attacker would require a low privileged user to then interact with the manipulated page.

**Affected Products:**
- IBM SAN Volume Controller
- IBM Storwize V7000
- IBM Storwize V5000
- IBM Storwize V3700
- IBM Storwize V3500
- IBM FlashSystem V9000
- IBM Spectrum Virtualize Software
- IBM Spectrum Virtualize for Public Cloud
- IBM FlashSystem 840
- IBM FlashSystem 900
- IBM FlashSystem V840

**Affected Versions:**
- All products are affected when running supported versions 7.5 to 8.1
- FlashSystem 840 and 900 are affected in VRMFs prior to 1.3.0.10, 1.4.8.0, and 1.5.1.1
- FlashSystem V840 is affected in Storage Node VRMFs prior to 1.3.0.10, 1.4.8.0, 1.5.1.1 and controller node VRMFs prior to 7.7.1.9, 7.8.1.6 and 8.1.1.2.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is described as allowing users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI, potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.
- The vulnerability is fixed in the following versions or higher: 7.5.0.14, 7.7.1.9, 7.8.1.6, 8.1.1.2, 8.1.2.1 for SAN Volume Controller, Storwize, Spectrum Virtualize, and FlashSystem V9000.
- For FlashSystem 840/900 upgrades to 1.3.0.10, 1.4.8.0 or 1.5.1.1 should be considered.
- For FlashSystem V840 upgrades to 1.3.0.10, 1.4.8.0, 1.5.1.1 or controller node VRMFs of 7.7.1.9, 7.8.1.6 and 8.1.1.2 should be considered.
