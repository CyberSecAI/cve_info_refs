{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Spring Framework allows applications to expose STOMP over WebSocket endpoints with a simple, in-memory STOMP broker through the spring-messaging module. A malicious user can craft a message to the broker that can lead to a remote code execution attack.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of crafted STOMP messages"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote Code Execution (RCE)",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted STOMP messages sent to the in-memory broker via WebSocket endpoints."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send messages to the STOMP broker over a WebSocket connection.",
     "additional_information": "The vulnerability affects Spring Framework versions 5.0.x prior to 5.0.5 and 4.3.x prior to 4.3.16, and older unsupported versions. The use of authentication and authorization for messages, which Spring Security provides, limits exposure to this vulnerability to authorized users."
