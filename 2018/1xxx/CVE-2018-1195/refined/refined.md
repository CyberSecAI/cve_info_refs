The provided content contains information about CVE-2018-1195.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Cloud Controller API incorrectly accepts refresh tokens for authentication instead of access tokens.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The Cloud Controller API allows the use of refresh tokens for authentication where access tokens are expected.
- This bypasses the intended security mechanism where a refresh token would require an existing access token, client credentials, or be not revoked to obtain a new access token.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with a refresh token, which might otherwise be invalid, can authenticate to the Cloud Controller API.
- This could lead to unauthorized access and potentially allow further malicious actions on the Cloud Foundry environment.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs to possess a valid refresh token to exploit the vulnerability

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have acquired a refresh token through some means, and can exploit it if it is not revoked or does not lack necessary client credentials.
