Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2018-1216:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A hard-coded, undocumented default account ("smc") with a known password exists in the vApp Manager embedded in various Dell EMC products.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Hard-coded credentials:** The presence of a default account with a static password.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** Vulnerable web servlets are accessible using the hardcoded credentials, despite the user not being authorized to access the web interface.
- **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can bypass normal web interface login to obtain a valid session ID and perform other authenticated actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** A remote attacker with the knowledge of the hard-coded password can gain unauthorized access to the system.
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** When combined with the CVE-2018-1215 vulnerability, the attacker can use the obtained session ID to upload malicious files to arbitrary locations on the server, potentially leading to remote code execution.
- **Compromise of Affected Systems:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to compromise the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attack can be performed remotely.
- **Web Servlets:** Exploitation involves using vulnerable web servlets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Accessibility:** The attacker must have network access to the target system.
- **Knowledge of Default Credentials:** The attacker needs to know the username ("smc") and the hard-coded password.
- **Knowledge of Message Format:** The attacker needs to understand the message format required to interact with vulnerable servlets.

**Additional details:**
- This vulnerability exists in Dell EMC Unisphere for VMAX, Dell EMC Solutions Enabler, Dell EMC VASA Virtual Appliances, and Dell EMC VMAX Embedded Management (eManagement).
- The "smc" account cannot be used to log in through the web UI, but through specific servlets.
- The vulnerability can be chained with CVE-2018-1215, which allows arbitrary file upload after authentication, enabling attackers to upload malicious code such as JSP shells.
- The default "smc" account has been removed from fresh installs of the patched versions, but the servlets that used the account were removed in upgrades to prevent exploitation.
