- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM Security Key Lifecycle Manager uses weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of vulnerable cryptographic ciphers.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could decrypt highly sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: Network based (AV:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker does not require any privileges or user interaction (PR:N/UI:N).  The attack requires high complexity (AC:H).
