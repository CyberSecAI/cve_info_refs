- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Db2 binaries load shared libraries from an untrusted path.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability lies in the way Db2 loads shared libraries, specifically that it does not validate the path from which the libraries are loaded, allowing an attacker to load a malicious shared library.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A low privileged user can potentially gain root access by exploiting this vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited by placing a malicious shared library in a path that the Db2 binaries search.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to write to a location that Db2 searches when loading libraries. They need to be a low privileged user with write access.
