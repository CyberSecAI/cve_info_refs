| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1575866#c0)  Siddharth Sharma    2018-05-08 06:35:16 UTC  ``` Service ticket issued using cephx to authenticate with a ceph service like Mon, OSD are vulnerable to replay attack. Ticket is sent with a nonce from client to service, service responds back to client with a mutation of nonce. This lets client verify that the service is what it says it is. Though this does not protect against a replay. If attacker is able to capture/sniff the exchange, attacker can replay the capture to authenticate with ceph service and perform actions only provided by the ceph service.  There are no known exploits against this, attacker has to be on the same network as of ceph cluster to be able to capture exchange.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1575866#c6)  Siddharth Sharma    2018-07-09 17:00:07 UTC  ``` upstream fix:  <http://tracker.ceph.com/issues/24836> <https://github.com/ceph/ceph/commit/5ead97120e07054d80623dada90a5cc764c28468>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1575866#c8)  Siddharth Sharma    2018-07-09 17:08:37 UTC  ``` Created ceph tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1599406](show_bug.cgi?id=1599406 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-1128 ceph: cephx protocol is vulnerable to replay attack [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1575866#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-07-11 18:10:53 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ceph Storage 3.0 for Ubuntu 16.04  Via RHSA-2018:2177 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2177](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2177)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1575866#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-07-11 18:21:09 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ceph Storage 3 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2018:2179 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2179](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2179)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1575866#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-07-26 15:36:03 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ceph Storage 2.5 for Ubuntu 16.04.

Package        : ceph
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-7519 CVE-2018-1086 CVE-2018-1128 CVE-2018-1129

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Ceph, a distributed storage
and file system: The cephx authentication protocol was suspectible to
replay attacks and calculated signatures incorrectly, "ceph mon" did not
validate capabilities for pool operations (resulting in potential
corruption or deletion of snapshot images) and a format string
vulnerability in libradosstriper could result in denial of service.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 10.2.11-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ceph packages.

For the detailed security status of ceph please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ceph>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1593308#c0)  Siddharth Sharma    2018-06-20 14:08:08 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the way ceph mon handles user requests. Any authenticated ceph user having read access to ceph can delete, and corrupt snapshot images.   This would require user to have read access and for that user must have key for authentication. It would only affect snapshots and images. So attacker with read access will only be able to corrupt data of snapshot images and rest of the ceph cluster should work as it is. Affect on integrity would be low and availability part can be controlled by mitigation using 'mon_allow_pool_delete = false' in ceph.conf to disable deletion of pools   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1593308#c1)  Siddharth Sharma    2018-06-20 14:08:11 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Use  mon_allow_pool_delete = false in ceph.conf to disable deletion of pools   ~]$ for p in `rados lspools` do    ceph osd pool set $p nodelete true done  caveat: This mitigation does not protect against  attacker from corrupting snapshot images   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1593308#c5)  Siddharth Sharma    2018-07-09 16:57:12 UTC  ``` upstream fix:  <http://tracker.ceph.com/issues/24838> <https://github.com/ceph/ceph/commit/975528f632f73fbffa3f1fee304e3bbe3296cffc>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1593308#c7)  Siddharth Sharma    2018-07-09 17:08:38 UTC  ``` Created ceph tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1599407](show_bug.cgi?id=1599407 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-10861 ceph: ceph-mon does not perform authorization on OSD pool ops [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1593308#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-07-11 18:10:54 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ceph Storage 3.0 for Ubuntu 16.04  Via RHSA-2018:2177 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2177](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2177)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1593308#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-07-11 18:21:25 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ceph Storage 3 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2018:2179 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2179](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2179)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1593308#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-07-26 15:36:03 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 for Ubuntu 16.04  Via RHSA-2018:2274 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2274](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2274)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1593308#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-07-26 18:06:28 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2018:2261 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2261](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2261)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1593308#c14)  Tomas Hoger    2020-11-11 09:58:33 UTC  ``` Fixed upstream in versions: 10.2.11, 12.2.6, and 13.2.1  <https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/releases/jewel/#v10-2-11-jewel> <https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/releases/luminous/#v12-2-6-luminous> <https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/releases/mimic/#v13-2-1-mimic>   ``` |  |

**Description**

The signature check code was validating only the first (32-byte) of two blocks, and thus did not cover all of the crc fields (notably not data\_crc).

## Synopsis

Moderate: Red Hat Ceph Storage 3.0 security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A2177)

## Topic

An update for ceph is now available for Red Hat Ceph Storage 3.0 for Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Ceph Storage is a scalable, open, software-defined storage platform
that combines the most stable version of the Ceph storage system with a
Ceph management platform, deployment utilities, and support services.

Security Fix(es):

* ceph: cephx protocol is vulnerable to replay attack (CVE-2018-1128)
* ceph: cephx uses weak signatures (CVE-2018-1129)
* ceph: ceph-mon does not perform authorization on OSD pool ops (CVE-2018-10861)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Bug Fix(es):

* Previously, Ceph RADOS Gateway (RGW) instances in zones configured for multi-site replication would crash if configured to disable sync ("rgw\_run\_sync\_thread = false"). Therefor, multi-site replication environments could not start dedicated non-replication RGW instances. With this update, the "rgw\_run\_sync\_thread" option can be used to configure RGW instances that will not participate in replication even if their zone is replicated. (BZ#1552202)
* Previously, when increasing "max\_mds" from "1" to "2", if the Metadata Server (MDS) daemon was in the starting/resolve state for a long period of time, then restarting the MDS daemon lead to assert. This caused the Ceph File System (CephFS) to be in degraded state. With this update, increasing "max\_mds" no longer causes CephFS to be in degraded state. (BZ#1566016)
* Previously, the transition to containerized Ceph left some "ceph-disk" unit files. The files were harmless, but appeared as failing. With this update, executing the "switch-from-non-containerized-to-containerized-ceph-daemons.yml" playbook disables the "ceph-disk" unit files too. (BZ#1577846)
* Previously, the "entries\_behind\_master" metric output from the "rbd mirror image status" CLI tool did not always reduce to zero under synthetic workloads. This could cause a false alarm that there is an issue with RBD mirroring replications. With this update, the metric is now updated periodically without the need for an explicit I/O flush in the workload. (BZ#1578509)
* Previously, when using the "pool create" command with "expected\_num\_objects", placement group (PG) directories were not pre-created at pool creation time as expected, resulting in performance drops when filestore splitting occurred. With this update, the "expected\_num\_objects" parameter is now passed through to filestore correctly, and PG directories for the expected number of objects are pre-created at pool creation time. (BZ#1579039)
* Previously, internal RADOS Gateway (RGW) multi-site sync logic behaved incorrectly when attempting to sync containers with S3 object versioning enabled. Objects in versioning-enabled containers would fail to sync in some scenarios—for example, when using "s3cmd sync" to mirror a filesystem directory. With this update, RGW multi-site replication logic has been corrected for the known failure cases. (BZ#1580497)
* When restarting OSD daemons, the "ceph-ansible" restart script goes through all the daemons by listing the units with systemctl list-units. Under certain circumstances, the output of the command contains extra spaces, which caused parsing and restart to fail. With this update, the underlying code has been changed to handle the extra space.
* Previously, the Ceph RADOS Gateway (RGW) server treated negative byte-range object requests ("bytes=0--1") as invalid. Applications that expect the AWS behavior for negative or other invalid range requests saw unexpected errors and could fail. With this update, a new option "rgw\_ignore\_get\_invalid\_range" has been added to RGW. When "rgw\_ignore\_get\_invalid\_range" is set to "true", the RGW behavior for invalid range requests is backwards compatible with AWS.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1576057#c0)  Siddharth Sharma    2018-05-08 16:56:30 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the way signature calculation is handled by cephx protocol. The signature calculation is encrypting a 29 byte struct with 16-byte block AES cipher, and then using the first 8 bytes of the result as signature. This only covers first (16 by tes) cipher block, data_crc falls on second block.There are no known exploits against this, If attacker can alter the message payload any changes in data_crc will not be noticed or checked by signature check.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1576057#c3)  Siddharth Sharma    2018-07-09 17:02:22 UTC  ``` upstream fix:  <http://tracker.ceph.com/issues/24837> <https://github.com/ceph/ceph/commit/8f396cf35a3826044b089141667a196454c0a587>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1576057#c5)  Siddharth Sharma    2018-07-09 17:08:54 UTC  ``` Created ceph tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1599408](show_bug.cgi?id=1599408 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-1129 ceph: cephx uses weak signatures [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1576057#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-07-11 18:10:54 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ceph Storage 3.0 for Ubuntu 16.04  Via RHSA-2018:2177 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2177](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2177)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1576057#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-07-11 18:21:11 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ceph Storage 3 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2018:2179 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2179](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2179)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1576057#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-07-26 15:36:03 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 for Ubuntu 16.04  Via RHSA-2018:2274 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2274](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2274)   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1576057#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-07-26 18:06:27 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2018:2261 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2261](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2261)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1576057#c13)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-07-24 09:06:58 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

## Topic

An update for ceph is now available for Red Hat Ceph Storage 2.5 for Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact
of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from
the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Ceph Storage is a scalable, open, software-defined storage platform
that combines the most stable version of the Ceph storage system with a
Ceph management platform, deployment utilities, and support services.

Security Fix(es):

* ceph: cephx protocol is vulnerable to replay attack (CVE-2018-1128)
* ceph: cephx uses weak signatures (CVE-2018-1129)
* ceph: ceph-mon does not perform authorization on OSD pool ops (CVE-2018-10861)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS
score and other related information refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the Reference section.

Enhancement(s):

* Ceph OSDs now logs when they shutdown due to disk operations timing out by default. (BZ#1568897)
* The `radosgw-admin orphans find` command can inadvertently remove data objects still in use, if followed by another operation, such as, a `rados rm` command. Users are now warned before attempting to produce lists of potentially orphaned objects. (BZ#1573656)
* The 'ceph-osdomap-tool' now has a 'compact' command to perform offline compaction on an OSD's 'omap' directory. (BZ#1574231)
* For S3 and Swift protocols, an option to list buckets/containers in natural (partial) order has been added. Listing containers in sorted order is canonical in both protocols, but is costly, and not required by some client applications. The performance and workload cost of S3 and Swift bucket/container listings is reduced for sharded buckets/containers when the `allow\_unordered` extension is used. (BZ#1595374)
* An asynchronous mechanism for executing the Ceph Object Gateway garbage collection using the `librados` APIs has been introduced. The original garbage collection mechanism serialized all processing, and lagged behind applications in specific workloads. Garbage collection performance has been significantly improved, and can be tuned to specific site requirements. (BZ#1595383)

Bug Fix(es):

These updated ceph packages include numerous bug fixes. Space precludes
documenting all of these changes in this advisory. Users are directed to the Red Hat Ceph Storage 2.5 Release Notes for information on the most significant bug fixes for this release:

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

# RHSA-2018:2274 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: Red Hat Ceph Storage 2.5 security, enhancement, and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

An update for ceph is now available for Red Hat Ceph Storage 2.5 for Ubuntu 16.04.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Ceph Storage is a scalable, open, software-defined storage platform
that combines the most stable version of the Ceph storage system with a
Ceph management platform, deployment utilities, and support services.

Security Fix(es):

* ceph: cephx protocol is vulnerable to replay attack (CVE-2018-1128)
* ceph: cephx uses weak signatures (CVE-2018-1129)
* ceph: ceph-mon does not perform authorization on OSD pool ops (CVE-2018-10861)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS
score and other related information refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the
Reference section.

Enhancement(s):

* Ceph OSDs now log when they shutdown due to disk operations timing out by

default. (BZ#1568897)

* The `radosgw-admin orphans find` command can inadvertently remove data objects still in use, if followed by another operation, such as, a `rados rm` command. Users are now warned before attempting to produce lists of potentially orphaned objects. (BZ#1573656)
* The 'ceph-osdomap-tool' now has a 'compact' command to perform offline

compaction on an OSD's 'omap' directory. (BZ#1574231)

* For S3 and Swift protocols, an option to list buckets/containers in natural (partial) order has been added. Listing containers in sorted order is canonical in both protocols, but is costly, and not required by some client applications. The performance and workload cost of S3 and Swift bucket/container listings is reduced for sharded buckets/containers when the `allow\_unordered` extension is used. (BZ#1595374)
* An asynchronous mechanism for executing the Ceph Object Gateway garbage collection using the `librados` APIs has been introduced. The original garbage collection mechanism serialized all processing, and lagged behind applications in specific workloads. Garbage collection performance has been significantly improved, and can be tuned to specific site requirements. (BZ#1595383)

Bug Fix(es):

These updated Ceph packages include numerous bug fixes. Space precludes documenting all of these changes in this advisory. Users are directed to the Red Hat Ceph Storage 2.5 Release Notes for information on the most significant bug fixes for this release:

Debian Bug     : 890034 896911 907581 915229 915231

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2017-18249

    A race condition was discovered in the disk space allocator of
    F2FS. A user with access to an F2FS volume could use this to cause
    a denial of service or other security impact.

CVE-2018-1128, CVE-2018-1129

    The cephx authentication protocol used by Ceph was susceptible to
    replay attacks, and calculated signatures incorrectly. These
    vulnerabilities in the server required changes to authentication
    that are incompatible with existing clients. The kernel's client
    code has now been updated to be compatible with the fixed server.

CVE-2018-3639 (SSB)

    Multiple researchers have discovered that Speculative Store Bypass
    (SSB), a feature implemented in many processors, could be used to
    read sensitive information from another context. In particular,
    code in a software sandbox may be able to read sensitive
    information from outside the sandbox. This issue is also known as
    Spectre variant 4.

    This update adds a further mitigation for this issue in the eBPF
    (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) implementation.

CVE-2018-5391 (FragmentSmack)

    Juha-Matti Tilli discovered a flaw in the way the Linux kernel
    handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote
    attacker can take advantage of this flaw to trigger time and
    calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithms by sending
    specially crafted packets, leading to remote denial of service.

    This was previously mitigated by reducing the default limits on
    memory usage for incomplete fragmented packets. This update
    replaces that mitigation with a more complete fix.

CVE-2018-5848

    The wil6210 wifi driver did not properly validate lengths in scan
    and connection requests, leading to a possible buffer overflow.
    On systems using this driver, a local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability could use this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or potentially for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-12896, CVE-2018-13053

    Team OWL337 reported possible integer overflows in the POSIX
    timer implementation. These might have some security impact.

CVE-2018-13096, CVE-2018-13097, CVE-2018-13100, CVE-2018-14614,
CVE-2018-14616

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported that crafted F2FS volumes
    could trigger a crash (BUG, Oops, or division by zero) and/or
    out-of-bounds memory access. An attacker able to mount such a
    volume could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-13406

    Dr Silvio Cesare of InfoSect reported a potential integer overflow
    in the uvesafb driver. A user with permission to access such a
    device might be able to use this for denial of service or
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-14610, CVE-2018-14611, CVE-2018-14612, CVE-2018-14613

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported that crafted Btrfs volumes
    could trigger a crash (Oops) and/or out-of-bounds memory access.
    An attacker able to mount such a volume could use this to cause a
    denial of service or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-15471 ((XSA-270)

    Felix Wilhelm of Google Project Zero discovered a flaw in the hash
    handling of the xen-netback Linux kernel module. A malicious or
    buggy frontend may cause the (usually privileged) backend to make
    out of bounds memory accesses, potentially resulting in privilege
    escalation, denial of service, or information leaks.

    <https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-270.html>

CVE-2018-16862

    Vasily Averin and Pavel Tikhomirov from Virtuozzo Kernel Team
    discovered that the cleancache memory management feature did not
    invalidate cached data for deleted files. On Xen guests using the
    tmem driver, local users could potentially read data from other
    users' deleted files if they were able to create new files on the
    same volume.

CVE-2018-17972

    Jann Horn reported that the /proc/*/stack files in procfs leaked
    sensitive data from the kernel. These files are now only readable
    by users with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (usually only root)

CVE-2018-18281

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the virtual memory manager
    that can result in a process briefly having access to memory after
    it is freed and reallocated. A local user could possibly exploit
    this for denial of service (memory corruption) or for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2018-18690

    Kanda Motohiro reported that XFS did not correctly handle some
    xattr (extended attribute) writes that require changing the disk
    format of the xattr. A user with access to an XFS volume could use
    this for denial of service.

CVE-2018-18710

    It was discovered that the cdrom driver does not correctly
    validate the parameter to the CDROM_SELECT_DISC ioctl. A user with
    access to a cdrom device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-19407

    Wei Wu reported a potential crash (Oops) in the KVM implementation
    for x86 processors. A user with access to /dev/kvm could use this
    for denial of service.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.144-3.1~deb8u1.  This version also includes fixes for Debian bugs
#890034, #896911, #907581, #915229, and #915231; and other fixes
included in upstream stable updates.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.9 packages.

RHSA-2018:2179 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2018-07-11
Updated:
2018-07-11
# RHSA-2018:2179 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: Red Hat Ceph Storage 3.0 security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

An update for ceph is now available for Red Hat Ceph Storage for Ubuntu 16.04.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Ceph Storage is a scalable, open, software-defined storage platform that combines the most stable version of the Ceph storage system with a Ceph management platform, deployment utilities, and support services.

Security Fix(es):

* ceph: cephx protocol is vulnerable to replay attack (CVE-2018-1128)
* ceph: cephx uses weak signatures (CVE-2018-1129)
* ceph: ceph-mon does not perform authorization on OSD pool ops (CVE-2018-10861)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Bug Fix(es):

* Previously, Ceph RADOS Gateway (RGW) instances in zones configured for multi-site replication would crash if configured to disable sync ("rgw\_run\_sync\_thread = false"). Therefor, multi-site replication environments could not start dedicated non-replication RGW instances. With this update, the "rgw\_run\_sync\_thread" option can be used to configure RGW instances that will not participate in replication even if their zone is replicated. (BZ#1552202)
* Previously, when increasing "max\_mds" from "1" to "2", if the Metadata Server (MDS) daemon was in the starting/resolve state for a long period of time, then restarting the MDS daemon lead to assert. This caused the Ceph File System (CephFS) to be in degraded state. With this update, increasing "max\_mds" no longer causes CephFS to be in degraded state. (BZ#1566016)
* Previously, the transition to containerized Ceph left some "ceph-disk" unit files. The files were harmless, but appeared as failing. With this update, executing the "switch-from-non-containerized-to-containerized-ceph-daemons.yml" playbook disables the "ceph-disk" unit files too. (BZ#1577846)
* Previously, the "entries\_behind\_master" metric output from the "rbd mirror image status" CLI tool did not always reduce to zero under synthetic workloads. This could cause a false alarm that there is an issue with RBD mirroring replications. With this update, the metric is now updated periodically without the need for an explicit I/O flush in the workload. (BZ#1578509)
* Previously, when using the "pool create" command with "expected\_num\_objects", placement group (PG) directories were not pre-created at pool creation time as expected, resulting in performance drops when filestore splitting occurred. With this update, the "expected\_num\_objects" parameter is now passed through to filestore correctly, and PG directories for the expected number of objects are pre-created at pool creation time. (BZ#1579039)
* Previously, internal RADOS Gateway (RGW) multi-site sync logic behaved incorrectly when attempting to sync containers with S3 object versioning enabled. Objects in versioning-enabled containers would fail to sync in some scenarios—for example, when using "s3cmd sync" to mirror a filesystem directory. With this update, RGW multi-site replication logic has been corrected for the known failure cases. (BZ#1580497)
* When restarting OSD daemons, the "ceph-ansible" restart script goes through all the daemons by listing the units with systemctl list-units. Under certain circumstances, the output of the command contains extra spaces, which caused parsing and restart to fail. With this update, the underlying code has been changed to handle the extra space.
* Previously, the Ceph RADOS Gateway (RGW) server treated negative byte-range object requests ("bytes=0--1") as invalid. Applications that expect the AWS behavior for negative or other invalid range requests saw unexpected errors and could fail. With this update, a new option "rgw\_ignore\_get\_invalid\_range" has been added to RGW. When "rgw\_ignore\_get\_invalid\_range" is set to "true", the RGW behavior for invalid range requests is backwards compatible with AWS.
