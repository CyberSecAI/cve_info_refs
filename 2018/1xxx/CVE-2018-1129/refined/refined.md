{
  "CVE-2018-1129": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the way signature calculation was handled by the cephx authentication protocol. An attacker having access to the ceph cluster network who is able to alter the message payload was able to bypass signature checks done by the cephx protocol. Ceph branches master, mimic, luminous and jewel are believed to be vulnerable.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The signature check code was validating only the first (32-byte) of two blocks, and thus did not cover all of the crc fields (notably not data_crc).",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper signature validation, allowing for message payload alteration without detection.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with network access to the Ceph cluster can bypass authentication, potentially performing unauthorized actions.",
    "Attack vectors": "Adjacent network access, requiring the attacker to be on the same network as the Ceph cluster.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be on the same network as the Ceph cluster and be able to alter the message payload."
