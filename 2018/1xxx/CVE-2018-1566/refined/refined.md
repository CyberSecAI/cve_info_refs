- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A format string vulnerability exists in the IBM Db2 tool `db2support`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Format string vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** If a customer's application or script with elevated privileges executes `db2support`, the vulnerability could lead to privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors:** Local users can exploit this vulnerability by calling `db2support` with a malicious format string. It cannot be exploited remotely.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to execute the vulnerable `db2support` tool, either directly or indirectly through a privileged process. The attacker does not need to have any privileges initially but can escalate them through the vulnerable application.
