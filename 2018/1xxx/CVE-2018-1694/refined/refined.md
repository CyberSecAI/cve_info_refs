- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) in IBM Rhapsody Model Manager.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of HSTS implementation which leads to an information disclosure vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information using man-in-the-middle techniques.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based, using a man-in-the-middle attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the client and the vulnerable server (man-in-the-middle).
