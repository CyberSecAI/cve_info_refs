Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The IBM MQ Console is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack due to the use of weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use of weak cryptographic algorithms

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful MITM attack could allow an attacker to intercept and potentially manipulate communications between the MQ console and its users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. The specific mechanism of exploitation (e.g., network sniffing, ARP poisoning) is not detailed in this bulletin, but the attacker must be positioned to intercept network traffic between the console and its users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be positioned on the network to intercept traffic between users and the IBM MQ Console. This typically involves being on the same network segment or controlling a router along the path.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
- IBM MQ V9.1 LTS: v9.1.0.0 - 9.1.0.1
- IBM MQ V9.1 CD: v9.1.1

**Remediation/Fixes:**
- **IBM MQ V9.1 LTS:** Apply FixPack 9.1.0.2
- **IBM MQ V9.1 CD:** Upgrade to v9.1.2

**Workarounds and Mitigations:**
- Enable FIPS mode in the jvm.options file for the MQ Console by adding the following line: `-Dcom.ibm.jsse2.usefipsprovider=true`
