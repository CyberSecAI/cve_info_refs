- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM Spectrum Protect for Enterprise Resource Planning, when tracing is enabled, may display the IBM Spectrum Protect node password in plain text in the trace file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Password disclosure due to logging the password in plain text in trace files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exposure of the IBM Spectrum Protect node password, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data breaches.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker who gains access to the trace files where the password is logged in plain text can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs access to the trace files generated by the IBM Spectrum Protect for Enterprise Resource Planning when tracing is enabled.
