- Root cause of vulnerability: The Light Installation Agent (LIA) in Dell EMC ScaleIO uses shell commands for certain actions, which are vulnerable to command injection.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Command injection vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: A remote attacker can execute arbitrary commands as root on the systems where the LIA is installed.
- Attack vectors: Remote network access to LIA.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: Attacker requires network access to LIA and knowledge of the LIA administrative password.
