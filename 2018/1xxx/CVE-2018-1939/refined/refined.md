Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is described as "attack from redirect calls", which suggests a vulnerability related to how the application handles redirects. More specific details about the redirect vulnerability are not available in this document.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The core weakness lies in the handling of redirect calls within IBM Cloud Private middleware. The document lacks specific technical details on the nature of this vulnerability, such as whether it's related to open redirects, path manipulation during redirects, or other redirect-related issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The document doesn't specify the exact impact of this vulnerability. However, redirect vulnerabilities can potentially be used for:
- **Phishing:** Redirecting users to malicious websites that impersonate legitimate sites.
- **Data Exfiltration:** Redirecting users to attacker-controlled sites to capture sensitive data.
- **Session Hijacking:** Manipulating redirects to gain unauthorized access to user sessions.
- **XSS attacks:** Using redirects to inject and execute malicious scripts in the user's browser.
 The specific impact will vary depending on the precise implementation of the vulnerability within IBM Cloud Private.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves manipulating redirect calls within the IBM Cloud Private middleware. This could involve crafting specific requests that lead to malicious redirects.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would likely need the ability to send HTTP requests to the affected IBM Cloud Private instance.
- The attacker does not necessarily need to be authenticated, depending on how the vulnerability is implemented. 

**Additional Notes**
- The provided information is limited, with the document lacking technical details about the vulnerability and its impact.
- The document refers to a patch for IBM Cloud Private 3.1.1, indicating that this version is the only affected version mentioned here.
- The vulnerability appears to be a server-side issue, as it involves redirect handling by the middleware.
