- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Intra-service communication to IBM Cloud Private Identity and Access Management (IAM) pdp service uses HTTP, which is unencrypted.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unencrypted communication channel.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Sensitive data transmitted between services could be intercepted if the network is compromised or monitored. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks (e.g., man-in-the-middle).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic within the cluster.
