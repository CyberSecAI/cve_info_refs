- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A potential spoofing attack exists in WebSphere Application Server when using Form Login with Java SE 6. This issue does not occur with other Java SE versions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a spoofing attack related to the Form Login mechanism within WebSphere Application Server when running with Java SE 6.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to spoof or impersonate a user.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the Form Login mechanism of WebSphere Application Server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to interact with the Form Login mechanism of the vulnerable WebSphere Application Server instance. The attacker must be able to manipulate this mechanism to achieve a spoofing attack.
