Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the CVE-2018-1821 vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the way IBM Operational Decision Manager (ODM) processes XML data. Specifically, it's vulnerable to XML External Entity Injection (XXE).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **XXE Vulnerability:** The application improperly handles XML data, allowing an attacker to inject malicious XML entities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** An attacker could potentially read sensitive files or data from the server.
- **Resource Consumption:** Exploitation can lead to memory resource consumption, potentially causing denial of service.
- **Port Scanning:** The exploit-db entry mentions port scanning capabilities as part of the exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:**  A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted XML payloads to the server.
- **XML Payload Injection:** The attacker injects malicious XML entities in the request sent to the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable IBM Operational Decision Manager instance.
- **Knowledge of API Endpoints:** The attacker needs to know the API endpoints that process XML data (e.g. `/res/api/v1/ruleapps`, `/rest/bpm/monitor/events`).
- **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP POST requests containing the malicious XML payload

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Products:** IBM Operational Decision Manager versions 8.6, 8.7, 8.8 and 8.9 are affected.
- **Mitigation:** IBM provided interim fixes for the affected versions, as well as a workaround for v8.6 and v8.7 that involves disabling XML validation in the HTDS application descriptor.
- **CVSS Score:** The base CVSS score is 7.1, with a vector of (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:L).
- **Exploit Example:** The exploit-db entry provides two proof-of-concept (PoC) examples demonstrating how to exploit the XXE vulnerability for port scanning and external DTD usage.

The provided information offers more detailed information than the official CVE description, particularly with the inclusion of PoC exploit examples and mitigation steps.
