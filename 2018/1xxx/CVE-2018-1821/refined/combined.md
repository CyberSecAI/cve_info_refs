# Security Bulletin: IBM Operational Decision Manager is affected by CVE-2018-1821 vulnerability

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

IBM Operational Decision Manager has addressed the vulnerability CVE-2018-1821

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2018-1821](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1821)

**DESCRIPTION:** IBM Operational Decision Manager is vulnerable to a XML External Entity Injection (XXE) attack when processing XML data. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to expose sensitive information or consume memory resources.

CVSS Base Score: 7.1

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/150170> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:L)

## Affected Products and Versions

* IBM Operational Decision Manager v8.6
* IBM Operational Decision Manager v8.7
* IBM Operational Decision Manager v8.8
* IBM Operational Decision Manager v8.9

## Remediation/Fixes

Select the following interim fix to upgrade your installation of ODM based on your version of the product:

Interim fix for APAR RS03231 and RS03192 is available from [IBM Fix Central](https://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/options?selectionBean.selectedTab=select&productGroup0=ibm/WebSphere):

IBM Operational Decision Manager v8.6: **8.6.0.3-WS-ODM\_DS-****IF035**

IBM Operational Decision Manager v8.7: **8.7.1.2-WS-ODM\_DS-****IF079**

IBM Operational Decision Manager v8.8: **8.8.1.3-WS-ODM\_DS-****IF090**

IBM Operational Decision Manager v8.9: **8.9.2.1-WS-ODM\_DS-****IF004**

For IBM WebSphere Operational Decision Management v7.1, v7.5, v8.0, v8.5 IBM recommends upgrading to a fixed supported version.

## Workarounds and Mitigations

For v8.6 and v8.7  a context parameter has been added to HTDS Application descriptor to prevent vulnerability in the validation feature with JDK 1.6:

Edit the web.xml  in the  HTDS WAR file to change the property ***DisableInsecureXMLValidation*** as needed

*<!-- Specify whether XML validation of requests is enabled for Java versions lower than 1.7.0

        Possible values are : true, false

        true : XML validation is disabled when Java version is before 1.7.0

        false : XML validation is enabled, for all Java versions

    -->

    <context-param>

        <param-name>DisableInsecureXMLValidation</param-name>

        <param-value>false</param-value>

    </context-param>*

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
