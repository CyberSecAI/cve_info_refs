- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `db2convert` tool.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: If a customer's application or script runs with elevated privileges and executes `db2convert`, the vulnerability may lead to privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors**: Local users can exploit this vulnerability by directly calling the `db2convert` tool if it is executed with elevated privileges. It cannot be exploited remotely.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a local user. They also need the ability to run a process with elevated privileges that calls the vulnerable `db2convert` tool.
