- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Malformed message headers in messages sent to IBM MQ RCVR or CLUSRCVR type channels.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of malformed message headers.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Channels go into retry status, blocking further message transmission, resulting in denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending messages with malformed headers to affected IBM MQ channels (RCVR or CLUSRCVR type channels).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Ability to send messages to the vulnerable IBM MQ channels.
