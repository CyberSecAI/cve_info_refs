    ],
    "vulnerabilityDetails": {
      "rootCause": "The Diagnostic Tooling Framework for Java (DTFJ) in IBM Java Runtime Environment does not properly handle path traversal when extracting compressed dump files.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Path traversal"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could overwrite or create files in arbitrary locations, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or other unauthorized actions.",
      "attackVectors": [
        "The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a compressed dump file containing malicious path traversal sequences."
      ],
      "attackerCapabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted compressed dump file that will be processed by the vulnerable Diagnostic Tooling Framework for Java.",
      "additionalNotes": "The vulnerability is present in IBM JDK versions 8 SR5 FP20, 7 R1 SR4 FP30, 7 SR10 FP30, and 6 SR16 FP70. The vulnerability is triggered when the DTFJ extracts compressed dump files without proper path validation."
