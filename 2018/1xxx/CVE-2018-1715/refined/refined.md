Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is the lack of input validation and sanitization in the IBM Maximo Asset Management Web UI. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can embed malicious JavaScript code within the Web UI. This can lead to:
    *   Altering the intended functionality of the application.
    *   Potential disclosure of user credentials within a trusted session.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the Web UI of IBM Maximo Asset Management. An attacker would need to inject the malicious JavaScript code through a vulnerable input field or parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs the ability to introduce malicious JavaScript code into an input field or parameter that is not properly sanitized by the Maximo application. A user with privileges to input data would likely be sufficient.
