| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1667204#c0)  Laura Pardo    2019-01-17 17:56:49 UTC  ``` Apache Thrift Java client library versions 0.5.0 through 0.11.0 can bypass SASL negotiation isComplete validation in the org.apache.thrift.transport.TSaslTransport class. An assert used to determine if the SASL handshake had successfully completed could be disabled in production settings making the validation incomplete.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

Package        : libthrift-java
Version        : 0.9.1-2+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-1320
Debian Bug     : 918736

It was discovered that it was possible to bypass SASL negotiation
isComplete validation in libthrift-java, Java language support for the
Apache Thrift software framework. An assert used to determine if the
SASL handshake had successfully completed could be disabled in
production settings making the validation incomplete.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
0.9.1-2+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libthrift-java packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1692345#c0)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2019-03-25 12:25:06 UTC  ``` In Apache Solr versions 5.0.0 to 5.5.5 and 6.0.0 to 6.6.5, the Config API allows to configure the JMX server via an HTTP POST request. By pointing it to a malicious RMI server, an attacker could take advantage of Solr's unsafe deserialization to trigger remote code execution on the Solr side.  Reference: <http://mail-archives.us.apache.org/mod_mbox/www-announce/201903.mbox/%3CCAECwjAV1buZwg%2BMcV9EAQ19MeAWztPVJYD4zGK8kQdADFYij1w%40mail.gmail.com%3E>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1692345#c1)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2019-03-25 12:25:38 UTC  ``` Created solr3 tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1692346](show_bug.cgi?id=1692346 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2019-0192 solr3: solr: remote code execution due to unsafe deserialization [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1692345#c5)  Jonathan Christison    2019-08-05 13:43:29 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  * Upgrade to 6.6.6 or later * Disable the ConifgAPI if not in use (`disable.configEdit=true`) * Use other external means to ensure only trusted traffic is allowed (block POST requests to the config API from external sources)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1692345#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-08-08 10:08:44 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Fuse 7.4.0  Via RHSA-2019:2413 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2413](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2413)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1692345#c7)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-08-08 13:18:37 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
