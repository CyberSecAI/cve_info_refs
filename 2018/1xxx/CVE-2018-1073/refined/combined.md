| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1557130#c0)  Sam Fowler    2018-03-16 04:42:33 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the implementation of transport.py in Paramiko before 1.17.6, 1.18.x before 1.18.5, 2.0.x before 2.0.8, 2.1.x before 2.1.5, 2.2.x before 2.2.3, 2.3.x before 2.3.2, and 2.4.x before 2.4.1 does not properly check whether authentication is completed before processing other requests, as demonstrated by channel-open. A customized SSH client can simply skip the authentication step.

Where paramiko is used only for its client-side functionality (e.g. `paramiko.SSHClient`), the vulnerability is not exposed and thus cannot be exploited.  The following Red Hat products use paramiko only in client-side mode. Server side functionality is not used.  * Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 * Red Hat CloudForms 4 * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 * Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization * Red Hat Gluster Storage 3 * Red Hat Openshift Container Platform * Red Hat Quick Cloud Installer * Red Hat Satellite 6 * Red Hat Storage Console 2 * Red Hat OpenStack Platform * Red Hat Update Infrastructure   ```  [Comment 57](show_bug.cgi?id=1557130#c57)  Yadnyawalk Tale    2020-04-21 09:51:07 UTC  ``` Satellite 6 before 6.3 was shipping paramiko for ansible and openshift-ansible.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A1525)

## Topic

An update for rhvm-appliance is now available for Red Hat Virtualization 4 for RHEL-7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The RHV-M Virtual Appliance automates the process of installing and configuring the Red Hat Virtualization Manager. The appliance is available to download as an OVA file from the Customer Portal.

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: rhvm-appliance (4.2). (BZ#1558801, BZ#1563545)

Security Fix(es):

* python-paramiko: Authentication bypass in transport.py (CVE-2018-7750)
* slf4j: Deserialisation vulnerability in EventData constructor can allow for arbitrary code execution (CVE-2018-8088)
* undertow: Client can use bogus uri in Digest authentication (CVE-2017-12196)
* jackson-databind: unsafe deserialization due to incomplete blacklist (incomplete fix for CVE-2017-7525 and CVE-2017-17485) (CVE-2018-5968)
* ovirt-engine: account enumeration through login to web console (CVE-2018-1073)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Chris McCown for reporting CVE-2018-8088. The CVE-2017-12196 issue was discovered by Jan Stourac (Red Hat).

Enhancement(s):

* Previously, the default memory allotment for the RHV-M Virtual Appliance was always large enough to include support for user additions.

In this release, the RHV-M Virtual Appliance includes a swap partition that enables the memory to be increased when required. (BZ#1422982)

* Previously, the partitioning scheme for the RHV-M Virtual Appliance included two primary partitions, "/" and swap.

In this release, the disk partitioning scheme has been modified to match the scheme specified by NIST. The updated disk partitions are as follows:

/boot 1G (primary)
/home 1G (lvm)
/tmp 2G (lvm)
/var 20G (lvm)
/var/log 10G (lvm)
/var/log/audit 1G (lvm)
swap 8G (lvm)
/ 6G (primary) (BZ#1463853)

* Previously, the version tag was used as part of the RPM's naming scheme, for example, "4.1.timestamp", which created differences between the upstream and downstream versioning schemes. In this release, the downstream versioning scheme is aligned with the upstream scheme and the timestamp has moved from the version tag to the release tag. (BZ#1464486)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:
