- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of HSTS implementation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can obtain sensitive information by exploiting man-in-the-middle techniques.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the client and the server. They also need to be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
