- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insecure file permissions on Windows platforms lead to password exposure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the way the software handles password storage, specifically using file permissions that are not secure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can gain access to stored passwords, potentially leading to unauthorized access to systems and data protected by IBM Spectrum Protect.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited through local access to the affected Windows system where IBM Spectrum Protect client is installed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access to the Windows system where the vulnerable software is installed and be able to access the files where the passwords are stored due to the insecure file permissions.
