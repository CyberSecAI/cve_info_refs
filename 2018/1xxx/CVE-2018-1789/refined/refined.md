- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by the application's failure to properly validate and sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to send a specially crafted request which the server processes and makes an outgoing request based on that input.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially use the server as a proxy to access internal resources or external services and potentially exfiltrate sensitive information or perform malicious actions by exploiting the vulnerability. The CVSS score indicates high confidentiality and integrity impact and low availability impact.

- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network based (AV:N) with low required privileges (PR:L) and no user interaction required (UI:N). An attacker can send a specially crafted request which the server processes and uses to make an outgoing request.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker requires the ability to send network requests to the vulnerable IBM API Connect server and have a valid user account. The attacker requires low privileges (PR:L) to initiate the attack, but can make the server make requests on behalf of the attacker to resources normally unavailable to the attacker.
