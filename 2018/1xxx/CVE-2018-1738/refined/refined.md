- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper authentication mechanisms.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of authentication within IBM Security Key Lifecycle Manager. This can allow an authenticated user to bypass security checks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an authenticated user to obtain highly sensitive information or jeopardize system integrity.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the application itself, likely by manipulating requests or exploiting flawed logic within the authentication process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application.
