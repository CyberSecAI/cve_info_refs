Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-1110:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Malformed DNS messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Knot Resolver handles malformed DNS messages. Specifically, the software doesn't correctly process or reject certain malformed messages, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): By sending carefully crafted malformed DNS messages, an attacker can cause the Knot Resolver to become unresponsive, effectively disrupting its ability to resolve DNS queries. This impacts system availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending malformed DNS messages to a Knot Resolver instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic, specifically DNS messages, to a vulnerable Knot Resolver instance.
- No specific position is mentioned, indicating a potential for remote exploitation as long as the attacker can reach the target resolver via the network.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in Knot Resolver version 2.3.0.
- The bug report indicates that the vulnerability was reported against version 2.3.0
- The provided bugzilla entry is a record of the CVE for tracking purposes within Red Hat's systems, not an initial vulnerability report.
