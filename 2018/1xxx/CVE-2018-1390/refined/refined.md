- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Duplicate Detect component in Financial Transaction Manager (FTM) for Check Services is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The bulletin does not explicitly detail the specific impact of successful XSS exploitation, but XSS vulnerabilities can allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, defacement, and other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is within the Duplicate Detect component of the FTM for Check Services application. The specific attack vector, such as which input fields are vulnerable, is not provided in the document but is implied to be through user-controlled data being improperly handled.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to be able to inject malicious scripts into the vulnerable component which would likely be through manipulating inputs to the application.
