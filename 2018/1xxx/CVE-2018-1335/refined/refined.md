  "CVE-2018-1335": {
    "description": "Apache Tika before version 1.18 has a command injection vulnerability in tika-server. A remote attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary commands via crafted headers.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the way the Tika server processes HTTP headers, specifically those starting with \"X-Tika-OCR\". These headers are used to set properties of the TesseractOCRConfig object. The values of these headers, such as `X-Tika-OCRTesseractPath`, are directly inserted into an array of strings used to construct an operating system command via `ProcessBuilder` without proper sanitization.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Command Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server running the vulnerable Apache Tika server.",
    "attack_vectors": {
      "network": "The attacker sends a crafted HTTP PUT request to the tika-server endpoint, including malicious headers, and an image file as payload to trigger the OCR process."
    },
    "attacker_capabilities": {
      "remote": "The attacker can be located anywhere on the network where the server is accessible. They must have the ability to send HTTP requests to the tika-server.",
	    "required_knowledge" : "The attacker must be aware of the vulnerability and the format of the crafted HTTP requests to exploit it. Additionally, a detailed understanding of how Java's ProcessBuilder interacts with operating system commands and how to chain commands on windows using cscript.exe is useful."
