- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper Access Control
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control allows unauthorized access or modification of resources
- **Impact of exploitation**: The impact is not explicitly stated but could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, configuration changes, or other malicious activities depending on the specific resources improperly controlled.
- **Attack vectors**: Not explicitly stated but would likely involve exploiting the access control flaw through network access to the IBM InfoSphere Governance Catalog.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker likely needs to have network access to the affected systems. Specific privileges are not explicitly stated, but the attacker needs to be in a position to exploit the improper access controls.
