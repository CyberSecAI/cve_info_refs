{
  "CVE-2018-1061": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a regular expression in the `difflib.IS_LINE_JUNK` method being susceptible to catastrophic backtracking.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Catastrophic backtracking in the regular expression within the `difflib.IS_LINE_JUNK` method."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service (DoS).",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is network-based; an attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a malicious input to servers using the affected Python code.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send input to servers using the vulnerable code, but no specific authentication or user interaction is required."
  },
  "CVE-2018-20852": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient domain validation in the `http.cookiejar.DefaultPolicy.domain_return_ok` method in Python.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "The method does not correctly validate the domain, which can lead to sending cookies to the wrong server."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker may trick a user's program into leaking cookies to an attacker-controlled server. Specifically, a server with a hostname that is a suffix of another valid hostname can potentially steal cookies intended for the latter.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is network based. An attacker must control a server with a hostname that has another valid hostname as a suffix.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control a server that has a hostname that is a suffix of the targeted domain and needs to entice a client to send a request to that attacker-controlled server."
  },
  "CVE-2018-20406": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by an integer overflow in the PyString_DecodeEscape function in stringobject.c which is mishandled during a 'resize to twice the size' attempt during serialization.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Integer Overflow: Mishandling of a large `LONG_BINPUT` value during resizing causes an integer overflow."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to memory exhaustion and a denial of service (DoS) if the pickle format is used for serializing large quantities of data (tens or hundreds of gigabytes).",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves crafting malicious pickle data with large `LONG_BINPUT` values, and then deserializing them, triggering the integer overflow.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to control or manipulate the pickle data that a vulnerable application deserializes. The data has to be tens or hundreds of gigabytes in size."
  },
    "CVE-2018-14647": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper initialization of Expat's hash salt in Python's `_elementtree.c` module.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Missing salt initialization in `_elementtree.c` leads to predictable hash collisions."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a denial of service by sending specially crafted XML data with pathological hash collisions, consuming excessive CPU and RAM.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to be able to provide carefully crafted XML data that when processed by the vulnerable Python code, leads to hash collisions.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted XML data to a system using the vulnerable python component."
  },
  "CVE-2018-1060": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a regular expression in the `pop3lib`'s `apop()` method being susceptible to catastrophic backtracking.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Catastrophic backtracking in the regular expression within the `pop3lib`'s `apop()` method."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service (DoS).",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is network-based, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a crafted response to the vulnerable code.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to control the response of a POP3 server. No authentication required by the attacker."
