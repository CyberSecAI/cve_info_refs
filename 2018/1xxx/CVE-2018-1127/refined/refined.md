    "weaknesses": [
      "Session tokens are not immediately invalidated upon user logout."
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers can hijack user sessions by replaying session tokens.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sniffing network traffic",
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks"
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "Ability to sniff network traffic or perform MITM attacks to capture session tokens before they expire.",
