{
  "CVE-2018-1124": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflows in the `file2strvec()` function of `libprocps`.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Multiple integer overflows leading to heap corruption.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Local privilege escalation or arbitrary code execution in proc utilities run by other users (e.g., pgrep, pkill, pidof, w), and also container breakout.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local attacker creating entries in /procfs by starting processes with very large command-line arguments or environment variables.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to start processes that can create entries in /procfs."
  },
  "CVE-2018-1126": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Incorrect integer size used in wrappers for standard C allocators.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Integer truncation, potentially leading to undersized memory regions.",
     "Impact of exploitation": "Could lead to heap overflow, but the primary vector for this vulnerability is CVE-2018-1124.",
    "Attack vectors": "A local attacker able to trigger memory allocations within affected procps utilities when large /proc/PID/cmdline or /proc/PID/environ data is present.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user with the ability to execute vulnerable procps utilities and trigger memory allocation within said utilities."
  },
   "CVE-2018-1123": {
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "Mmap-based buffer overflow of ps's output buffer `outbuf` in the functions `pr_args()`, `pr_comm()`, and `pr_fname()`.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The escape*() functions add the number of bytes written to `endp`, but never subtract from `OUTBUF_SIZE`. Multibyte character sequences in UTF-8 locale can cause a mismatch between 'bytes' and 'cells' written, leading to overflow of the output buffer.",
        "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service via a segmentation fault in `ps`.",
        "Attack vectors": "A local attacker, through environment variables of a process that can write a large number of bytes into a commandline or environ file in the `/proc` file system.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user with ability to execute ps with arbitrary env variables set."

  "CVE-2018-1122":{
        "Root cause of vulnerability":"Insecure loading of configuration files in `top` when the HOME environment variable is not set.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present":"Top reads configuration file from current working directory without any security checks when HOME env variable is unset or empty, and vulnerable to a function pointer hijack using crafted config file.",
        "Impact of exploitation":"Local privilege escalation via arbitrary command execution.",
        "Attack vectors": "A local attacker that can write to a directory where a root user executes top. By creating malicious configuration files, they can hijack the execution flow.",

        "Root cause of vulnerability": "Race condition in reading /proc/PID entries by procps-ng utilities.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present":"Utilities such as pgrep, pidof, pkill, ps, w read /proc/PID/cmdline. A race condition can cause a process to be hidden from procps utilities.",

        "Root cause of vulnerability": "read() access to /proc/PID/cmdline can be blocked by mapping a FUSE file onto the process's command line arguments.",
