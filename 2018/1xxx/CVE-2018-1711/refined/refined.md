- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Db2 Administrative Task Scheduler (ATS) is vulnerable because a user with appropriate authorization can modify the control tables used by the ATS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Privilege escalation. By modifying the ATS control tables, a user can gain unauthorized access to user data, including authorizations held by other users, RCAC row permissions, and column masks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized access to user data, including the ability to assume the authorizations of other users and bypass row and column access controls.
- **Attack vectors**: A user with the necessary authorization can directly modify the control tables used by the ATS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A user with sufficient authorization to modify the ATS control tables.
