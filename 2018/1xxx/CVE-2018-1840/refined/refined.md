Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-1840

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability arises during the migration of WebSphere Application Server from Version 8 to later versions (9.0 and 8.5). Specifically, it occurs when a security domain is configured to use a federated repository other than the global federated repository.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Privilege escalation is the core weakness. The configuration settings after migration are not handled correctly, which may allow a user with limited privileges to gain higher access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  A user could potentially gain elevated privileges within the WebSphere Application Server environment.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the migration process from WebSphere Application Server version 8 to versions 9.0 or 8.5. 
- It specifically affects configurations where a security domain is configured to use a federated repository other than the global one.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would likely need to have some level of access to the system, specifically the ability to interact with the WebSphere Application Server after a migration has been performed.
- They would not need to have any specific user privileges before exploitation, as the vulnerability allows to escalate to higher privileges.

**Summary:**
This vulnerability is specific to the migration process of IBM WebSphere Application Server. It occurs when custom federated repositories are used for security domains, potentially leading to privilege escalation after the migration from version 8 to versions 8.5 and 9.0. The fix is to either correct settings manually after migration or to re-migrate after applying an interim fix or a fix pack.
