  "CVE-2018-1057": {
    "description": "On a Samba 4 AD DC the LDAP server in all versions of Samba from 4.0.0 onwards incorrectly validates permissions to modify passwords over LDAP allowing authenticated users to change any other users passwords, including administrative users.",
    "affected_components": [
      "Samba LDAP server in AD DC configurations"
    ],
    "root_cause": "Incorrect validation of permissions to modify passwords over LDAP.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Incorrect permission validation in LDAP password modification"
    ],
    "impact": "Authenticated users can change the passwords of other users, including administrative accounts, potentially leading to complete compromise of the domain.",
     "attack_vector": "An authenticated attacker can leverage the LDAP protocol to modify other users' passwords.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must have valid authentication credentials to the Samba AD DC.",
    "additional_details": [
      "The vulnerability exists because of an extended object access right with the GUID ab721a53-1e2f-11d0-9819-00aa0040529b. By default, every user and computer object grants the change password right to self and everyone.",
      "The ACE granting the right to everyone (world, WD) must be removed as a mitigation.",
       "Workaround: Revoke the change passwords right for everyone from all user objects (including computers) in the directory.",
        "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 are not affected because they do not support the Active Directory Domain Controller (AD-DC) mode."
