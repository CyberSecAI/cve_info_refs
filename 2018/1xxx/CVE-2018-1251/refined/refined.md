Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1251:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a URL Redirection issue within the Dell EMC Unity and UnityVSA systems.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is the lack of proper validation or sanitization of URLs within the Unisphere interface, allowing for arbitrary URL redirection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit could lead to:
*   **Phishing:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites designed to steal credentials, including Unisphere user credentials.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Redirected users may unknowingly disclose sensitive information to malicious actors.
*   **Compromised User Accounts:**  If the user is tricked into providing credentials on a malicious site, the attacker gains access to the Unisphere system via stolen credentials.
*   **Loss of Availability:** By redirecting to malicious sites the attacker can deny access to the intended service.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based:
*   A remote unauthenticated attacker crafts a malicious Unisphere URL.
*   The attacker tricks a user into clicking on the crafted URL (e.g., through social engineering or phishing emails).
