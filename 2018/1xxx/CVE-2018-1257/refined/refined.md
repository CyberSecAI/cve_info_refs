Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described:

**CVE-2018-1257:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** A flaw exists in Spring Framework's spring-messaging module when it exposes STOMP over WebSocket endpoints with an in-memory broker. A crafted message to the broker can trigger a regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS) attack.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Improper handling of regular expressions within the STOMP message broker.
    *   Exposure of STOMP over WebSocket endpoints with a simple in-memory broker.

*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Denial-of-service (DoS) due to excessive resource consumption when the regular expression is processed.

*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   Crafting a malicious message to the STOMP broker via exposed WebSocket endpoints.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   Ability to send messages to an exposed STOMP over WebSocket endpoint.
    *   No authentication required, however, use of authentication can limit exposure.

**CVE-2018-1259:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** An XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability in Spring Data Commons arises from improper restriction of XML external entity references when using XMLBeam.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Lack of external entity restriction when binding request payloads to Java objects.
    *   Insecure usage of the XMLBeam library.

*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Remote attackers can access arbitrary files on the server by crafting a malicious XML request.

*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   Supplying specially crafted request parameters to trigger the vulnerable XML binding.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   Ability to send requests to an endpoint that processes XML using Spring Data's XMLBeam integration.
    *   No authentication required.

**CVE-2018-1260:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** A remote code execution vulnerability in the authorization process of Spring Security OAuth.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   A flaw in how authorization requests are processed.
    *   Remote code execution can occur when the resource owner is redirected to an approval endpoint.

*  **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Remote code execution on the server.

*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   Crafting a malicious authorization request to the authorization endpoint.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   Ability to send malicious authorization requests.

**CVE-2018-1257 (related to Enterprise Manager, Guest Access, and Retail applications):**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insecure use of Spring framework in multiple components.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Incorrect handling of framework components in several products.

*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   The impact varies depending on the specific product and component. In some cases, it leads to high impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   Exploitation via network protocols (typically HTTP) that are used to communicate with affected components.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   Ability to send network requests to vulnerable components.
    *  Authentication may not be required for some components.
