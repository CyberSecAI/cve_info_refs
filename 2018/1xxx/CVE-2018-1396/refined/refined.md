- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input validation, allowing users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code into the web UI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to alter the intended functionality of the web UI, potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could embed malicious JavaScript code into the web UI through user-controlled input.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a user of the application and be able to inject JavaScript code. User interaction is required, as the embedded script needs to be executed when a victim views the page containing the malicious script.
