## Workarounds and Mitigations

The fix removes DES-based ciphersuites from the set supported by default by the DataPower management interface.  To remove these ciphersuites manually, perform the following steps:

1. Create a new SSL server profile in default domain.
2. Remove the 5 3DES ciphers listed at the bottom of default cipher list (vis. ECDHE\_RSA\_WITH\_3DES\_EDE\_CBC\_SHA, ECDHE\_ECDSA\_WITH\_3DES\_EDE\_CBC\_SHA, DHE\_DSS\_WITH\_3DES\_EDE\_CBC\_SHA, DHE\_RSA\_WITH\_3DES\_EDE\_CBC\_SHA, RSA\_WITH\_3DES\_EDE\_CBC\_SHA).
3. Create new/assign existing identification credentials for this server profile.
4. Save the new SSL server profile.
5. While still in the default domain, navigate to Network->Management->Web Management Service.
6. In the Advanced tab, ensure Custom SSL server type is “Server Profile”.
7. Set custom SSL server profile property to the newly created SSL server profile in step #4.
