- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM DataPower Gateways use weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms. Specifically, the presence of DES-based ciphersuites in the default configuration of the DataPower management interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of weak cryptographic algorithms (DES-based ciphers).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially decrypt highly sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack on the DataPower management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept the network traffic related to the DataPower management interface. Requires a high degree of access complexity.

The document provides more detail than the official CVE description by listing the affected products and versions as well as remediation steps. It also identifies the specific weak ciphers used and provides mitigation steps for removal.
