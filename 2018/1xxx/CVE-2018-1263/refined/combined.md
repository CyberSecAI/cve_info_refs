# CVE-2018-1263: Unsafe Unzip with spring-integration-zip

CRITICAL | MAY 11, 2018 | CVE-2018-1263
# Description

spring-integration-zip , versions prior to 1.0.2, exposes an arbitrary file write vulnerability, that can be achieved using a specially crafted zip archive (affects other archives as well, bzip2, tar, xz, war, cpio, 7z), that holds path traversal filenames. So when the filename gets concatenated to the target extraction directory, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. The previous CVE-2018-1261 prevented the framework itself from writing the file. While the framework itself now does not write such files, it does present the errant path to the user application, which could inadvertently write the file using that path.

This specifically applies to the unzip transformer.

This can only happen if an application using this library accepts and unpacks zip files from untrusted sources.

# Affected Spring Products and Versions

* Spring Integration Zip Community Extension Project versions 1.0.1.RELEASE and earlier.

# Mitigation

Users of affected versions should apply the following mitigation:

* Upgrade to the 1.0.2.RELEASE

Or do not unzip untrusted zip files.

# Credit

This issue was identified and responsibly reported by the Snyk Security Research Team and Abago Forgans.
