- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `spring-integration-zip` library, prior to version 1.0.2, is vulnerable to arbitrary file writes due to unsafe handling of path traversal filenames within specially crafted zip archives. When a filename from the archive is concatenated with the target extraction directory, it can result in a file path outside of the intended destination.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Path traversal vulnerability: The library does not properly sanitize or validate filenames within zip archives, allowing attackers to create filenames that navigate outside of the intended extraction directory.
    - Unsafe file handling: While the framework itself no longer directly writes these files, it passes the unsanitized path to the user application which may then write the file to an arbitrary location.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially overwrite system files, place malicious executables, or gain unauthorized access through arbitrary file write capabilities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious zip archive with path traversal filenames.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious zip archive to an application using a vulnerable version of the `spring-integration-zip` library that unpacks it using the unzip transformer. The application must also write files based on the extracted file paths.
