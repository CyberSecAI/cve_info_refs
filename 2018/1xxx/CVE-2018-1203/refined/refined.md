Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2018-1203:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is an incorrect authorization vulnerability in Dell EMC Isilon OneFS where the `compadmin` user is able to execute the `tcpdump` binary with root privileges via `sudo`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269):** The `compadmin` user, who is intended to have limited privileges, is granted the ability to execute `tcpdump` with root privileges, bypassing intended access controls.
- **Incorrect Authorization:** The system incorrectly authorizes the `compadmin` user to execute commands with elevated (root) privileges, leading to a privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution as Root:** By leveraging the ability to run `tcpdump` with root privileges, an attacker (compadmin user) can execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the system. This is achieved by using the `-z` option of tcpdump which executes a script when rotating capture files
- **Complete System Compromise:** Successfully exploiting this vulnerability allows an attacker to gain complete control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Exploitation:** The attack is performed locally by an authenticated `compadmin` user who already has access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must have valid `compadmin` user credentials to log in to the system.
- The attacker must have local access to the affected Isilon OneFS system.
- The attacker needs to have a malicious script available on the file system that can be executed by tcpdump.

**Technical Details:**

- The provided exploit demonstrates how to create a shell script and then execute it as root by invoking tcpdump with the `-z` option and providing the shell script as the argument.

**CVSS v3 Base Score:**

- 6.7 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
