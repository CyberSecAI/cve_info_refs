- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing HSTS.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker could potentially obtain sensitive information by exploiting the lack of HSTS using man-in-the-middle techniques.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  A network position where they can intercept traffic between the client and the IBM API Connect server. This requires a high level of access complexity (AC:H), and the attacker does not need to have privileges, nor does the user need to do something.
