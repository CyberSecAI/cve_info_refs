- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing file checksums in IBM Multi-Cloud Data Encryption (MDE).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing checksum validation, which allows for data manipulation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthorized user could manipulate data due to the lack of checksums. The CVSS score indicates a low impact on integrity (I:L) with no impact on confidentiality (C:N) or availability (A:N).
- **Attack vectors:** Network (AV:N)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any privileges (PR:N), and there's no user interaction required (UI:N). The attack complexity is high (AC:H) which suggests that the attack is not trivial but possible.
