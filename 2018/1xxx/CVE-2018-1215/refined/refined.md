  "CVE-2018-1215": {
    "description": "An arbitrary file upload vulnerability was discovered in vApp Manager which is embedded in Dell EMC Unisphere for VMAX, Dell EMC Solutions Enabler, Dell EMC VASA Virtual Appliances, and Dell EMC VMAX Embedded Management (eManagement). A remote authenticated malicious user may potentially upload arbitrary maliciously crafted files in any location on the web server. By chaining this vulnerability with CVE-2018-1216, the attacker may use the default account to exploit this vulnerability.",
    "root_cause": "The vApp Manager does not properly restrict file uploads, allowing authenticated users to upload files to arbitrary locations on the web server.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Arbitrary file upload"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can upload arbitrary malicious files to the web server, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution and system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network access via vulnerable web servlets"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be authenticated to the application. This can be achieved by exploiting CVE-2018-1216 or other valid credentials."
  },
    "CVE-2018-1216": {
    "description": "A hard-coded password vulnerability was discovered in vApp Manager which is embedded in Dell EMC Unisphere for VMAX, Dell EMC Solutions Enabler, Dell EMC VASA Virtual Appliances, and Dell EMC VMAX Embedded Management (eManagement). They contain an undocumented default account (smc) with a hard-coded password that may be used with certain web servlets. A remote attacker with the knowledge of the hard-coded password and the message format may use vulnerable servlets to gain unauthorized access to the system. Note: This account cannot be used to log in via the web user interface.",
    "root_cause": "The vApp Manager contains a default account ('smc') with a hardcoded password that can be used to bypass authentication for certain web servlets.",
     "vulnerabilities": [
        "Hard-coded credentials", "Authentication Bypass"
      ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can use the hardcoded credentials to gain unauthorized access to the system and potentially chain with other vulnerabilities to achieve complete compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network access via vulnerable web servlets"
    ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to know the hardcoded password ('smc') and the message format to use the vulnerable servlets. This is readily available online as the hardcoded password was publicly disclosed"
