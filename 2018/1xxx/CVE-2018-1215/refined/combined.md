#### Description

A hard-coded password vulnerability was discovered in vApp Manager which is embedded in Dell EMC Unisphere for VMAX, Dell EMC Solutions Enabler, Dell EMC VASA Virtual Appliances, and Dell EMC VMAX Embedded Management (eManagement): Dell EMC Unisphere for VMAX Virtual Appliance versions prior to 8.4.0.18, Dell EMC Solutions Enabler Virtual Appliance versions prior to 8.4.0.21, Dell EMC VASA Virtual Appliance versions prior to 8.4.0.514, and Dell EMC VMAX Embedded Management (eManagement) versions prior to and including 1.4 (Enginuity Release 5977.1125.1125 and earlier). They contain an undocumented default account (smc) with a hard-coded password that may be used with certain web servlets. A remote attacker with the knowledge of the hard-coded password and the message format may use vulnerable servlets to gain unauthorized access to the system. Note: This account cannot be used to log in via the web user interface.

# [R2] EMC VASA Virtual Appliance Default Creds and Arbitrary File Upload

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

While researching [CVE-2017-4997](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-4997), Tenable discovered the default account "smc:smc" in the EMC VASA Virtual Appliance SE web application. We also quickly discovered that this account is not authorized to access the web interface:

```

2017-07-27 20:44:01,237 INFO  [em.bp.SECURITY] (default task-14) com.emc.em.common.security.authentication.Authenticator:User C:aceeca79-53d7-49ee-bfb8-0d425579597f\smc has successfully logged in
2017-07-27 20:44:01,344 INFO  [com.emc.se.utils] (default task-14) smc User Not Authorized

```

However, if you read the error log closely you'll see the initial login process was successful. An attacker can use this account to login and obtain a valid session ID:

```

[user@host inp]$ curl --tlsv1.2 -ki -d "user=smc&passwd=smc" "https://:5480/SE/app"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Expires: Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT
X-Powered-By: JSP/2.2
Set-Cookie: JSESSIONID=ubTvlGp-9jsCBy48a0GiQzW0Myly5BX9f2SaZoim.record; path=/SE; secure; HttpOnly
[...]

```

The session ID is the cookie's *JSESSIONID* without the *.hostname* string. In the above example the hostname was *record*. Therefore the session ID is *9jsCBy48a0GiQzW0Myly5BX9f2SaZoim*. With a valid session ID the attacker can perform many authenticated functions without interacting with the vApp Manager web interface.

Tenable further discovered that CVE-2017-4997 was not completely fixed. The "fix" did not stop authenticated users from uploading files to arbitrary locations. An attacker could login with the "smc" account and upload a JSP shell.

### Solution

Follow the upgrade advice provided by EMC's advisory.

message format may use vulnerable servlets to gain unauthorized access to the system.
Note: This account cannot be used to log in via the web user interface.
CVSSv3 Base Score: 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
