- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A vulnerability in IBM Spectrum Scale allows a local, unprivileged user to cause a kernel panic.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability can be triggered by accessing a file stored on a GPFS file system using `mmap`, or by executing a crafted file also stored on a GPFS file system.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to a kernel panic, effectively causing a denial-of-service on the node running GPFS.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local and requires an unprivileged user on a system with a mounted GPFS filesystem.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a local user on a system running the vulnerable IBM Spectrum Scale and must have access to the GPFS filesystem. The user does not require elevated privileges.
