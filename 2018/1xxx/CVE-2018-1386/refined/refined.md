- **Root cause of vulnerability:** SetGID and SetUID programs within IBM Workload Scheduler are compiled to search for libraries in the current directory, which is an insecure location.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure library loading. Programs with elevated privileges search for libraries in the current directory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain root privileges by placing a malicious library in the current working directory when a vulnerable program is executed.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploiting SetGID and SetUID programs. The attacker would need to place a malicious library in the current directory of the vulnerable program.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need the ability to place a malicious library in the current working directory of the process.
