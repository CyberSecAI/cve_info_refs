{
  "CVE-2018-1050": {
    "root_cause": "A null pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the printer server process of Samba when the RPC spoolss service is configured to be run as an external daemon.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Null pointer dereference",
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could exploit this to cause the printer spooler service to crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network access"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Authentication"
    ],
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered by a missing input sanitization check on some parameters to spoolss RPC calls. This can be mitigated by not setting the 'rpc_server:spoolss = external' parameter in the smb.conf file."
