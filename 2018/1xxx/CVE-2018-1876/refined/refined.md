- **Root cause of vulnerability:** IBM Robotic Process Automation with Automation Anywhere log files may contain plain text passwords in some cases.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Exposure of sensitive information (plain text passwords) in log files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized access to system passwords, potentially leading to further unauthorized access and actions.
- **Attack vectors:** Access to the log files, which could be gained through malicious insider activity, or by an attacker that has obtained access to the server/system the log files are stored on.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Access to the server/system where the IBM RPA software and related logs are stored.
