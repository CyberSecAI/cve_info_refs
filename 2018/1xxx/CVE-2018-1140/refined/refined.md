Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1140:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A missing input sanitization flaw in the LDB database layer, specifically related to handling the distinguishedName, within the Samba implementation used for the LDAP server. This lack of sanitization leads to a null pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient input validation on parameters passed to the LDB database layer, leading to a null pointer dereference.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) against the Samba server, specifically when it is configured as an Active Directory Domain Controller. The LDAP and DNS services crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack targeting the LDAP service of a Samba server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted LDAP requests to the vulnerable Samba server.
- The attacker needs to be in a position to send network traffic to the target Samba server.
- Authentication is not mentioned to be a prerequisite for the attack, suggesting that this may be possible without prior credentials.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Samba versions 4.8.0 onwards when used as an Active Directory Domain Controller.
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 are not affected because their Samba versions do not support the Active Directory Domain Controller configuration.
- Patches have been released by Samba upstream to address the issue, which involve input sanitization of the distinguishedName.
