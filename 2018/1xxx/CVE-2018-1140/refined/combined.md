Sidhpurwala    2018-05-21 04:18:04 UTC  ``` As per upstream advisory:  All versions of Samba from 4.8.0 onwards are vulnerable to a denial of service attack when Samba is an Active Directory Domain Controller.  Missing input sanitization checks on some of the input parameters to LDB database layer cause the LDAP server and DNS server to crash when following a NULL pointer.  There is no further vulnerability associated with this error, merely a denial of service.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1580230#c3)  Sam Fowler    2018-08-16 03:36:07 UTC  ``` External Reference:  <https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2018-1140.html> <https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=13374>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1580230#c4)  Huzaifa S.

# Samba: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **202003-52**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Samba, the worst of
which could lead to remote code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-fs/samba** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.11.6** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **4.9.18**revision >= **4.10.13**revision >= **4.11.6** |

### Background

Samba is a suite of SMB and CIFS client/server programs.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Samba. Please review

of Service condition, conduct a man-in-the-middle attack, or obtain
sensitive information.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Samba 4.9.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-fs/samba-4.9.18"

```

All Samba 4.10.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-fs/samba-4.10.13"

```
