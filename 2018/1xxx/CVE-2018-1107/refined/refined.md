Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1107:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) stemming from an inefficient regular expression used to validate email formats in the `is-my-json-valid` JavaScript library. The specific regex is `/^\S+@\S+$/`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inefficient Regular Expression:** The regex `/^\S+@\S+$/` is vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking when processing specially crafted input strings. The `\S+` (one or more non-whitespace characters) can match many different combinations when used with an invalid string.
- **ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service):** The inefficiency of the regex allows attackers to exploit the system by providing input strings that cause the regex engine to use an excessive amount of CPU and time during validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service condition by consuming excessive CPU resources and making the system unresponsive, or slow to respond.
- **Increased CPU Consumption**: The vulnerability results in an exponential increase in processing time as the input string size grows, leading to CPU exhaustion.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Input:** Attackers can submit specially crafted JSON data with invalid email fields designed to trigger the vulnerable regex.
- **Network Level:** This vulnerability is remotely exploitable, attackers could trigger this from network level.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Submit Input:** Attackers need to be able to submit data to the system that will be validated using the vulnerable `is-my-json-valid` library.
- **No Privileges Required**: The attacker does not require any prior access or privileges to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was present in `is-my-json-valid` versions before `1.4.1` and before `2.17.2`.
- Patches were released in versions `1.4.1` and `2.17.2` to address the issue.
- The vulnerability can cause a 10-second matching time for a 90K character long string.
- The issue was reported by Jamie Davis and fixed by the maintainers after the initial disclosure.
- Snyk has published an exploit code for this vulnerability.
- Red Hat also acknowledges this vulnerability and has issued a fix for the affected products.
