| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1564405#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2018-04-06 07:57:28 UTC  ```  Spring Framework allows applications to expose STOMP over WebSocket endpoints with a simple, in-memory STOMP broker through the spring-messaging module. A malicious user (or attacker) can craft a message to the broker that can lead to a remote code execution attack.  External References:  <https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2018-1270>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1564405#c1)  Andrej Nemec    2018-04-06 08:04:02 UTC  ``` Created springframework tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1564409](show_bug.cgi?id=1564409 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2018-1270 CVE-2018-1272 springframework: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1564405#c4)  Chess Hazlett    2018-04-10 17:16:27 UTC  ``` Upstream fix (5.0.5): <https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/e0de9126ed8cf25cf141d3e66420da94e350708a> The fix in 4.3.15 was incomplete, and a new CVE issued: [CVE-2018-1275](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1275).   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1564405#c9)  Chess Hazlett    2018-04-16 18:27:26 UTC  ``` Statement:  No Red Hat products are directly affected by this flaw; the products that package some parts of the Spring Framework either do not ship the affected messaging component, or use an older version that is not affected.   Fuse 6.3 and Fuse Integration Services 2.0 are both not directly affected by the flaw, but both point to the affected versions in their respective Camel-Springboot Maven repository BOMs. Fixes for those repository links will be addressed in advisories via regular patch cycle; customers using Spring stomp messaging from these Maven repositories are advised to update to the new BOMs when available.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1564405#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-10-17 19:29:15 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Fuse Intergration Services 2.0 based on Fuse 6.3 R8  Via RHSA-2018:2939 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2939](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2939)   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1571050#c0)  Sam Fowler    2018-04-24 02:38:14 UTC  ``` Spring Framework versions 5.0 to 5.0.4, 4.3 to 4.3.14, and older unsupported versions allow applications to configure Spring MVC to serve static resources (e.g. CSS, JS, images). When static resources are served from a file system on Windows (as opposed to the classpath, or the ServletContext), a malicious user can send a request using a specially crafted URL that can lead a directory traversal attack.  This vulnerability does not affect applications that use versions of Spring Security patched for [CVE-2018-1199](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1199).

# CVE-2018-1275: Address partial fix for CVE-2018-1270

CRITICAL | APRIL 09, 2018 | CVE-2018-1275
# Description

This CVE addresses the partial fix for [CVE-2018-1270](/security/cve-2018-1270) in the 4.3.x branch of the Spring Framework.

Spring Framework, versions 5.0.x prior to 5.0.5 and versions 4.3.x prior to 4.3.16, as well as older unsupported versions allow applications to expose STOMP over WebSocket endpoints with a simple, in-memory STOMP broker through the spring-messaging module. A malicious user (or attacker) can craft a message to the broker that can lead to a remote code execution attack.

# Affected Spring Products and Versions

* Spring Framework 5.0 to 5.0.4
* Spring Framework 4.3 to 4.3.15
* Older unsupported versions are also affected

# Mitigation

Users of affected versions should apply the following mitigation:

* 5.0.x users should upgrade to 5.0.5
* 4.3.x users should upgrade to 4.3.16
* Older versions should upgrade to a supported branch

There are no other mitigation steps necessary.

Note that the use of authentication and authorization for messages, both of which are provided by Spring Security, limits exposure to this vulnerability to authorized users.

# Credit

This original issue CVE-2018-1270 was identified and responsibly reported by Alvaro Muñoz (@pwntester), Micro Focus Fortify. The subsequent CVE-2018-1275 partial fix was identified and responsibly reported independently by rwx, Christoph Dreis, and 0c0c0f from 360观星实验室.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1564408#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2018-04-06 08:02:43 UTC  ```  Spring Framework provides client-side support for multipart requests. When Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux server application (server A) receives input from a remote client, and then uses that input to make a multipart request to another server (server B), it can be exposed to an attack, where an extra multipart is inserted in the content of the request from server A, causing server B to use the wrong value for a part it expects. This could to lead privilege escalation, for example, if the part content represents a username or user roles.  In order for the attacker to succeed, they would have to be able to guess the multipart boundary value chosen by server A for the multipart request to server B, which requires the attacker to also have control of the server or the ability to see the HTTP log of server A through a separate attack vector.
