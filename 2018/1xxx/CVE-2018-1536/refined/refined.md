- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization, which allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the web UI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to alter the intended functionality of the web UI, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information, such as credentials, within a trusted user session.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting arbitrary JavaScript code into the web UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to interact with the application's web UI, specifically being able to input data which is not properly sanitized. The attacker also needs a user to interact with the malicious JavaScript by loading the page or view where it was injected.
