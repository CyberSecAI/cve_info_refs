Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1304:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The provided content directly mentions CVE-2018-1304 in multiple sources, including NetApp, Red Hat, Debian, and Ubuntu advisories. The descriptions of the vulnerability consistently refer to the incorrect handling of an empty string URL pattern within security constraints in Apache Tomcat, which matches the official CVE description.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The core issue lies within Apache Tomcat's servlet container. Specifically, when a security constraint is defined using an empty string ("") as the URL pattern (which should map exactly to the context root), Tomcat fails to handle this correctly, causing the security constraint to be ignored.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Security Constraint Handling:** The primary vulnerability is the failure to apply security constraints when the URL pattern is an empty string. This means that resources that should be protected by those constraints are left exposed.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation allows unauthorized users to access web application resources that should be protected, potentially leading to unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information or unauthorized modification of data.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable through network requests targeting the context root of a web application with an empty string URL pattern.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without prior authentication.
*   **No special privileges** on the target system are required.
*   **No User Interaction:** The attack can be automated, requiring no specific action from a user.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple Apache Tomcat versions: 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.4, 8.5.0 to 8.5.27, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.49, and 7.0.0 to 7.0.84.
*   Various vendors, including NetApp, Red Hat, Debian, and Ubuntu, confirm that their products that include vulnerable Apache Tomcat versions are affected.
*   Red Hat specifically mentions this vulnerability in the context of JBoss EAP and Web Server.
*   Ubuntu notes that this issue affects Tomcat7 and Tomcat8 installations.
