Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities, focusing on CVE-2018-1186:

**CVE-2018-1186: Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability in Cluster Description**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation. Specifically, the "description" parameter of the `/cluster/identity` endpoint in the Dell EMC Isilon OneFS web administration interface is vulnerable to cross-site scripting.
*   **Weakness:** The web application fails to sanitize or properly encode user-supplied input when rendering the cluster description within the web interface. This allows a malicious administrator to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code.
*   **Impact:**
    *   A malicious administrator can inject malicious scripts into the cluster description.
    *   Every time another user opens the OneFS web console, the injected code will be executed in their browser session, within the context of the OneFS website.
    *   This can lead to actions being performed on behalf of the victim user or other malicious behavior.
    *   The impact of the attack can include information disclosure or manipulation, depending on the injected code.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker with administrative access can send a crafted HTTP PUT request to the `/platform/3/cluster/identity` endpoint, injecting malicious JavaScript into the `description` field of the JSON body.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have administrative privileges within the Dell EMC Isilon OneFS web interface. This means the attacker needs to be a "malicious administrator".

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information is more detailed than a typical CVE description, as it includes proof-of-concept code and specific HTTP request examples.
*   This vulnerability is classified as a persistent (stored) XSS vulnerability as the malicious code is stored and executed each time the user visits the web console.
