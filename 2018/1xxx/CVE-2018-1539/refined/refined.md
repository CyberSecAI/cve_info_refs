Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2018-1539:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the IBM Rational Engineering Lifecycle Manager (RELM) allowing remote attackers to bypass authentication. This can be achieved by sending a direct request or forcing browsing to a page other than the intended URL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Authentication bypass. The application fails to properly restrict access to specific pages, allowing unauthorized users to access them directly.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to certain pages/functionalities. The impact is rated as low for Confidentiality and Integrity, and no impact on Availability.

**Attack vectors:**
Remote attackers can exploit the vulnerability through direct requests or forced browsing.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the application server. The attacker needs to have some knowledge of the application's URL structure to be able to craft the requests. It appears the attacker needs to have some basic level of access (PR:L). User interaction is required (UI:R) to successfully exploit this vulnerability.
