Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1062:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the combination of "Enable Discard" and "Wipe After Delete" (WAD) flags for virtual machine (VM) disks in oVirt. When both flags are enabled for a VM disk, the discarded data might not be completely wiped after the disk is removed from a VM.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incomplete data wiping: When a disk is removed from a VM with both "Enable Discard" and WAD enabled, the storage blocks might not be fully zeroed out.
- Data leakage: If the same storage blocks are later allocated to a new disk attached to a different VM, sensitive data from the previous VM could be exposed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to sensitive data: A privileged user of a VM could potentially gain access to data from a previous VM if the storage blocks are reallocated without being properly wiped.
- Information disclosure: This could lead to the leakage of sensitive information between virtual machines.

**Attack vectors:**
- VM disk removal and reallocation: An attacker needs to be able to create, remove, and reallocate VM disks with the vulnerable settings enabled.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Privileged user: The attacker needs to be a privileged user within the oVirt environment, capable of managing VMs, disks, and storage.
- Knowledge of the vulnerability: The attacker needs to be aware of the specific vulnerability associated with the combination of "Enable Discard" and "Wipe After Delete".
- Ability to create and remove virtual disks: The attacker needs to have the capability to create and remove virtual machine disks.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was found in oVirt 4.1.
- The issue was addressed by disabling the simultaneous support for both "Wipe After Delete" and "Enable Discard".
- The fix was included in the RHBA-2018:0135 errata.
- The vulnerability was fixed in ovirt-engine 4.1.9.
