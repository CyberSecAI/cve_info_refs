| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1549944#c0)  Doran Moppert    2018-02-28 06:31:28 UTC  ``` In oVirt 4.1, the Enable Discard feature was introduced.  This was found to be unreliable in combination with Wipe After Delete (WAD), in that a VM Disk with both flags configured could be removed from a VM and not have all of its blocks wiped.  If the same storage pages were then assigned to another Virtual Machine, potentially sensitive data could be read from those pages instead of zeroes.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1549944#c1)  Doran Moppert    2018-02-28 06:31:34 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Idan Shaby (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1549944#c2)  Doran Moppert    2018-03-06 05:44:29 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/84875> <https://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/84861>   ``` |  |

## Synopsis

org.ovirt.engine-root bug fix and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Bug Fix Advisory

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHBA-2018%3A0135)

## Topic

An update for org.ovirt.engine-root is now available for Red Hat Virtualization Manager version 4.1.

## Description

The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager is a centralized management platform that allows system administrators to view and manage virtual machines. The Manager provides a comprehensive range of features including search capabilities, resource management, live migrations, and virtual infrastructure provisioning.

The Manager is a JBoss Application Server application that provides several interfaces through which the virtual environment can be accessed and interacted with, including an Administration Portal, a User Portal, and a Representational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API).

Changes to the ovirt-engine component:

* When live or cold merge fails, snapshot disks may be left in an illegal state. If virtual machines with illegal snapshot disks are shut down, they will not re-start. Virtual machines with illegal snapshot disks are now marked with an exclamation mark and a warning message not to shut them down. (BZ#1533061)
* The kernel no longer supports the /sys/block/dm-X/queue/discard\_zeroes\_data file in sysfs. It is therefore no longer possible to determine whether discarded blocks from a block device returns zeros or the actual data. Therefore, the virtual machine disk properties "Wipe After Delete" and "Enable Discard" are no longer supported at the same time. (BZ#1529305)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:
