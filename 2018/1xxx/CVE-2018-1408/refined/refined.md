- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in IBM Team Concert (RTC).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application fails to properly sanitize user input, allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript code within the Web UI.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code, which can lead to the alteration of the intended functionality of the web application. This may further lead to the disclosure of credentials within a trusted session, allowing an attacker to gain unauthorized access or privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered via user interaction with a web interface. A malicious user can inject JavaScript into a field in the RTC interface, and when another user views that field in the web UI, the malicious Javascript will execute.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a user with the ability to modify data within the RTC application. The attacker also relies on another user to view the malicious data in the web UI.
