```
[CVEID]:CVE-2018-1317
[PRODUCT]:Apache Zeppelin
[VERSION]:Apache Zeppelin prior to 0.8.0 (released July 2018)
[PROBLEMTYPE]:Improper Authentication
[DESCRIPTION]: In Apache Zeppelin prior to 0.8.0 the cron scheduler was enabled by default and could allow users to run paragraphs as other users without authentication.
```

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The cron scheduler was enabled by default and did not perform proper authentication checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Improper authentication, specifically within the cron scheduler.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Users could execute paragraphs as other users without needing to authenticate as that user. This could lead to unauthorized access to data or system resources.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs through the cron scheduler.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be a user of the Apache Zeppelin instance and must have the ability to schedule cron jobs.
