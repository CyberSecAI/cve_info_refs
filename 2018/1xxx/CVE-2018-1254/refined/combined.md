DSA-2018-107: RSA Authentication Manager Cross-site scripting Vulnerabilities

Dell EMC Identifier: DSA-2018-107

CVE Identifier: CVE-2018-1253, CVE-2018-1254
Severity: Medium
Severity Rating: CVSS v3 Base Score: See below for individual CVSS V3 Scores.
Affected Products:
RSA Authentication Manager versions prior to 8.3 P1
Summary:
RSA Authentication Manager contains fixes for cross-site scripting vulnerabilities that could potentially be exploited
by malicious users to compromise the affected system.
Details:
*             Stored cross-site scripting vulnerability (CVE-2018-1253)
RSA Authentication Manager Operation Console, versions 8.3 P1 and earlier, contains a stored cross-site scripting
vulnerability. A malicious Operations Console administrator could potentially exploit this vulnerability to store
arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code through the web interface. When other Operations Console administrators open the
affected page, the injected scripts could potentially be executed in their browser.
CVSSv3 Base Score: 6.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L)
*             Reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability (CVE-2018-1254)
RSA Authentication Manager Security Console, versions 8.3 P1 and earlier, contains a reflected cross-site scripting
vulnerability. A remote unauthenticated attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by tricking a victim
Security Console administrator to supply malicious HTML or JavaScript code to a vulnerable web application, which is
then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser.
CVSSv3 Base Score: 4.7 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)
Recommendation:
The following RSA Authentication Manager release contains resolutions to these vulnerabilities:
*             RSA Authentication Manager version 8.3 P1 and later
RSA recommends all customers upgrade at the earliest opportunity.
