- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow attackers to alter the intended functionality of the web UI, potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious JavaScript code through user-provided input into the web UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker must be able to inject JavaScript into the application via user-provided input.
