* [Section 4.1, iManager Workstation Does Not Work on SLED 12 SP3 and OpenSUSE 42.3](#b1693y3z)
* [Section 4.2, Base and Framework Content are Displayed After Upgrading to iManager 3.1](#b1749pra)

### 4.1 iManager Workstation Does Not Work on SLED 12 SP3 and OpenSUSE 42.3

*Issue:*
iManager Workstation does not work on SLED 12 SP3 and OpenSUSE 42.3 and above.

*Workaround:*
Launch iManager using the iManager.sh command and access the workstation through other browser using the URL: <http://localhost:48080/nps>.

### 4.2 Base and Framework Content are Displayed After Upgrading to iManager 3.1

*Issue:*
When iManager is upgraded to 3.1, iManager Base and Framework Content are displayed under the Available NetIQ Plug-in Modules list on Linux. On Windows, you will see only the iManager Base Content displayed under the Available NetIQ Plug-in Modules list.

*Woraround:*
It is safe to ignore and continue working on iManager because it does not affect the iManager functionality in any way. However, if you do not want the Base and Framework Content to display in the list, select iManager Base Content and iManager Framework Content, click Install, and then restart Tomcat.
