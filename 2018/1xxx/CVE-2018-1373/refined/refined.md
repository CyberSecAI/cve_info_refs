- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Inadequate account lockout setting.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The system uses an insufficient account lockout mechanism, making it vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can potentially brute-force account credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the affected service, and does not need any existing credentials.
