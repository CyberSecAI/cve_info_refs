Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2018-1451:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is not explicitly detailed, but the vulnerability allows for arbitrary file overwrites due to unspecified weaknesses within IBM DB2.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability is a file overwrite issue, where an unprivileged local user can overwrite files owned by the DB2 instance owner.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files owned by the DB2 instance owner. This could lead to various impacts, including:
  - Data corruption or loss by overwriting critical database files.
  - Denial of service by overwriting files required for normal database operation.
  - Potential privilege escalation if files related to database or OS-level processes can be overwritten.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have local access to the system running IBM DB2.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user on the system. No special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability affects IBM Db2 for Linux, UNIX and Windows, and includes DB2 Connect Server.
