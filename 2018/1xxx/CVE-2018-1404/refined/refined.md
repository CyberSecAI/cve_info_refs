- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation, allowing for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code into the Web UI of IBM Quality Manager (RQM).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary JavaScript code execution within the context of a user's session. This could potentially lead to credentials disclosure or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious JavaScript code through user-supplied input fields in the web UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires a user account with the ability to enter data into the Web UI. The attacker must be able to convince a victim to interact with the malicious payload (e.g. by viewing a crafted page), to trigger the XSS.
