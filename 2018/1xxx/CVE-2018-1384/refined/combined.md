## Remediation/Fixes

The recommended solution is to apply the Interim Fix (iFix) or Cumulative Fix (CF) containing APAR [JR58937](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR58937)as soon as practical:

* [IBM Business Process Manager](http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~WebSphere&product=ibm/WebSphere/IBM+Business+Process+Manager&release=All&platform=All&function=aparId&apars=JR58937)
* [IBM Business Process Manager Advanced](http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~WebSphere&product=ibm/WebSphere/IBM+Business+Process+Manager+Advanced&release=All&platform=All&function=aparId&apars=JR58937)
* [IBM Business Process Manager Standard](http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~WebSphere&product=ibm/WebSphere/IBM+Business+Process+Manager+Standard&release=All&platform=All&function=aparId&apars=JR58937)
* [IBM Business Process Manager Express](http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~WebSphere&product=ibm/WebSphere/IBM+Business+Process+Manager+Express&release=All&platform=All&function=aparId&apars=JR58937)
* WebSphere Process Server
* WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus (including WESB Registry Edition)

Because IBM Business Process Manager V7.5, V8.0 and WebSphere Process Server V7.0 are out of general support, fixes for V7.0, V7.5, V8.0 for these products and WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus V7.0 and V7.5 and WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus Registry Edition V7.0 and V7.5 can be requested from IBM support by eligible customers.
