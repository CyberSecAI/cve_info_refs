Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-1874:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Insecure caching

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is related to how IBM API Connect handles caching, specifically that caching is performed in an insecure manner.

**Impact of exploitation:** The document does not specify the exact impact of the vulnerability, but insecure caching can lead to various issues, such as:

*   **Exposure of sensitive data:** Cached data might contain sensitive information that could be accessed by unauthorized users.
*   **Data corruption:** Insecure caching mechanisms could be vulnerable to attacks that lead to data corruption.
*   **Denial of Service:** An attacker might be able to manipulate the cache, leading to a denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:** The document does not specify the attack vectors for this specific insecure caching vulnerability. However, common attack vectors related to insecure caching include:

*   **Cache poisoning:** An attacker could inject malicious data into the cache, which would then be served to other users.
*   **Cache injection:** An attacker might inject malicious data directly into the cache.
*   **Cache manipulation:** An attacker may manipulate cache keys to gain access to cached data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The document does not explicitly define the capabilities of an attacker, but exploitation likely requires:

*   **Network access:** The attacker would need network access to interact with the vulnerable API Connect instance.
*   **Understanding of caching mechanisms:** The attacker needs knowledge of the specific caching implementation in API Connect to exploit the vulnerability.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
* IBM API Connect versions 5.0.0.0 through 5.0.8.5

**Resolution:**
* Fixed in IBM API Connect V5.0.8.6 fixpack (APAR LI80397)
