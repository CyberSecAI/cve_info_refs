- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue in IBM InfoSphere Governance Catalog.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected XSS vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web browser of a user, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a crafted URL or other input that is reflected back to the user, allowing the injected script to execute in the user's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious input that will be reflected back to the user by the application. The attacker would likely need to trick the user into clicking on the malicious link.
