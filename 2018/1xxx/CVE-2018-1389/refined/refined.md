- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the generated LoopBack APIs for a Model using the BelongsTo/HasMany relationship. This allows for unauthorized modification of information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthorized modification of data due to insufficient access controls on related model data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can modify information via the vulnerable APIs. The specific impact is categorized as low integrity (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N), suggesting modification capabilities without causing widespread data breaches or system unavailability.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs low privileges (PR:L) to exploit this vulnerability. User interaction is not required (UI:N).
