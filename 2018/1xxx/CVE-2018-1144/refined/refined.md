Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2018-1144:

**CVE-2018-1144: Proxy.cgi Command Injection**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the `proxy.cgi` script not properly sanitizing user-supplied input, specifically the `url` parameter. It allows for command injection by interpreting backticks within the `url` parameter as commands.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the system.
    *   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `proxy.cgi` script fails to properly validate or sanitize the `url` parameter, allowing special characters like backticks and `${IFS%?}` to be interpreted.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute commands on the router with root privileges.
    *   **Full System Compromise:** With root command execution, the attacker can read sensitive information, modify configurations, or completely take over the device.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP request to the `proxy.cgi` script. The vulnerable parameter is named `url`.
    *   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable without requiring any authentication.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Belkin N750 router's web interface.
    *   **No Authentication Required:**  The attacker does not need any credentials to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   The attacker injects commands within backticks in the `url` parameter. The `${IFS%?}` is used to represent a space in the command.
*   Example of a successful exploit is provided:
    ```
    curl 'http://192.168.1.175:8080/proxy.cgi?url=`cat$\{IFS%?\}/proc/cpuinfo`'
    ```
*   The `cat /proc/cpuinfo` command execution allows an attacker to gather information from the device.
