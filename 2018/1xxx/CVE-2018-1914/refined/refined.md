- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw in IBM Rational Engineering Lifecycle Manager (RELM).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the presence of a cross-site scripting vulnerability. This allows the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code into the web UI.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to the execution of malicious JavaScript code within the context of a user's session. This could potentially lead to:
    - Altering the intended functionality of the web application.
    - Disclosure of user credentials or sensitive data within the trusted session.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the injection of malicious JavaScript code into the web UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to inject malicious code into input fields or other areas of the web UI that are not properly sanitized. The attacker would likely need to have a user interact with the injected code for successful execution (UI interaction). A low level of privilege is required.
