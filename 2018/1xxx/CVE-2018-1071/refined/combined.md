# RHSA-2018:3073 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: zsh security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A3073)

## Topic

An update for zsh is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The zsh shell is a command interpreter usable as an interactive login shell and as a shell script command processor. Zsh resembles the ksh shell (the Korn shell), but includes many enhancements. Zsh supports command-line editing, built-in spelling correction, programmable command completion, shell functions (with autoloading), a history mechanism, and more.

Security Fix(es):

* zsh: Stack-based buffer overflow in gen\_matches\_files() at compctl.c (CVE-2018-1083)
* zsh: buffer overflow for very long fds in >& fd syntax (CVE-2014-10071)
* zsh: buffer overflow when scanning very long directory paths for symbolic links (CVE-2014-10072)
* zsh: NULL dereference in cd in sh compatibility mode under given circumstances (CVE-2017-18205)
* zsh: buffer overrun in symlinks (CVE-2017-18206)
* zsh: Stack-based buffer overflow in exec.c:hashcmd() (CVE-2018-1071)
* zsh: buffer overflow in utils.c:checkmailpath() can lead to local arbitrary code execution (CVE-2018-1100)
* zsh: crash on copying empty hash table (CVE-2018-7549)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

The CVE-2018-1083, CVE-2018-1071, and CVE-2018-1100 issues were discovered by Richard Maciel Costa (Red Hat).

Additional Changes:

For detailed information on changes in this release, see the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 Release Notes linked from the References section.

                 CVE-2018-1100 CVE-2018-13259 CVE-2019-20044
Debian Bug     : 908000 894044 894043 895225 951458

Several security vulnerabilities were found and corrected in zsh, a powerful
shell and scripting language. Off-by-one errors, wrong parsing of shebang lines
and buffer overflows may lead to unexpected behavior. A local, unprivileged
user can create a specially crafted message file or directory path. If the
receiving user is privileged or traverses the aforementioned path, this leads
to privilege escalation.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
5.3.1-4+deb9u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your zsh packages.

For the detailed security status of zsh please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/zsh>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

Zsh is a UNIX command interpreter (shell) usable as an

 interactive login shell and as a shell script command

 processor. Of the standard shells, zsh most closely resembles

 ksh but includes many enhancements. Zsh has command-line editing,

 built-in spelling correction, programmable command completion,

 shell functions (with autoloading), a history mechanism, and a

 host of other features.

 .

 This is the statically-compiled version of the shell.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA512

Package        : zsh
Version        : 4.3.17-1+deb7u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-1071 CVE-2018-1083
Debian Bug     : 894044 894043

Two security vulnerabilities were discovered in the Z shell.

CVE-2018-1071
  Stack-based buffer overflow in the exec.c:hashcmd() function.
  A local attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2018-1083
  Buffer overflow in the shell autocomplete functionality. A local
  unprivileged user can create a specially crafted directory path which
  leads to code execution in the context of the user who tries to use
  autocomplete to traverse the before mentioned path. If the user
  affected is privileged, this leads to privilege escalation.

For Debian 7 "Wheezy", these problems have been fixed in version
4.3.17-1+deb7u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your zsh packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1557382#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2018-03-16 14:01:25 UTC  ``` zsh is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow in the gen_matches_files() function. A local attacker could exploit this through tab completion of directories with long names leading to arbitrary code execution.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1557382#c8)  Sam Fowler    2018-03-26 02:53:27 UTC  ``` Upstream Patch:  <https://sourceforge.net/p/zsh/code/ci/259ac472eac291c8c103c7a0d8a4eaf3c2942ed7>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1557382#c9)  Richard Maciel Costa    2018-03-26 19:10:55 UTC  ``` Created zsh tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1560696](show_bug.cgi?id=1560696 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-1083 zsh: Stack-based buffer overflow in gen_matches_files() at compctl.c [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1557382#c12)  Richard Maciel Costa    2018-05-25 13:13:45 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Richard Maciel Costa (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1557382#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-06-19 04:56:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2018:1932 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:1932](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A1932)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1557382#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-10-30 07:30:20 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2018:3073 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3073](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A3073)   ``` |  |
