- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A Zip Slip vulnerability exists in IBM Case Manager due to its ability to import solution package zip files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Zip Slip vulnerability. This vulnerability allows an attacker to write files to arbitrary locations on the system by manipulating the file paths within the zip archive.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary file write, potentially leading to code execution, system compromise, or data corruption.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could craft a malicious zip file containing specially crafted file paths and then upload this zip file to the IBM Case Manager for processing, leveraging the import functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to upload a malicious zip file to the IBM Case Manager application. This likely requires some level of access to the system, either through legitimate access to import functionality or by exploiting another vulnerability to gain the necessary access.
