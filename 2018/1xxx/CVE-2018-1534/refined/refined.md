Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1534:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the IBM Rational Publishing Engine.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the Web UI.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to:
- Embed arbitrary JavaScript code into the Web UI.
- Alter the intended functionality of the application.
- Potentially disclose credentials within a trusted session, which can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the Web UI of the Rational Publishing Engine. An attacker would inject malicious JavaScript code into a field or parameter that is not properly sanitized before being rendered in the user's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker requires the ability to interact with the web UI.
- They need to have a user account and be able to provide input, likely to a form or field within the application.
- No specific privilege level is mentioned, but low-privileged users can be affected (CVSS vector has 'PR:L').
- The attacker needs to entice a user to load a webpage containing the malicious javascript (CVSS vector has 'UI:R').
