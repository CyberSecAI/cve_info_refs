Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1133:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is within the "calculated question type" in Moodle. It allows a teacher (or a user with similar permissions) to inject arbitrary code through a specially crafted formula within a quiz question. This code is then executed server-side when the quiz is processed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input within the calculated question formula, allowing for code injection.
*   **Insecure use of `$_GET`:** The exploit leverages the `$_GET` superglobal to pass and execute the payload, highlighting a lack of control over input parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete System Compromise:** Successful exploitation leads to complete control of the server hosting the Moodle instance, enabling data exfiltration, system manipulation, or further attacks.
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers could gain access to sensitive user data stored within the Moodle platform, including personal information, course content, and grades.
*   **Malware Distribution:** The server could be used to host and distribute malicious content to users who access the Moodle site.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could disrupt normal service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Calculated Question Type:** The primary attack vector is the calculated question type within a quiz.
*   **Code Injection:** The attacker crafts a malicious formula within the question, embedding server-side code.
*   **HTTP Request:** The attack uses an HTTP GET request to trigger the payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Teacher Role or Equivalent:** The attacker needs a user account with the ability to create or edit quizzes, including the calculated question type. This typically requires a "teacher" or similar role within a course.
*   **Knowledge of Moodle:** The attacker needs knowledge of Moodle's quiz functionality and the specific vulnerability in the calculated question type.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Moodle platform.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit uses a PHP script to automate the attack process.
*   The script performs actions such as:
    *   Logging into Moodle as a teacher.
    *   Enabling course editing.
    *   Adding a new quiz.
    *   Configuring the quiz.
    *   Adding a calculated question.
    *   Injecting a malicious code snippet within a calculated question formula.
    *   Triggering execution using an HTTP GET request containing the payload.
*   The payload is designed to establish a reverse shell back to the attacker's machine.
*  The vulnerability is present in Moodle versions 3.4 to 3.4.2, 3.3 to 3.3.5, 3.2 to 3.2.8, 3.1 to 3.1.11 and earlier unsupported versions.
*   Fixed versions: 3.5, 3.4.3, 3.3.6, 3.2.9 and 3.1.12.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information includes a complete exploit script, which shows the detailed steps and code needed to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Robin Peraglie.
*   The exploit utilizes the `$_GET` superglobal to pass the payload, demonstrating a vulnerability within the `question.php` script.
* The exploit uses a reverse shell payload, but the attacker can insert any code to execute server side.
*   The content from `ripstech.com` provides additional context about the vulnerability and a link to a related blog post.

This vulnerability is considered serious, as it allows for unauthenticated remote code execution, leading to complete system compromise. Users of vulnerable versions should upgrade immediately to the fixed versions.
