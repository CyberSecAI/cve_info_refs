- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is not explicitly stated but it can be inferred that the vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization or output encoding in the web UI of the IBM Rational Quality Manager (RQM).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability is present in the IBM Rational Quality Manager.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web UI, leading to:
    - Altered intended functionality of the application.
    - Potential disclosure of user credentials within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the web UI of the IBM Rational Quality Manager. An attacker can inject malicious javascript code through user input which will be executed by the victim user's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to inject malicious JavaScript code into the application. This often requires a low privileged user account, but it could also be accomplished in other ways, depending on the specific vulnerable application. The attacker needs to have access to the web UI.
