Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of user input within the `cheatSheetURI` parameter in the IBM WebSphere Application Server Admin Console. This lack of validation allows attackers to inject arbitrary file paths.
*   The vulnerability is exacerbated by the fact that external XML DTD entities are enabled by default in the WebSphere Application Server configuration.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is directory traversal via the `cheatSheetURI` parameter, allowing access to files outside of the intended directory structure.
*   **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** By crafting a malicious XML file with an external entity declaration, attackers can force the server to read and disclose the contents of arbitrary files on the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive files on the server, potentially including configuration files, credentials, and other confidential data. This could lead to further compromise of the system or network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the WebSphere Admin Console, specifically targeting the `cheatSheetNav.jsp` endpoint and manipulating the `cheatSheetURI` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with sufficient privileges to create files on the WebSphere Application Server system.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the WebSphere Application Server.

**Technical Details:**
*   An attacker must first create a malicious XML file on the server, containing an external entity declaration pointing to the file they wish to read (e.g. /etc/passwd). Example of such a malicious file:
    ```xml
    <!ENTITY % rrr SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
    <cheatsheet><intro><description>&rrr;</description></intro></cheatsheet>
    ```
*   The attacker then uses directory traversal in the `cheatSheetURI` parameter in a URL to force the WebSphere server to parse the malicious XML file, thereby disclosing the content of the file pointed to by the external entity (e.g. /etc/passwd). Example URL:
    ```
    https://<IP address of your server>:9043/ibm/console/guidedactivity/cheatSheetNav.jsp?cheatSheetURI=../../../../../../../../../../../tmp/1.xml
    ```
**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Tenable while developing a Nessus plugin.
*   IBM initially did not consider the XXE to be a vulnerability, but later changed their position.
*   IBM released patches for versions 7, 8, 8.5, and 9 of WebSphere Application Server to address this issue.
