Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-1549:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation, allowing an attacker to inject malicious data into HTTP responses.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **HTTP Response Splitting:** The core issue is that the IBM Quality Manager (RQM) is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting attacks. This occurs when the application fails to sanitize user-controlled data that's incorporated into HTTP headers. By crafting a URL with malicious input, an attacker can insert additional HTTP headers or even entire HTTP responses into the server's output, causing a split response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  Successful exploitation could lead to:
    - **Web cache poisoning:** An attacker could poison the cache with malicious content, leading to further attacks against users who access the poisoned content from the cache.
    - **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** By injecting malicious scripts into HTTP responses, the attacker can achieve XSS, potentially stealing user credentials, session cookies, or performing other malicious actions within the context of a user's session.
   - **Sensitive information disclosure:** It could be possible for attackers to obtain sensitive information via crafted responses.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is conducted remotely over a network.
- **URL Manipulation:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by crafting a specific URL containing malicious characters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  **Low Privilege Access:** An attacker needs only to have low privilege user access to the application.
-  **User Interaction:** The victim user needs to click the malicious URL for the attack to be effective.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided text does not describe the specific characters or URL parameters that are vulnerable.
- The affected versions are specified.
- Fixes for this vulnerability are available in specific iFix releases for the affected products and versions.
