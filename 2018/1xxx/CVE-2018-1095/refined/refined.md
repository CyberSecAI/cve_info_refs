{
  "CVE-2018-1095": {
    "description": "The Linux kernel through version 4.15 is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference in the fs/posix_acl.c:get_acl() function. A privileged attacker could exploit this to cause a NULL pointer dereference with a crafted ext4 image.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a missing size validation of the extended attribute (xattr) value size, which can lead to an out-of-bounds access.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Out-of-bounds read due to lack of size validation in xattr handling",
        "Use of an unvalidated size of xattr value resulting in memory corruption."
       ],
      "impact": "An attacker can cause a system crash or unspecified impact by mounting a crafted ext4 image which triggers the out-of-bounds memory access in the get_acl() function.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Mounting a crafted ext4 image",
        "Accessing the filesystem leading to an out-of-bounds memory access."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "A privileged attacker (e.g., root user) is required to mount the crafted ext4 image to trigger the vulnerability. However, an attacker could also trick a user into mounting the crafted image (e.g. via an auto-mounted USB drive).",
       "attacker_position": "The attacker needs local access to the system where the crafted image will be mounted or needs to trick a user into mounting it"
    }
