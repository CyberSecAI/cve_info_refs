- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A directory traversal vulnerability exists when an Enterprise Bundle Archive (EBA) with an external path is installed into the WebSphere Application Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory traversal. The vulnerability stems from the way the application server handles EBA installations, specifically when the EBA contains paths that go outside of the expected EBA structure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The security bulletin does not specify the exact impact but a directory traversal vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to files and directories outside the intended scope, potentially leading to information disclosure or other attacks depending on the files exposed.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the installation of a specially crafted EBA file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to install an EBA file to the WebSphere Application Server, which suggests they would likely need some level of administrative or deployment privileges.
