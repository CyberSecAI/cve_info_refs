The content is related to CVE-2018-3880.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `video-core` process of the Samsung SmartThings Hub when handling existing records inside its SQLite database. Specifically, the `db_camera_by_id` function copies data from the database into a stack buffer without checking its size, which can lead to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-120) due to unchecked data copy from the database to a fixed-size stack buffer.
- Lack of input validation on the data fetched from the database, specifically the length of the string copied using `memcpy`.
- The `memcpy` function copies the `query_result` string using the length of the string itself, without validating against the destination buffer's capacity.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Code execution on the `video-core` process, which runs as root.
- Potential for complete system compromise since the vulnerable process runs with root privileges.
- When combined with TALOS-2018-0556, it can lead to remote code execution with a higher CVSS score (9.9).

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can send an HTTP DELETE request to the `/cameras/<camera-id>` path of the `video-core`'s HTTP server.
- The HTTP request is relayed to the `video-core` process from the `hubCore` process.
- The attacker must first populate the database with a crafted entry containing an overly long string in at least one column. This is possible through a separate vulnerability (TALOS-2018-0556).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the `hubCore` process to send a crafted HTTP request.
- The attacker needs to be able to insert a crafted record with an overly long string into the video-core database through another vulnerability (TALOS-2018-0556).
- The attacker needs to know the camera ID in the database.
- The attacker can achieve this through local access to the hub via the network, or potentially by compromising the remote SmartThings server infrastructure that has access to the hub.
- The attacker could use a SmartApp (an application running on the SmartThings ecosystem) to trigger the vulnerability.
