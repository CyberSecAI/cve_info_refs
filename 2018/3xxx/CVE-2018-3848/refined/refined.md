Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-3848:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow.
- It occurs in the `ffghbn` function of the CFITSIO library when parsing a FITS image.
- The `sprintf` function is used without proper bounds checking, leading to the overflow. Specifically, the error message created by sprintf can exceed the buffer size if the "name" parameter is too long.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `sprintf` function is used to format a string into a fixed-size buffer on the stack.
- The format string includes a user-controlled value read from the FITS header (`value` parameter).
- Lack of bounds checking on the formatted output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause a stack-based buffer overflow.
- This could lead to arbitrary code execution by overwriting data on the stack including the return address.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker crafts a malicious FITS file with a specially formatted header.
- The vulnerable code path is reached when the function parses the header.
- The overflow occurs when `sprintf` is called to create an error message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted FITS image file to a system that uses a vulnerable version of the CFITSIO library.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- User interaction is required (i.e., a user has to open or process a malicious FITS file).
