- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Telegram Android application uses the `MediaStore.ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE` intent to take pictures for secret chats. This delegates the actual photo capture to another application (usually the native camera app). While Telegram specifies where the photo should be stored initially, the native camera app can save a second copy of the photo to the device's file system. When the secret chat is deleted, Telegram only removes its copy of the image, leaving the copy created by the camera application.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information Disclosure vulnerability due to the incomplete removal of photo data associated with deleted secret chats.

- **Impact of exploitation**:  Photos shared in "Secret Chats" remain accessible on the device's file system, even after the chat is deleted. This leads to the exposure of potentially sensitive information to any application with access to the device's storage.

- **Attack vectors**: An attacker would require access to the target device's file system (e.g., through malware, physical access, or another vulnerable application) to view these photos. 

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have a means of accessing the device's file system where the additional copies of the photos are stored. This could involve having a malicious application installed on the device, physical access, or exploiting another vulnerability to achieve file system access. The attacker also needs to know where to look for the photos. The vulnerability exists even when a chat is self-destructed.
