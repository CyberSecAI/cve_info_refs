Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-3829:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper authentication when bootstrapping new runners in Elastic Cloud Enterprise (ECE) versions prior to 1.1.4. Specifically, a user could scale out allocators on new hosts using an invalid roles token.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper authentication.
- Lack of proper revocation of role tokens for previously deleted runner roles.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with access to the previous runner ID and IP address of the coordinator host could add a new allocator to an existing ECE installation.
- This could lead to unauthorized access to data within other clusters.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network access to the ECE environment
- Knowledge of a previous runner ID
- Knowledge of the coordinator host's IP address
- Ability to add a new allocator

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the ECE environment.
- Access to a previous runner ID and the IP address of the coordinator host.
- Ability to add new allocators to the ECE setup.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in all ECE versions prior to 1.1.4
- The fix is to upgrade to version 1.1.4 or later. This ensures role tokens are properly revoked for previous deleted runner roles.
