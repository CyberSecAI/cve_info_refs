I am new to Elastic Cloud enterprise,

I have succesfully installed elastic cloud enterprise on centos machines, but when i restarted the machine, i am trying to access the UI and i am unable to access it, hence i went a head with installation and got the below error.

Is there a way to come out of this issues after the reboot

The install failed because you weren't quite thorough enough in cleansing the old install - see <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-enterprise/current/ece-uninstall.html>

(Reboot should work fine, so do post here if it fails after a reboot once you've gotten the install up again)

Yes, ok may i ask how to check the status of the elastic cloud or restart the service once the virtual instance is restarted

Could you give more details on what you are after? The docker service should restart all the required ECE services on reboot

The UI will report the status of the platform (it uses an undocumented -but easily reverse-engineerable- legacy API to do this currently, though the documented one is coming soon)

where are the zone's in elastic cloud enterprise, how to check the zones

to add more nodes, i am specifying it as coordinator nodes and adding them, could you pls help me with the node roles

How does backup works in elastic cloud enterprise

In what cases is elastic cloud enterprise is choosen eg:- any data size could you please specify, I understand that the use cases may vary just an example could help

Sorry for not replying, was tied up for a few days

> In what cases Elastic cloud enterprise is charged to customers, i have installed elastic cloud enterprise in two nodes wondering in what cases we will be charged

The download gives a free trial, after that you need to get licenses -[Have questions? Contact Elastic | Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/cloud/contact)

> where are the zone's in elastic cloud enterprise, how to check the zones

When you add new hosts you can specify the zones: see `--availability-zone` [elastic-cloud-enterprise.sh install | Elastic Cloud Enterprise Reference [3.6] | Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-enterprise/current/ece-installation-script.html)

> to add more nodes, i am specifying it as coordinator nodes and adding them, could you pls help me with the node roles

you can install with no roles and then add them from the UI (platform > runner)m see [Assign roles to hosts | Elastic Cloud Enterprise Reference [3.6] | Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-enterprise/current/ece-change-roles.html), or more details on how to use roles are: [Generate roles tokens | Elastic Cloud Enterprise Reference [2.1] | Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-enterprise/2.1/ece-generate-roles-token.html)

> How does backup works in elastic cloud enterprise

There's ES and ECE level backup. For ES backup we use snapshots to either S3, GCP, Azure, or minio (which can store locally or act as a gateway to other store)

For ECE backup a "proper" disaster recovery is in the works. Currently running multi-zone is the main protection. We have worked with customers through support to help people integrate our "alpha" backup and restore into their own environment

> In what cases is elastic cloud enterprise is choosen eg:- any data size could you please specify, I understand that the use cases may vary just an example could help

Generally the main benefits of ECE come with:

* being able to provision and manage elements of the stack via a UI
* being able to provision and manage multiple deployments

So our -obviously biased!- claim would be that ECE is a great choice for almost any production environment ![:slight_smile:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12 ":slight_smile:")

Hi Alex,

Thanks a lot for your response,

Appreciate it, I am still doing the POC and getting ready, before we purchase license.

I am trying to upload the SSL certificate which i genereated through lets encrypt.

I am getting an error "Certificate chain was invalid [Invalid Entry: expected unencrypted rsa private key]"

then i encrypted using the

openssl rsa -in server.key -out server\_new.key

iam getting another error "Certificate chain was invalid [Missing Entry: expected at least server and CA certificates]"

Could you please help here

# Security issues

## Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure

Elastic values our partnership with the security community and shares the goal of keeping our users and the internet safe. Please report potential security vulnerabilities affecting any of Elastic's products, the Elastic Cloud Service, or the elastic.co website via our [HackerOne bug bounty program](https://hackerone.com/elastic?type=team). For detailed scope and rules of engagement please refer to our HackerOne program [policy](https://hackerone.com/elastic?view_policy=true).

Under the principles of Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure, Elastic analyzes potential security vulnerabilities to identify any recommended mitigations or product updates and coordinates disclosures via Elastic Security Advisories (ESA) and the CVE program. Elastic requests that you do not post or share any information about potential vulnerabilities in any public forum until we have researched and responded to the issue.

## Other security issues

Users and customers may report any other potential security issues to security@elastic.co. This address can be used for product security related inquiries or requests about other security topics that are not explicitly mentioned here. We can accept only security issues at this address. Bug reports should be directed to the bug database of the project you're reporting it on or raised to Elastic Support.

If you would like to encrypt your message to us, please use our PGP key. The fingerprint is

## Elastic Security Advisories

An Elastic Security Advisory (ESA) is an announcement about a security issue with one or more Elastic products. Elastic assigns a CVE and an ESA identifier to each advisory and publishes a summary of the issue with remediation and mitigation details. All new advisories are announced in the [Security Announcements](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/announcements/security-announcements) forum.

**Elastic Cloud Enterprise use of shared encryption key (ESA-2018-09)**

In Elastic Cloud Enterprise (ECE) versions prior to 1.1.4 a default master encryption key is used in the process of granting ZooKeeper access to Elasticsearch clusters. Unless explicitly overwritten, this master key is predictable across all ECE deployments. If an attacker can connect to ZooKeeper directly they would be able to access configuration information of other tenants if their cluster ID is known. In addition to ZooKeeper access, to exploit this vulnerability the attacker must chain this with an remote code execution (of which there are currently no known vulnerabilities).

**Affected Versions:** All ECE versions prior to 1.1.4

**Solutions and Mitigations:**

New deployments should target 1.1.4 or greater release. It is recommended that existing deployments perform an upgrade. Additionally ECE deployments that expose access to ZooKeeper, and if the deployment is susceptible to remote code execution, are recommended to rotate their existing credentials using a cleanup script. Please find instructions and more information in this [knowledge base article](https://support.elastic.co/customers/s/article/ka0610000005hvq).

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-3825

**Elastic Cloud Enterprise Information Exposure Vulnerability (ESA-2018-12)**

Elastic Cloud Enterprise (ECE) versions prior to 1.1.4 contain an information exposure vulnerability. It was discovered that certain exception conditions would result in encryption keys, passwords, and other security sensitive headers being leaked to the allocator logs. An attacker with access to the logging cluster may obtain leaked credentials and perform authenticated actions using these credentials.

**Affected Versions:**

All ECE versions prior to 1.1.4

**Solutions and Mitigations:**

All users of Elastic Cloud Enterprise should upgrade to version 1.1.4. This ensure credentials are properly redacted under error conditions.

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-3828

**Elastic Cloud Enterprise Improper authentication used when bootstrapping new runners (ESA-2018-13)**

In Elastic Cloud Enterprise (ECE) versions prior to 1.1.4 it was discovered that a user could scale out allocators on new hosts with an invalid roles token. An attacker with access to the previous runner ID and IP address of the coordinator-host could add a allocator to an existing ECE install to gain access to other clusters data.

**Affected Versions:**

All ECE versions prior to 1.1.4

**Solutions and Mitigations:**

All users of Elastic Cloud Enterprise should upgrade to version 1.1.4. This ensure role tokens are properly revoked for previous deleted runner roles.

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-3829
