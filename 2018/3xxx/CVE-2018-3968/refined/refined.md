- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper FIT signature enforcement in Das U-Boot versions 2013.07-rc1 to 2014.07-rc2. These versions allowed booting of both signed FIT images and unsigned "legacy" image formats without proper checks, bypassing the intended verified boot process.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Improper verification of cryptographic signatures (CWE-347).
    - Failure to enforce signature checks on legacy image formats.
    - Lack of a configuration option to disable legacy image booting.

- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass U-Boot's verified boot mechanism and execute an unsigned kernel, which leads to persistent compromise of the device with arbitrary code execution capabilities. In the specific context of the CUJO Smart Firewall, this allows a local attacker with root privileges to persistently gain control over the device, even after rebooting.

- **Attack vectors:**
    - Local access to the device through a previously exploited vulnerability or physical access to the device.
    - The attacker must be able to supply a crafted, unsigned image to boot from.
    - The attacker needs to modify the boot partition or the mechanism responsible for choosing the boot image.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs either physical access to the device or local access through a previously exploited vulnerability to gain root privileges.
    -  The ability to modify the boot partition or otherwise control the image that the bootloader loads and executes.
    - The ability to create and prepare a malicious unsigned kernel image.
