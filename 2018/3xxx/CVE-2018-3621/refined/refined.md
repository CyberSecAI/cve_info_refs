- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input validation in the Intel Driver & Support Assistant.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software does not properly validate input, which could lead to an exploitable condition.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** Adjacent access, meaning an attacker needs to be on the same local network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An unauthenticated user with adjacent network access, user interaction is required for exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Intel Driver & Support Assistant versions before 3.6.0.4.
*   The CVSS score is 4.6, indicating a medium severity.
*   The CVSS vector string `CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L` provides detailed information:
    *   **AV:A (Adjacent):** The attacker must be on the same network segment.
    *   **AC:H (High):** The conditions for a successful attack are somewhat difficult to satisfy.
    *   **PR:N (None):** No privileges are required for the attacker.
    *   **UI:R (Required):** User interaction is required.
    *   **S:U (Unchanged):** A vulnerability that does not affect other components beyond the vulnerable one.
    *   **C:L (Low):** Limited information disclosure.
    *  **I:L (Low):** Limited impact on data integrity.
    *   **A:L (Low):** Limited impact on system availability.
