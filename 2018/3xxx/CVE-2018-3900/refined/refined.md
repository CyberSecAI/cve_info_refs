- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stack-based buffer overflow in the `b64_decode` function used when processing data from a QR code. The function does not properly validate the length of the decoded data, allowing for an overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Lack of size constraints in the base64 decoding function (`b64_decode`).
    - Reusing stack memory as the source and destination for decoding, allowing controlled overwrite of return addresses.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution on the device. By overflowing the stack, the attacker can overwrite the return address and gain control of the program flow.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - An attacker can create a malicious QR code that, when scanned by the camera, triggers the buffer overflow.
    - A user could be tricked into scanning a malicious QR code displayed online.
    - The server could return a malicious bindkey containing crafted `p` and `s` strings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to present a malicious QR code to the camera. This could involve physical access, or tricking a user into scanning an attacker-controlled QR code. In addition, a malicious server could return a crafted response that triggers the vulnerability.
