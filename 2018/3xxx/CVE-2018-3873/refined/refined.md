The provided content relates to CVE-2018-3873.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a series of stack-based buffer overflows in the `credentials` handler of the `video-core`'s HTTP server of the Samsung SmartThings Hub. The `video-core` process incorrectly extracts fields from a user-controlled JSON payload, leading to buffer overflows on the stack due to the use of `strncpy` without proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist, triggered by the following parameters in the JSON payload:
- "secretKey" (CVE-2018-3873)
- "accessKey" (CVE-2018-3874)
- "sessionToken" (CVE-2018-3875)
- "bucket" (CVE-2018-3876)
- "directory" (CVE-2018-3877)
- "region" (CVE-2018-3878)

The `strncpy` function copies the string extracted from the JSON object to a stack buffer. The length of the copy is determined by the length of the string, without any check to ensure that it fits within the destination buffer, leading to overflows.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution on the `video-core` process, which runs as root.

**Attack vectors:**
- Impersonating the remote SmartThings servers and sending malicious HTTP requests to `hubCore`, which are then relayed to `video-core`.
- Creating a malicious SmartThings SmartApp that can send HTTP requests directly to the vulnerable `video-core` process.
- Potentially sending a malicious request via the SmartThings mobile application, which would then be relayed by the remote SmartThings servers to the device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- For the first vector, the attacker needs to be able to impersonate the remote SmartThings servers or have compromised them.
- For the second vector, the attacker needs to be able to create and install a malicious SmartThings SmartApp on the hub.
- For the third vector, the attacker would need a valid OAuth bearer token or username/password combination for the SmartThings account.
- In all cases the attacker has to send a crafted HTTP request.
