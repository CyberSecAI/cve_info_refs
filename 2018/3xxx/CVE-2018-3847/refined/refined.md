Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-3847:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `ffgkyn` function of the CFITSIO library. This function is responsible for reading a key-value pair from a FITS image.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `sprintf` function is used to format an error message and copy it to a local buffer (`sbuff`). However, `sprintf` lacks bounds checking, allowing an attacker to overflow this buffer on the stack.
- **Unvalidated Input:** The `keyname` parameter to `ffgkyn`, derived from the FITS image, is not properly validated for length before being used in the `sprintf` call. Although `keyname` is limited to 72 bytes, the added error message makes it longer than the buffer's capacity.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** By overflowing the buffer, an attacker can overwrite other data on the stack, including the return address, and potentially gain code execution.
- **Denial of service:** Even without achieving full code execution, the overflow could lead to a crash, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious FITS image:** An attacker can create a specially crafted FITS image that contains an illegal character in a keyword. This image, when parsed by a vulnerable application using the CFITSIO library, will trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide or cause the processing of a malicious FITS image via an application using the vulnerable CFITSIO library. The attack vector is remote, which suggests the image may be delivered over a network connection to a server or user application.
- The user interaction requirement suggests the user will need to open or process a malicious file in order for the attack to be triggered.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable `sprintf` is used to generate an error message, not directly related to the image content being read.
- The vulnerability is present when an illegal character is found in the keyword during parsing
- The `keyname` parameter is derived from the input FITS image.
- The fix involves upgrading to cfitsio version 3.490 or later.
