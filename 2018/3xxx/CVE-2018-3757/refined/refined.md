Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2018-3757:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way the `node-pdf-image` library constructs shell commands for `pdfinfo` and `convert` (or `gm convert`). Specifically, it uses `util.format` to build these commands by directly inserting the PDF file path and other parameters into the command string. This approach is vulnerable to command injection if the file path or options contain malicious shell metacharacters. The fix replaces `util.format` with the use of `child-process-promise` to spawn the commands with the file path passed as an argument instead of within the command string.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The core weakness is the use of `util.format` to create shell commands, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands through the `pdfFilePath` or options parameters.
*   **Unsafe Parameter Handling:** The library directly incorporates user-controlled input (the PDF file path and convert options) into shell commands without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the server running the `node-pdf-image` library.
*   **System Compromise:** This can lead to complete compromise of the affected system, including data theft, malware installation, and denial-of-service attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PDF File Path:** An attacker could provide a specially crafted PDF file path containing shell metacharacters (e.g., `"; rm -rf /"`).
*   **Malicious Convert Options:** The attacker can inject malicious options via the `convertOptions` parameter that could lead to command execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to control the PDF file path or the convert options passed to the `node-pdf-image` library. This could happen if the application uses the library to process user-provided PDF files or converts a file from a location where the name of the file is user-controlled.

**Code Changes Summary:**

The provided diff shows the following key changes to address the vulnerability:

*   **Replaced `exec` with `spawn`:** The code replaces calls to `child_process.exec` with `child-process-promise.spawn`. This allows passing arguments as an array instead of constructing a single string.
*   **Command and arguments separation:** Instead of formatting commands using `util.format`, the code now creates an object with `cmd` and `args`. `cmd` is the command to execute, and `args` is an array of arguments. This prevents command injection by ensuring the arguments are not interpreted as shell commands
*   **Removed `util.format` usage:** Instances of `util.format` are removed to build the command, thus mitigating command injection issues.

This commit effectively addresses the command injection vulnerability by properly separating commands from their arguments.
