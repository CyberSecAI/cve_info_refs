- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the parsing of a tiled TIFF image with the Adobe Deflate compression scheme. Specifically, during the building of a Huffman table, user-controlled data from the TIFF image is used without proper validation, leading to an out-of-bounds write.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists due to lack of validation of user-controlled data during Huffman table construction in the TIFF image parsing process.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution by exploiting this out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by delivering a specially crafted TIFF image to the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious TIFF file to the vulnerable application. User interaction (opening the malicious image) is needed.
