- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Signal Messenger application for Android uses the Android MediaStore class to handle photo capture when using the "Attach File" menu instead of using Signal's own photo-taking code, leading to the photo being stored in a cache directory that is accessible to other applications on the system.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure via a cache directory that is not properly cleared, even when the "disappearing messages" feature is enabled, thus exposing the photo to other applications.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized disclosure of private information (photos) to other applications on the user's device.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation requires another malicious application on the same device to access the Signal's cache directory.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the same device as the vulnerable Signal Messenger application. The user must also use the "Attach File" option within signal, which then uses the MediaStore class, to take a photo.
