  "CVE-2018-3946": {
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a use-after-free condition that occurs when the `getPageNthWord` method of the active document is invoked with a crafted object as an argument. When the `toString` method of the crafted object is called, it closes the active document, freeing objects in memory. However, `getPageNthWord` continues its execution, attempting to access the freed object through a stale pointer.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Use-after-free (CWE-416)"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
      "Attack vectors": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted PDF document.  If the browser plugin is enabled, a malicious site can also trigger the vulnerability.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious PDF file or visiting a malicious site with an enabled browser plugin. The attacker must craft a specific PDF document with the vulnerable javascript code."
    },
    "additional_information": "The provided content includes a detailed analysis of the crash resulting from the use-after-free vulnerability. The crash analysis shows that a pointer to a freed memory region is dereferenced and subsequently used as a function pointer, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. This analysis goes into detail beyond the official CVE description."
