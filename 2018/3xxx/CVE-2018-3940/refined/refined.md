    "Description": "An exploitable use-after-free vulnerability exists in the JavaScript engine of Foxit Softwareâ€™s PDF Reader, version 9.1.0.5096. A specially crafted PDF document can trigger a previously freed object in memory to be reused, resulting in arbitrary code execution.

If the browser plugin extension is enabled, visiting a malicious site can also trigger the vulnerability.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in invoking the `removeDataObject` method of the active document with a crafted object as argument, which triggers a use-after-free condition.",
    "Weaknesses": [

    "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution",
    "Attack vector": "Specially crafted PDF document. If the browser plugin extension is enabled, visiting a malicious site can also trigger the vulnerability.",
