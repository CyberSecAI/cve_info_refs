- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Use-after-free in the JavaScript engine of Foxit PDF Reader. A stale reference to a freed object is reused during document closing.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use-after-free (CWE-416). Specifically, a combination of `createTemplate` and `closeDoc` methods in JavaScript can cause a memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution. By controlling the freed memory, an attacker can manipulate the `this` pointer, leading to control flow hijacking and arbitrary code execution through a vtable dereference.
- **Attack vectors**:
  - Opening a specially crafted PDF document.
  - Visiting a malicious website if the browser plugin extension is enabled.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick the user into opening a malicious PDF file or visiting a malicious webpage. The attacker also needs to have some control over the freed memory to achieve arbitrary code execution.
