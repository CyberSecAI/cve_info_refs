    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2018-3945",
      "Description": "An exploitable use-after-free vulnerability exists in the JavaScript engine of Foxit Softwareâ€™s Foxit PDF Reader version 9.1.0.5096. A specially crafted PDF document can trigger a previously freed object in memory to be reused, resulting in arbitrary code execution. An attacker needs to trick the user to open the malicious file to trigger this vulnerability. If the browser plugin extension is enabled, visiting a malicious site can also trigger the vulnerability.",
      "Product": "Foxit PDF Reader",
      "Vendor": "Foxit Software",
      "Version": "9.1.0.5096"
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in invoking `JSON.Stringify` method of the active document with `this.info` object as argument. When a document is closed, the JavaScript can continue to execute, and if a method keeps a stale reference to a now-freed object, it can lead to a use-after-free condition.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Use-After-Free vulnerability"
      ],
      "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution",
        "Attack vectors": [
        "A specially crafted PDF document",
            "Malicious site if browser plugin is enabled"
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
        "Attacker needs to trick the user to open the malicious file."
