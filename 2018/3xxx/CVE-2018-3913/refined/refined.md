- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `video-core` process in Samsung SmartThings Hub uses the `strcpy` function to copy data retrieved from the "shard" table of its SQLite database into a fixed-size buffer on the stack without checking the size of the input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Multiple stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities due to insecure use of `strcpy`. Specifically, the `secretKey`, `accessKey`, `sessionToken`, `bucket`, `directory`, and `region` fields from the "shard" table can be used to cause overflows when copied into their respective stack buffers.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution on the `video-core` process, which runs as root.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can send a crafted HTTP request to the `video-core` HTTP server, which runs on the localhost port 3000. The request is relayed through the `hubCore` process. This HTTP request must include a crafted SQL injection payload within the JSON parameters to modify the values of the vulnerable fields in the `shard` database.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to communicate with the `hubCore` process to send the crafted HTTP requests to the `video-core` process. This could be achieved by exploiting another vulnerability or having privileged access to the network.
