Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Unquoted service paths in the IntelÂ® Quartus family of tools.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Unquoted Service Paths:** The JTAG server within the Intel Quartus tools utilizes unquoted service paths. This means the system searches for the executable along the given path, and if a malicious actor places an executable with the same name in an earlier directory in the path, the malicious executable will be run instead of the intended one.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges. This occurs because the vulnerable service runs with elevated privileges, and the replacement of the intended executable allows the attacker's malicious code to inherit those privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system where the affected Intel Quartus tools are installed.
*   **File Replacement:** The attacker replaces the legitimate JTAG server executable with their own malicious executable. This replacement is possible due to the use of unquoted service paths.
*   **System Reboot:** The malicious code is executed with elevated privileges upon a system reboot, when the vulnerable service is started.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local User:** The attacker needs to have the ability to log into the system locally.
*   **File System Access:** The attacker needs write access to directories in the service path to place their malicious executable.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The content specifically mentions the JTAG server as being vulnerable.
*   The affected product versions are listed clearly.
*   The document provides a link to a patch and also recommends updating to version 18.1 or later.
*   The CVEs related to this vulnerability, CVE-2018-3683, CVE-2018-3684, CVE-2018-3687, and CVE-2018-3688, are mentioned.
