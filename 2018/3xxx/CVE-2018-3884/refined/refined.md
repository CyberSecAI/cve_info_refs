The provided content is related to CVE-2018-3884.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper input sanitization in the `sort_by` and `start` parameters within the ERPNext application. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands into the database queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `sort_by` and `start` parameters, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL code.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not validate or sanitize user-provided parameters before incorporating them into SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to the database, allowing an attacker to read, modify, or delete sensitive data.
- **Potential for Full System Compromise:** Depending on the database permissions and configuration, the attacker may gain the ability to execute arbitrary code on the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Requests:** The vulnerable parameters are submitted through HTTP POST requests to the server.
- **Browser-based Attacks:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability using a regular web browser without the need for any special tools.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have valid user credentials to access the authenticated portion of the ERPNext application where the vulnerable parameters are used.
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network connectivity to send requests to the server.
