    "Metadata": {
      "Curation Status": "Relevant",
      "Source": "www.foxitsoftware.com_72e4ecf0_20250126_004708.html & talosintelligence.com_aab3b0bb_20250126_004700.html",
      "Original Description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval"
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root cause": "An exploitable use-after-free vulnerability exists in the JavaScript engine of Foxit Softwareâ€™s PDF Reader. When executing embedded JavaScript code, a document can be closed, which essentially frees numerous used objects, but the JavaScript can continue to execute. A use-after-free condition can be created by invoking a method that keeps a stale reference to a now-freed object.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Use-After-Free"
      ],
      "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution is possible. An attacker needs to trick the user to open the malicious file to trigger this vulnerability. If the browser plugin extension is enabled, visiting a malicious site can also trigger the vulnerability.",
       "Attack Vectors": [
        "Specially crafted PDF documents",
         "Malicious websites (if browser plugin is enabled)"
      ],
     "Required Capabilities": "An attacker needs to trick the user to open the malicious PDF file or visit a malicious site."
    }
