Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-3632:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to memory corruption in Intel Active Management Technology (AMT) within the Intel Converged Security and Management Engine (CSME) firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability exists in Intel CSME firmware versions 6.x/7.x/8.x/9.x/10.x/11.0/11.5/11.6/11.7/11.10/11.20.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service (DoS), or privilege escalation. Specifically, it could allow an attacker to gain high level privileges on the system (C:H/I:H/A:H).

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is local (AV:L).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have local administrator permissions on the system (PR:H) to trigger the vulnerability. The attack does not require user interaction (UI:N).

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects a wide range of Intel processors including various generations of Core and Xeon processors used in corporate PCs, IoT devices, workstations, and servers.
- Intel recommends that users update to the specified firmware versions or higher, which are listed in the advisory.
- The issue was internally discovered by Intel.
- NetApp products do not ship with affected versions of the firmware but, for virtualized deployments, NetApp recommends working with your hypervisor and cloud platform vendors to ensure that your NetApp product is running on a secure and patched platform. For Docker-based deployments, NetApp recommends working with your operating system and hardware vendors to ensure that your NetApp product is running on a secure and patched platform.
