- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input validation in system firmware.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is present in the system firmware of Intel NUC kits. The firmware has insufficient input validation which allows an attacker to potentially elevate privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker can elevate privileges to System Management Mode (SMM).
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is local and requires a malicious user to execute code within the system to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be local and have the ability to execute code in order to exploit the vulnerability.
