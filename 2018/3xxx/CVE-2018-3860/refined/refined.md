- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from the parsing of a tiled TIFF image with a specially crafted resolution tag and data. An out-of-bounds write occurs when a user-influenced address is loaded and zeroed out, and then later used in the `DIB_resolution_set` function with the incorrect value.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the TIFF parsing functionality of Canvas Draw 4.0.0. Specifically, a crafted TIFF image can cause the `DIB_resolution_set` function to write to an arbitrary memory location.

- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution.

- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted TIFF image.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to deliver a malicious TIFF image to the application. The user must open the malicious TIFF file.
