# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2018-0544

## ACD Systems Canvas Draw 4 Resolution\_Set Out of Bounds Write Code Execution Vulnerability

##### July 19, 2018

##### CVE Number

CVE-2018-3860

### Summary

An exploitable out-of-bounds write exists in the TIFF parsing functionality of Canvas Draw version 4.0.0. A specially crafted TIFF image processed via the application can lead to an out-of-bounds write, overwriting arbitrary data. An attacker can deliver a TIFF image to trigger this vulnerability and gain the ability to execute code.

### Tested Versions

ACDSystems Canvas Draw 4.0.0

### Product URLs

<https://www.canvasgfx.com/en/products/canvas-draw>

### CVSSv3 Score

8.8 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-787: Out-of-Bounds Write

### Details

Canvas Draw 4 is a graphics editing tool used to create and edit images, as well as other graphic-related material. This product has a large user base and is popular in its specific field. The vulnerable component is in the handling of TIFF images. TIFF is a raster-based image format used in graphics editing projects, thus making it a very common file format for such an application.

The vulnerability arises in the parsing of a tiled TIFF image with a specially crafted resolution tag and data. The initial crash is shown below.

```
* thread #1: tid = 0xce123, 0x0000000101f68221 ImageGear18`DIB_resolution_set + 22, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=1, address=0x7fff00000008)
    frame #0: 0x0000000101f68221 ImageGear18`DIB_resolution_set + 22
ImageGear18`DIB_resolution_set:
->  0x101f68221 <+22>: mov    qword ptr [rdi + 0x8], rdx
    0x101f68225 <+26>: mov    qword ptr [rdi + 0x10], rax
    0x101f68229 <+30>: mov    eax, dword ptr [rsi + 0x8]
    0x101f6822c <+33>: mov    qword ptr [rdi + 0x18], rax

     [rdi: 0x00007fff00000000]

```

Following the backtrace, we can see that the value of RDI has been incorrectly calculated. The location which it is set is below.

```
__text:0000000114F26A13                 lea     rcx, [rbp+var_40]                 [0]
__text:0000000114F26A17                 lea     r8, [rbp+var_38]
__text:0000000114F26A1B                 lea     rbx, [rbp+var_70]
__text:0000000114F26A1F                 mov     edx, 1
__text:0000000114F26A24                 mov     r9, rbx
__text:0000000114F26A27                 call    _IG_info_get_FD_ex                 [1]
__text:0000000114F26A2C                 mov     rdi, [rbx]      ; th

```

The address in memory is loaded into RCX [0], and then passed into a get information function, [1]. Going a bit further, the vulnerability becomes apparent.

```
__text:0000000101E46E83                  mov     r14, [rbp+user_buffer]
__text:0000000101E46E8C                  mov     dword ptr [r13+0], 0
__text:0000000101E46E99                  mov     dword ptr [r14], 0             [2]

```

The user-influenced address is loaded into the R14 register and the lower four bytes are then zeroed out in memory. When this value is then used later in `DIB_resolution_set` above, it causes an out-of-bounds write and an exploitable condition to arise. By crafting a special TIFF image an attacker could exploit this situation to gain code execution.
