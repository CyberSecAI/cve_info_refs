Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a double free condition in the Hyland Perceptive Document Filters during the conversion of OpenDocument files to JPEG format. This occurs due to the `SkCanvas` object being deallocated twice.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Double Free:** The primary vulnerability is a double free error, specifically targeting the `SkCanvas` object.
- **Use-After-Free Potential:**  While not explicitly stated as a use-after-free, the double free allows an attacker to manipulate the heap, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution on the target system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious OpenDocument File:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious OpenDocument file that, when processed by the vulnerable Hyland software, triggers the double free.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Malicious File:** The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted OpenDocument file to the vulnerable software. This could be via email, web upload, or other means of file transfer.
- **No Authentication Required**: The vulnerability can be triggered without authentication. The attacker only needs the ability to provide an input to the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability is located in the `libISYSreadershd.so` library on both Windows and Linux systems.
- The double free occurs because the `SkCanvas` object's destructor is called twice, once in the `sub_F511F5F0` function and a second time in `ISYS_NS::CGdiCanvasImpl::~CGdiCanvasImpl`.
- The `SkCanvas` object is initially allocated in the `ISYS_NS::CGdiCanvasImpl::CGdiCanvasImpl` method.
- Exploitation can be achieved by manipulating the heap between the first and second deallocation of the `SkCanvas` object.

**Affected Versions:**
- Perceptive Document Filters 11.4.0.2647 on x86 and x64 Windows and Linux platforms.

**CVSS Score:**
- 8.8 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
