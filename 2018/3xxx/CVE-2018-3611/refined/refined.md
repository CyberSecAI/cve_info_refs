- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Intel Graphics driver fails to properly perform a bounds check, allowing access to temporarily disabled hardware.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient validation of hardware state in the Intel Graphics driver.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service (DoS)
- **Attack vectors:** Local access
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Unprivileged user access to the system. The user needs to trigger the driver functionality that accesses the disabled hardware.

The provided document gives more detail than the CVE description placeholder. It describes the vulnerability as a bounds check failure in the Intel Graphics Driver versions 15.40.x.4865 and 20.19.x.4865 (and possibly earlier), which allows an unprivileged user to cause a denial of service. The vulnerability affects specific Intel processors with Iris Pro Graphics 6200, Iris Graphics 6100, or HD Graphics 6000.
