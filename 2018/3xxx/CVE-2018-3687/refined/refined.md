The provided content is related to CVE-2018-3687.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from unquoted service paths within the Intel Quartus II Programmer and Tools. This allows for the potential replacement of legitimate executables used by the JTAG server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unquoted service paths: The JTAG server utilizes paths that are not enclosed in quotes when searching for executables.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege Escalation: A local attacker can replace the required executables. Upon reboot, these malicious executables could then be executed with the elevated privileges associated with the service, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access: The attacker needs local access to the system to replace the vulnerable executables.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local user account with the ability to write to system folders.
- Ability to replace or modify executable files used by the JTAG server.

**Affected Products:**
- Intel Quartus II Programmer and Tools v11.0 â€“ 15.0
