The provided content is related to CVE-2018-3914.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the `video-core` HTTP server of the Samsung SmartThings Hub.
- The `video-core` process insecurely extracts fields from the "shard" table of its SQLite database without proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Multiple `strcpy` calls copy database fields into stack-allocated buffers without validating the size of the data.
- Specifically, the `sessionToken` field, when retrieved from the "shard" table, is copied into a 2000-byte buffer on the stack using `strcpy`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can achieve code execution on the `video-core` process, which runs as root.
- This can lead to a complete compromise of the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can send an HTTP request to trigger the vulnerability.
- The vulnerable function is reachable via the `imageUploader` and `mp4Uploader` threads.
- HTTP requests are encapsulated within a persistent TLS connection established by the `hubCore` process and relayed to the `video-core` process.
- The HTTP server listens on port 3000 on localhost.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the localhost port 3000 of the SmartThings Hub. This can be done through the persistent TLS connection established by `hubCore`.
- The attacker needs to be able to modify the `sessionToken` field in the "shard" table of the database to trigger the overflow by sending a crafted HTTP request through the persistent TLS connection.
