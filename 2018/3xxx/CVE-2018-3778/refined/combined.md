# [SECURITY] Last will messages is not checked against authorization. #211

## Description

[![@mhverbakel](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11353785?v=4&size=48)](/mhverbakel)[mhverbakel](https://github.com/mhverbakel)opened [on Aug 6, 2018](https://github.com/moscajs/aedes/issues/211#issue-348007811)

The LWT is not checked for authorization.

Simple example:

```
const aedes = require('aedes')({ authorizePublish: (a, b, c) => c(new Error("Not allowed")) });
require('net').createServer(aedes.handle).listen(1883);
```

Now, from a client, connect and subscribe to "will".

From another client, connect with a last will message with topic "will". Then send a message to "test", breaking the connection (because of authorization failure).

Breaking the connection will trigger the LWT, and thus sends a message to "will", which can be seen in the other client.
