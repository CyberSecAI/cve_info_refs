Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-3778:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of authorization checks on Last Will and Testament (LWT) messages within the `aedes` MQTT broker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Authorization:** The `aedes` broker does not enforce its configured authorization rules when a client sets a Last Will message. This means that even if a client is not authorized to publish to a specific topic under normal circumstances, the broker will still publish a LWT message to that topic if the client's connection is broken unexpectedly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Message Publication:** A malicious client can bypass access control restrictions by crafting a LWT message with a specific topic and payload. When the malicious client's connection is severed (e.g. due to authorization failure), the broker will publish the crafted LWT message, potentially affecting other subscribers who are not expecting this message.
- **Information Leakage/Manipulation:** Depending on the LWT topic and payload, an attacker could either leak information to unauthorized subscribers or manipulate the state of the system by sending control messages via the LWT mechanism.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious MQTT client connects to the broker and specifies a Last Will message with a topic that it would normally not have authorization to publish to.
- The malicious client then takes actions that result in its connection being terminated (e.g. by sending an unauthorized message).
- Upon connection termination, the broker publishes the LWT message to the specified topic, bypassing the configured authorization checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to connect to the vulnerable MQTT broker.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft and send a valid LWT message.
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger a connection termination (either intentionally or unintentionally).
