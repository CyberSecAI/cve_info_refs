Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2018-3824:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in X-Pack Machine Learning.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*   Specifically, the vulnerability arises when an attacker can inject malicious data into an index being used by a Machine Learning job.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   If exploited, an attacker can obtain sensitive information from other ML users or perform destructive actions on their behalf. This occurs when another user views the results of the affected ML job.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector involves injecting malicious data into an index that is being processed by an ML job.
*   The malicious code is then executed when another user views the job results.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to inject data into an index that is being actively used by an ML job.
*   The attacker does not necessarily need direct access to the ML job itself, just the underlying data.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability affects all versions of X-Pack Machine Learning prior to the fixes released in Elasticsearch versions 6.2.4 and 5.6.9.
*   The vulnerability is identified as ESA-2018-08 by Elastic.

**Summary**
The document describes an XSS vulnerability in the X-Pack Machine Learning component of Elasticsearch. An attacker can inject malicious data into an index used by an ML job. This malicious data will be executed when another user views the results of this job in the system, enabling the attacker to potentially steal sensitive data or perform destructive actions.
