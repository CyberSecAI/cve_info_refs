The provided content is related to CVE-2018-3912 and describes multiple stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the Samsung SmartThings Hub's `video-core` HTTP server.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `video-core` process insecurely extracts fields from the "shard" table of its SQLite database, specifically using `strcpy` to copy data into fixed-size stack buffers without proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Multiple stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the function `sub_289D0`, which retrieves settings from the `shard` table. The vulnerabilities are triggered by the following fields:
- `secretKey` (128 bytes buffer)
- `accessKey` (32 bytes buffer)
- `sessionToken` (2000 bytes buffer)
- `bucket` (64 bytes buffer)
- `directory` (136 bytes buffer)
- `region` (16 bytes buffer)
The `strcpy` function is used to copy these fields into stack buffers which leads to overflows when the data from the database exceeds the buffer size.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the `video-core` process, which runs as root.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker can send a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/credentials` endpoint of the `video-core` HTTP server, which is listening on localhost port 3000, via the `hubCore` process. The malicious HTTP request should contain an excessively long value for one of the vulnerable fields in the `s3` parameters. The malicious values for the fields are inserted by an SQL injection in the `sInj` variable, into the sqlite database which is read by the vulnerable function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the `video-core` process via the `hubCore` process, which acts as a proxy. This implies the attacker needs to be able to establish a connection with the SmartThings hub. While not explicitly stated, this could imply the attacker needs to be on the same network as the SmartThings hub, or be able to communicate with the hub through a remote service. The HTTP server on port 3000 is only listening to localhost, thus the attacker needs to utilize the persistent TLS connection established by `hubCore` to relay the crafted HTTP request. The attacker needs to be able to send a `credentials` POST request with a crafted `s3` parameter containing an SQL injection in order to modify the content of the `shard` table.
