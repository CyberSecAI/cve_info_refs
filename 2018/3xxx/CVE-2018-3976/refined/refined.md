- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the parsing of the CALS Raster file format within Canvas Draw 5. Specifically, incorrect values in the CALS header related to image column and row sizes are not properly validated. This leads to out-of-bounds write attempts when accessing image data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain code execution by overwriting arbitrary data through out-of-bounds write.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can deliver a specially crafted CAL image to the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious CAL image to the vulnerable application and have the user open the file with the application.
