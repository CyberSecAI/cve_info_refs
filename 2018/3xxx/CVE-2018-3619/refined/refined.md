The content is related to CVE-2018-3619.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Intel Rapid Storage Technology (Intel RST) software migrates data during the Intel Optane memory enabling process. A small region on the non-Intel Optane memory module is kept hidden from the host operating system. If Microsoft BitLocker is enabled *after* configuring the Intel Optane memory device, this small hidden region will not be encrypted, potentially exposing user data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inadequate handling of data migration during Intel Optane memory configuration.
- Failure to encrypt a small region of the non-Optane memory when BitLocker is enabled after Optane configuration.
- Reliance on a specific order of operations (BitLocker enablement *before* Optane configuration) for whole disk encryption to be effective.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker with physical access to the system can potentially recover unencrypted data from the hidden region of the non-Optane memory module. This results in information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Physical access to the affected system is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs physical access to the system.
- No special privileges are mentioned, but physical access would allow for various attack vectors.

| **Root Cause** | Data migration during Intel Optane setup leaves a hidden region unencrypted when BitLocker is enabled after Optane configuration.                                                                                                 |
| **Vulnerability** |  A small region of the non-Optane drive is not encrypted if Bitlocker is enabled after the Intel Optane memory is configured.                                                                 |
| **Impact** |  Information disclosure; attacker can recover unencrypted data.                                                                                                                                                  |
