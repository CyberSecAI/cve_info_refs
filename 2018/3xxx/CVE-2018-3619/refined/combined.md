| Intel ID: | INTEL-SA-00114 |
| --- | --- |
| Product family: | Intel® Optane™ |

**Summary:**

Information disclosure vulnerability in storage media in systems with Intel® Optane™ memory module with Whole Disk Encryption may allow an attacker to recover data via physical access.

**Description:**

Intel identified an issue where some systems configured with Whole Disk Encryption and an Intel® Optane™ memory module, may be at risk of data remaining unencrypted and potentially accessible under specific conditions.

Microsoft\* BitLocker is required as the software-based Whole Disk Encryption solution on Intel® Optane™ memory enabled volumes.

Other software-based Whole Disk Encryption solutions are not supported.

Microsoft\* BitLocker should be enabled before configuring the Intel® Optane™ memory module. Data migration to the Intel® Optane™ memory module takes place using the Intel® Rapid Storage Technology (Intel® RST) software.

Due to how Intel® RST software migrates data during the Intel® Optane™ memory enabling process, there is a small region on the non-Intel® Optane™ memory module that will be kept hidden from the host operating system. If Microsoft\* BitLocker enablement occurs after configuring the Intel® Optane™ memory media device, this small region will not benefit from the Whole Disk Encryption and as a result, end-user data in the small region could possibly be at risk.

**Affected products:**

The issue potentially affects systems with Intel® Optane™ memory module and Microsoft\* BitLocker enabled, based on:

•       7th Gen Intel® Core™ Desktop Processors

•       8th Gen Intel® Core™ Desktop Processors

•       8th Gen Intel® Core™ Mobile Processors

•       Intel® Core™ X-Series Processors

•       Intel® Xeon® E Processors

**Affected configurations:**

          Intel® Optane™ Memory + Whole Disk Encryption

| **Configuration** | | **Potentially affected by CVE-2018-3619** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Intel® Optane™ Memory | SW based Whole Disk Encryption |
| Y | Y | Y |
| Y | N | N |
| N | Y | N |
| N | N | N |

| **CVE ID** | **CVE Title** | CVSSv3 severity | **CVSSv3 Vectors** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **CVE-2018-3619** | Information disclosure vulnerability in storage media in systems with Intel® Optane™ memory module with Whole Disk Encryption may allow an attacker to recover data via physical access | 5.3 (Moderate) | CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N |

**Recommendations:**

      1.     Intel requires users who want Whole Disk Encryption with Intel® Optane™ memory to use  Microsoft\* BitLocker. The use of other software Whole Disk Encryption solutions is not supported.

      2.     Enable Microsoft\* BitLocker **before** configuring the Intel® Optane™ memory device.

      3.   Intel requires following these steps to ensure the Intel® Optane™ memory with Microsoft\* BitLocker is configured properly:

* Confirm Microsoft\* BitLocker is ON. Check the Microsoft website for  instructions: <https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/969.how-to-determine-if-bitlocker-drive-encryption-is-enabled.aspx>
* Follow these steps to ensure your system is properly configured:

1.     Launch Intel® RST User Interface(UI)/Intel® Optane™ Memory UI

2.     Disable Intel® Optane™ memory

3.     Enable Intel® Optane™ memory again

§  Check the following link for detailed instructions to disable and enable Intel® Optane™ memory: <https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/memory-and-storage/optane-memory/intel-optane-memory-user-installation.pdf>

§  Refer to section 2.1.4 for disabling Intel® Optane™ and section 2.1.3 for enabling Intel® Optane™ using Intel® Optane™ Memory UI

§  Refer to section 2.2.2 for disabling Intel® Optane™ and section 2.2.1 for enabling Intel® Optane™ using Intel® Optane™ Memory UI

**Acknowledgements:**

CVE-2018-3619 was discovered by Intel.
