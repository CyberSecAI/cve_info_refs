The content is related to CVE-2018-3908.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `video-core` process incorrectly handles pipelined HTTP requests due to the lack of awareness of multiple HTTP requests over a single connection. Specifically, the `on_body` callback does not properly manage the buffer when parsing pipelined HTTP requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request Smuggling') - The `on_body` callback concatenates the body of subsequent requests to the same buffer, overwriting the content from previous requests.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can control the body of a request by sending a series of pipelined requests, where the body of the first request is overwritten by a subsequent request. This could allow an attacker to modify camera settings such as the URL.
- The vulnerability can be chained with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution or bypass authentication.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending crafted pipelined HTTP requests to the `video-core` process on port 3000.
- The attacker needs to establish a connection to the localhost of the device running `video-core`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the `video-core` process, listening on port 3000 of the localhost of the Samsung SmartThings Hub. This can be done by leveraging the persistent TLS connection established by `hubCore`.
