Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-3989:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `0x8200E804` IOCTL handler of the `WibuKey.sys` driver.
- A specially crafted IRP request can cause the driver to return uninitialized memory from kernel space to user space.
- Specifically, the issue stems from how the driver handles the `someSize` variable and copies data into the output buffer. The driver copies the amount of data specified by someSize variable without clearing/initializing `allocatedBuffer`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Kernel Memory Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the leakage of kernel memory to user-space due to the driver's failure to properly initialize a buffer before copying it to the user-provided output buffer.
- **Uninitialized Memory Usage:** The driver copies uninitialized memory to an output buffer, which can reveal sensitive information present in the kernel.
- **Lack of Bounds Checking:** The driver does not validate if the copied data has been initialized or not. It only checks if the size of data to be copied is less or equal to the output buffer size.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially read sensitive information from kernel memory, such as passwords, cryptographic keys, or other confidential data, which could be used to further compromise the system.
- The leaked memory can also potentially be used in other exploits such as bypassing KASLR.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attack is performed locally by sending a specially crafted IRP request to the `\Device\WibuKey` device. The access control lists (ACLs) for the device allow any user on the system to send IOCTL requests, which lowers the bar for exploitation.
- **IOCTL Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a specific IOCTL code (`0x8200E804`) sent to the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system with the vulnerable driver installed.
- **Ability to Send IOCTLs:** The attacker needs the capability to send IOCTL requests to the WibuKey device, which, based on the report, any user on the system can do.
- **Knowledge of IOCTL and Input Structure:** An attacker needs to understand the structure of the IOCTL and its input parameters to craft the specific request to trigger the memory disclosure.
