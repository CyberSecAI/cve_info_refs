Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-3665:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how some Intel x86 processors handle speculative execution in conjunction with the "lazy FPU" (Floating-Point Unit) feature. When "lazy FPU" is enabled, processors might speculatively read floating-point and vector registers even if access to those registers is disabled. This happens because the kernel's "lazy FPU" optimization relies on access controls to avoid saving and restoring these registers for tasks that don't utilize them. Specifically, the vulnerability is observed in processors with "Nehalem" and "Westmere" core designs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Speculative Execution Side Channel:** The vulnerability is a speculative execution side-channel issue, where the processor speculatively executes instructions and the side effects are observable, even if the speculative execution is later discarded.
*   **Flawed Lazy FPU Implementation:** The Linux kernel's implementation of "lazy FPU" relies on access controls to prevent unauthorized access to floating-point registers. This assumption breaks down when speculative execution is involved.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker controlling an unprivileged process, if "lazy FPU" is enabled on a vulnerable processor, can potentially read sensitive data from other users' processes or the kernel. This could include floating-point data and potentially cryptographic keys, especially when AES-NI is present.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Unprivileged Access:** An unprivileged user with local access to the affected system is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to execute code on the affected system.
*   No special privileges are needed for the exploit.
*   The target system must have a vulnerable Intel x86 processor with "lazy FPU" enabled.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is mitigated by disabling "lazy FPU" by default on all affected x86 processors.
*   A kernel parameter `eagerfpu=on` can also be used for mitigation by forcing the processor to eagerly save and restore the FPU registers.
*   The vulnerability specifically affects Intel x86 processors with "Nehalem" and "Westmere" core designs.
*   The fix involves switching from lazy FPU state restore to eager FPU state restore.

The content from netapp indicates that it can be exploited on their systems if the specified affected products are used, the impact is the disclosure of sensitive information, and they address the vulnerability in the specified fixed versions, or note that they do not plan to address the vulnerability. Palo Alto indicates that the vulnerability affects their WildFire appliance, and the exploit leads to reads from a compromised VM to retrieve data from other VMs, and provides mitigation through software updates. FreeBSD provides the mitigation by switching from lazy FPU to Eager FPU state restore. The Red Hat content highlights that the vulnerability allows a local unprivileged user to read the FPU state of other processes and provides mitigation by defaulting to eager FPU restore on newer intel processors, as well as providing an option to enable the feature on older ones.
