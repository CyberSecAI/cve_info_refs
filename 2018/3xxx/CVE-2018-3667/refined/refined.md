- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Intel Processor Diagnostic Tool (IPDT) installer v4.1.0.24 installs three files with improper permissions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper file permissions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution and escalation of privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploiting the improperly set permissions during the installation process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to interact with the installation process and potentially have local access to the system. User interaction is required (UI:R). The CVSS score indicates that a low privileged attacker can escalate to SYSTEM.
