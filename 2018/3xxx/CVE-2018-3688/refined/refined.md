The provided document contains information about multiple CVEs, including CVE-2018-3688.

**CVE-2018-3688:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Unquoted service paths in the IntelÂ® Quartus Prime Programmer and Tools allows a local attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code. Specifically, the Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) server is vulnerable to replacement of required executables.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unquoted service paths in the Intel Quartus Prime Programmer and Tools, specifically affecting the JTAG server. This allows for the replacement of executables that are run with elevated privileges on reboot.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**  Local privilege escalation. An attacker could execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges by replacing the JTAG server's executables.
*   **Attack vectors:**  A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to modify files on the local system.
