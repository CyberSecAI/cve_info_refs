The provided content is a detailed vulnerability report for CVE-2018-3982, providing more detail than the official CVE description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of array indices when parsing Word documents in the Atlantis word processor. Specifically, the application uses an out-of-bounds index to access an array, which can lead to reading arbitrary data as a pointer. Later, it attempts to write to this pointer, causing an arbitrary write.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Heap-based buffer overflow:** Occurs when writing a new character position outside the bounds of the CLX array due to its size being smaller than a multiple of the size of each individual element.
- **Improper validation of array index (CWE-129):** The application incorrectly checks that an index is not larger than the number of elements described by the `PlcfendTxt`, while it should be checked against the number of `PlcfendRef` elements. This leads to an out-of-bounds access.
- **Arbitrary write:** The out-of-bounds read results in an invalid pointer being used for a write operation, leading to an arbitrary write.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** By corrupting memory through the arbitrary write, an attacker can gain the ability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Atlantis word processor.
- **Memory corruption:** The heap-based buffer overflow and arbitrary write lead to memory corruption, which can further lead to application instability or exploitation.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Document parsing:** The vulnerability is triggered by parsing a specially crafted Word document.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **File creation:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious Word document with specific characteristics to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker must convince a victim to open the crafted document using the vulnerable Atlantis word processor.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs during the parsing of the `PlcfFldEdn` field in the Word document's `Fib` structure, specifically within the `PlcfEndRef` and `PlcfendTxt` lists.
- The `Fib` structure contains a CLX array which is used to parse pieces of text.
- The vulnerability arises because a size check uses the wrong `Plc` field. The `PlcfendTxt` is used to validate the size, instead of `PlcfendRef`. This enables the application to use an out of bounds index into the `PlcfendRef` array.
- When parsing the `PlcfFldEdn`, the application does not properly validate the index against the size of the `PlcfendRef` array, instead it uses the size from `PlcfendTxt`.
- The out-of-bounds access in the `TList` results in reading arbitrary memory as a pointer, which is then used for a write operation.
- The application attempts to write a pointer to this arbitrary address, leading to an access violation.
