Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-3828:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Certain exception conditions in Elastic Cloud Enterprise (ECE) versions prior to 1.1.4 would result in encryption keys, passwords, and other security-sensitive headers being leaked to the allocator logs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Information exposure due to improper handling of exceptions, leading to sensitive data leakage in logs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker with access to the logging cluster could obtain leaked credentials. This would allow the attacker to perform authenticated actions using these credentials, potentially gaining unauthorized access to resources and data within the ECE environment.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker needs access to the logging cluster where ECE logs are stored.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must have access to the logging cluster used by ECE. This could mean the attacker already has some level of access to the ECE infrastructure.

**Summary:**
CVE-2018-3828 is an information disclosure vulnerability in Elastic Cloud Enterprise (ECE).  Sensitive information such as encryption keys and passwords could be exposed in allocator logs due to unhandled exceptions. This information could be used by an attacker with access to these logs to gain unauthorized access to other parts of the system.
