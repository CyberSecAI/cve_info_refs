- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of XML input, specifically the lack of restriction on XML External Entity (XXE) references.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** XML External Entity (XXE) Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially achieve data compromise by exploiting the XXE vulnerability. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to read local files, potentially leading to sensitive data exposure.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted XML payload to the `/emm/_cros_/xlogin.asp` endpoint or other endpoints accepting XML input via HTTP POST requests. The attacker needs to control the XML payload sent to the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be unauthenticated and needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. The attacker needs the ability to host an external resource to be included by the server through the XXE attack.
