- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stack-based buffer overflow in the `video-core` process of the Samsung SmartThings Hub when retrieving database fields from the "shard" table.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `video-core` process uses `strcpy` to copy database field values into a structure on the stack without proper bounds checking. This allows an attacker to overflow the destination buffer by providing an overly long input string for several database fields.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Code execution on the `video-core` process, which runs as root.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to the `video-core` HTTP server, which is listening on localhost port 3000. The `hubCore` process relays messages from remote SmartThings servers via a persistent TLS connection to this server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the `video-core` server. This can be done through a Man-in-The-Middle attack on the TLS connection between the hub and the SmartThings servers or through a separate vulnerability (TALOS-2018-0556). The attacker also needs to know how to format a malicious HTTP request to trigger the overflow in the specific `strcpy` call.

This report provides details for multiple CVEs (CVE-2018-3912, CVE-2018-3913, CVE-2018-3914, CVE-2018-3915, CVE-2018-3916, CVE-2018-3917). The specific vulnerability for CVE-2018-3916 is a stack-based buffer overflow when retrieving the `directory` field from the "shard" table, where the destination buffer has a size of 136 bytes.
The report also provides proof of concept exploits for each CVE, which involves crafting malicious SQL injection within the HTTP request to update the fields in the `shard` table.
