  "CVE-2018-3837": {
    "Description": "An exploitable information disclosure vulnerability exists in the PCX image rendering functionality of Simple DirectMedia Layer SDL2_image-2.0.2. A specially crafted PCX image can cause an out-of-bounds read on the heap, resulting in information disclosure. An attacker can display a specially crafted image to trigger this vulnerability.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper bounds checking when de-interlacing PCX image data. The width of the image is calculated based on the `Xmax` and `Xmin` values in the PCX header, while the buffer size for processing the image data is calculated using `BytesPerLine`. If `width` is greater than `BytesPerLine`, the de-interlacing process will read out of bounds.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Lack of input validation",
      "Improper buffer size calculation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Information disclosure. An attacker can read data from the heap by providing a specially crafted PCX image which leads to the SDL_surface.pixel buffer containing heap data.",
    "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted PCX image file needs to be opened and processed by a vulnerable application using the SDL2_image library.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious PCX file to the vulnerable application for processing.  User interaction is required to open the file.",
      "Affected products": [
        "StarWind VSAN for vSphere build 12533",
        "StarWind VSAN for vSphere build 12658",
