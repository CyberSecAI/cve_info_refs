  "vulnerability_1": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2018-3981",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises in the parsing of a tiled TIFF image with a specially crafted resolution tag and data. A user-influenced address is loaded into the R14 register and the lower four bytes are then zeroed out in memory. When this value is then used later in `DIB_resolution_set`, it causes an out-of-bounds write.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could exploit this situation to gain code execution by crafting a special TIFF image.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A specially crafted TIFF image processed via the application can lead to an out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to deliver a malicious TIFF image to the victim and convince them to open it."
  },
  "vulnerability_2": {
        "cve_id": "CVE-2018-3983",
        "root_cause": "The application uses an uninitialized pointer when parsing a Word document. Specifically, a TList containing TTableRow objects is left empty due to a missing or corrupted property. When the application later attempts to initialize the first element of this empty list, it results in writing to an uninitialized pointer.",
        "weaknesses": [
            "Uninitialized pointer",
            "Heap-based buffer overflow"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker can corrupt heap memory leading to code execution under the context of the application.",
