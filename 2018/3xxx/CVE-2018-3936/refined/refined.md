- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `GetShapePropery` function of the Antenna House Office Server Document Converter when processing a crafted Microsoft Word (DOC) document. Specifically, the function reads a record length value from the document and then reads that many bytes into a fixed-size buffer on the stack without proper size validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is a classic stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121). The code reads a record length from the input document and uses this value without checking against the size of a local buffer, `localBuffer` (fixed size of 0x208 bytes). This leads to writing outside the buffer boundary on the stack.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to overwrite the return address on the stack. This enables remote code execution, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server where the document converter is running.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves a specially crafted Microsoft Word document. This document, when converted using the vulnerable software, triggers the buffer overflow in the `GetShapePropery` function during the conversion process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to provide a malformed Microsoft Word document to the vulnerable application. This implies the attacker can induce the server to convert this document through an interface or service using the vulnerable software.
