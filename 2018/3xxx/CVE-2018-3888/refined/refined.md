The provided content is a vulnerability report for CVE-2018-3888.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the PCX image parsing functionality of Computerinsel Photoline, specifically in the decompression of the color map using run-length encoding. The program incorrectly calculates the size of compressed data, leading to an out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds write due to incorrect size calculation during PCX color map decompression.
- User-controlled data influencing the size of the write, allowing for arbitrary data overwrite.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Code execution. An attacker can overwrite arbitrary data leading to the execution of malicious code.

**Attack vectors:**
- Delivering a specially crafted PCX image to the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious PCX image file.
- The user must open the crafted PCX file with the vulnerable application.
