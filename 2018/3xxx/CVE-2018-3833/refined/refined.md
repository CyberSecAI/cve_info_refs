Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2018-3833:

**Vulnerability 1: Firmware Downgrade Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** The Insteon Hub firmware update process, triggered via PubNub, fetches firmware binaries over plain HTTP without verifying the firmware version being installed, allowing downgrades.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Plain HTTP:** Firmware is downloaded using insecure HTTP, susceptible to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.
    *   **Lack of Version Checking:** The device doesn't check if the new firmware version is higher than the current one, which allows for downgrading to older, potentially vulnerable versions.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can force a downgrade to a previous firmware version with known vulnerabilities, enabling further attacks.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker needs to impersonate the remote server "cache.insteon.com" and serve a chosen signed firmware image.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and modify network traffic, effectively performing a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack.

**Vulnerability 2: Arbitrary Firmware Upload via MPFS**

*   **Root Cause:** The Insteon Hub exposes an MPFS (Microchip Proprietary File System) upload feature that can be exploited to upload arbitrary firmware without signature checks.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Enabled MPFS Upload:** The `/mpfsupload` endpoint is enabled, which allows an attacker to upload a custom MPFS image.
    *   **Lack of Signature Checks:** The firmware update process, accessible via a crafted MPFS image, does not perform any signature checks on the uploaded firmware, enabling the upload of arbitrary code.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can upload and execute malicious firmware on the device, gaining full control.
    *   **Persistent Modification:** The attacker can write persistent code, altering the device's behavior permanently.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker uploads a modified MPFS image to the device via the `/mpfsupload` endpoint, then sends a POST request to `firmware.htm` which triggers the unsigned firmware update.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Insteon Hub and valid credentials for basic authentication to use the `/mpfsupload` and `firmware.htm` endpoints.

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   The Insteon Hub uses a Microchip PIC32MX MCU with a MIPS32 architecture.
*   The firmware is based on Microchipâ€™s "Libraries for Applications."
*   The device uses PubNub for remote communication.
*   The MPFS upload functionality is part of the Microchip's `HTTPServer` library, but was not disabled by Insteon.
*   The "firmware.htm" endpoint used for the unsigned firmware update is not present by default and only becomes accessible after a modified MPFS image is uploaded.
