Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2018-3955:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper filtering of data passed to and retrieved from NVRAM (Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory) in Linksys ESeries routers. Specifically, user-supplied input for the 'Domain Name' field, submitted as the `wan_domain` POST parameter, is stored in NVRAM without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **OS Command Injection:** The `wan_domain` parameter, after being stored in NVRAM, is later retrieved by the `preinit` binary. This retrieved value is incorporated into a system command using `snprintf` and then executed via `system()`. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands.
*   **Improper Input Handling:** The router fails to sanitize user-provided input before storing it in NVRAM and subsequently using it in system commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** By injecting malicious commands into the `wan_domain` parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the router with root privileges.
*   **Full Control of the Device:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to gain full control of the router, potentially enabling further malicious activities, such as network manipulation, data theft, or using the device in a botnet.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Authenticated HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specifically crafted, authenticated HTTP POST request to the `apply.cgi` page of the router's web interface. The request needs to include the `wan_domain` parameter with the malicious command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs valid administrator credentials for the router's web interface to send the crafted POST request.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the router's web interface, typically via the local network or through a publicly exposed port if remote administration is enabled.

**Technical Details:**

*   The `apply.cgi` script handles the POST request and calls `get_cgi` to process the parameters. The `get_cgi` function places the parameters directly into NVRAM using `set_nvram`.
*   The `preinit` binary is responsible for restarting system services after configuration changes, triggered by a SIGHUP signal. It calls `nvram_get` to retrieve values from NVRAM.
*   The vulnerable code is within the `set_host_domain_name` function in the `libshared.so` shared object, where it retrieves the `wan_domain` value using `nvram_get` and then uses it in a `system()` call after processing it with `snprintf`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates how to exploit this vulnerability using `wan_domain` and how to gain telnet access to the device.
*   The vulnerability is also present in other parameters such as `machine_name` which are addressed by CVE-2018-3953 and CVE-2018-3954
