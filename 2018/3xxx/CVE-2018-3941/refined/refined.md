        "root_cause": "An exploitable use-after-free vulnerability exists in the JavaScript engine of Foxit Softwareâ€™s Foxit PDF Reader. When executing embedded JavaScript code, a document can be closed, which essentially frees a lot of used objects, but the JavaScript can continue to execute. Invoking a method which keeps a stale reference to a now-freed object can lead to a use-after-free condition.",

          "A specially crafted PDF document can trigger a previously freed object in memory to be reused, resulting in arbitrary code execution. An attacker needs to trick the user to open the malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.",
