Based on the provided commit, the following information is relevant to a security vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The commit message "fix security vulnerability" and the changes in `index.js` strongly suggest the presence of a directory traversal vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Directory traversal:** The code was vulnerable to directory traversal attacks. Before the fix, it did not properly validate the requested path, allowing access to files outside the intended directory (`self.dir`).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary file access:** By crafting a malicious path (e.g., using `..` sequences), an attacker could potentially access and retrieve sensitive files from the server's filesystem.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious HTTP GET requests:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted HTTP GET requests with a path that attempts to traverse outside the designated directory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of the server's file system structure:** While not strictly necessary, knowledge of the file system structure would allow the attacker to target specific files.
