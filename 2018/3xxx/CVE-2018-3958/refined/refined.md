  "CVE-2018-3958": {
    "description": "A use-after-free condition can occur when accessing the `Subject` property of the `this.info` object. The following code demonstrates this:\n\n```\nfunction main() {\nvar tmp = this.info;\napp.activeDocs[0].closeDoc();\ntmp[\"Subject\"] = \"\";\n}\nmain();\n```\n",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in accessing saved references to certain properties of `this.info` object, which can trigger a use-after-free condition. When executing embedded JavaScript code, a document can be closed, which essentially frees a lot of used objects, but the JavaScript can continue to run. Direct access to a now-freed object can lead to a use-after-free condition.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-416: Use After Free"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution. If the freed memory location is placed under attacker control, a double dereference could lead to control over contents of `edx` which is used in a `call` instruction, thus leading to arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A specially crafted PDF document can trigger the vulnerability.",
      "If the browser plugin extension is enabled, visiting a malicious site can also trigger the vulnerability."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to trick the user to open the malicious file to trigger this vulnerability."
