Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-3082:

**CVE-2018-3082**

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies within the Data Definition Language (DDL) processing of the MySQL server.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability is related to how the MySQL server handles DDL statements.
* **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, potentially causing the MySQL server to crash or become unavailable.
* **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, targeting the MySQL server via the MySQL protocol, and requires an authenticated connection.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must have a valid user with privileges to execute DDL statements against the MySQL server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The NetApp advisory (NTAP-20180726-0002) also lists this CVE and confirms the same vulnerability details as the Oracle advisory.
*   The NetApp advisory notes that multiple NetApp products incorporate vulnerable versions of Oracle MySQL and are therefore susceptible to this vulnerability, along with many others listed, from the July 2018 Oracle Critical Patch Update.
*   Both advisories emphasize the need to apply patches promptly.

This vulnerability is a moderate concern because it does not allow for confidentiality or integrity compromise, but only availability; however, an authenticated user is required to initiate the attack.

This information is more detailed than the official CVE description, as it specifies the vulnerable component (DDL processing), the type of attack (DoS), and required attacker privileges, which are not explicitly included in the general CVE description.
