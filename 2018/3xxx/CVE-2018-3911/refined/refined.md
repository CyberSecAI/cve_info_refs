- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `hubCore` process on the Samsung SmartThings Hub forwards HTTP requests to remote SmartThings servers and then to the `video-core` process. The remote servers are vulnerable to HTTP header injection when constructing an HTTP request based on JSON data. Specifically, the server does not properly sanitize `camera-id` field in the JSON data which can contain CRLF sequences.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - HTTP Header Injection (CWE-113): The remote server fails to sanitize CRLF sequences in the `camera-id` field of a JSON message, leading to the possibility of injecting arbitrary HTTP headers.
    - Unauthenticated access: The `hubCore` process listens on port 39500 (bound to “0.0.0.0”), allowing unauthenticated access to the service from anyone on the network.
    -  Improper input validation: The `hubCore` process forwards the crafted HTTP request to `video-core` without sanitizing it.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    -  An attacker can inject malicious headers into HTTP requests sent to the `video-core` process.
    -  By injecting CRLF sequences, the attacker can send pipelined HTTP requests, which can be further exploited using TALOS-2018-0577 to achieve an arbitrary code execution from the network, without authentication, as stated by the report.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the `hubCore` process on port 39500. The JSON payload contains a `cameraIds` field that includes CRLF sequences.
    - The injected CRLF sequence allows an attacker to inject pipelined HTTP requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be on the same network as the Samsung SmartThings Hub.
    - The attacker does not need any prior authentication.
