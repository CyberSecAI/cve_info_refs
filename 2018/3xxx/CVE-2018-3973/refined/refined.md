The provided content is related to CVE-2018-3973.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the parsing of malformed CAL image data within the ACD Systems Canvas Draw application. Specifically, the `realloc` function is used with attacker-controlled size parameters derived from the image data. This allows for the allocation of undersized memory buffers. Subsequent attempts to access image data beyond the allocated buffer boundaries trigger an out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds write vulnerability due to insufficient size checking during memory allocation and data manipulation.
- Improper handling of malformed CAL image data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Overwriting arbitrary data on the stack, potentially leading to code execution.
- Application crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- Processing a specially crafted PCX image file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted PCX image file to the vulnerable application.
- No special privileges are required beyond being able to open an image in the application.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `FillSpan` function of the `ImageGear18` library.
- The crash log details the stack trace during a crash, including the `_platform_bzero`, `IGRaster::FillSpan`, and other relevant library calls.
