The provided content is a commit diff for the `defaults-deep` repository, specifically addressing the exclusion of the `__proto__` property during deep merging. This directly relates to CVE-2018-3723.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper handling of the `__proto__` property during deep merging of objects. This allows an attacker to potentially inject properties into the prototype of `Object.prototype` or other objects, leading to unexpected behavior and potential security issues.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Prototype Pollution:** The vulnerability allows for modifying the `__proto__` property, which can lead to prototype pollution. This can lead to adding properties on every JavaScript object via `Object.prototype`.
- **Uncontrolled Object Modification:** The deep merge function would previously take all properties, including `__proto__`, from source objects and attempt to merge them into the target object. Without validation of property keys, this allows the user to modify properties beyond the target object.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By modifying the prototype of core JavaScript objects, an attacker could cause unexpected errors or crashes, resulting in a denial of service.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By carefully crafting the prototype pollution payload, an attacker might be able to execute arbitrary code within the context of the application.
- **Data tampering:** An attacker could modify object's prototype properties to change behavior or modify data within the application.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Malicious Input:** An attacker could supply a crafted object with a `__proto__` property, which when passed to the `defaultsDeep` function, would be used to modify the prototype of other objects.
- **Supply Chain:** The vulnerability could be introduced through a compromised dependency or by an attacker directly modifying the code of the library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- An attacker must be able to influence the input to the `defaultsDeep` function.
- The attacker must be able to pass a property named `__proto__`.

**More details than CVE description:**

The commit message `exclude __proto__` and the code diff clearly show that the fix involves explicitly checking for the `__proto__` key and skipping it during the merge operation. This prevents prototype pollution by ensuring that the `__proto__` property of the source object isn't copied into the target object. The code diff provides more insight than a typical CVE description by showing the specific lines of code that were added to fix the issue.
