CVE-2018-3984: Atlantis Word Processor Word document paragraph property (0xD608) sprmTDefTable uninitialized length code execution vulnerability

Summary:
An exploitable uninitialized length vulnerability exists within the Word document-parser of the Atlantis Word Processor. A specially crafted document can cause Atlantis to skip initializing a value representing the number of columns of a table. Later, the application will use this as a length within a loop that will write to a pointer on the heap, leading to a buffer overflow and code execution.

Affected Versions:
Atlantis Word Processor 3.0.2.3
Atlantis Word Processor 3.0.2.5

Root Cause:
The vulnerability lies in how Atlantis parses Microsoft Word Binary Documents. Specifically, the `sprmTDefTable` property, which defines table properties including the number of columns, isn't properly initialized in certain cases. This leads to an uninitialized value being used as a length in a loop.

Vulnerability:
- Uninitialized Value: The number of columns for a table is not initialized.
- Heap-based Buffer Overflow: The uninitialized value is then used as the length of a loop. Inside the loop, the code uses the length value to calculate the index of an array of pointers, resulting in an out-of-bounds write to the heap when the number of loop iterations exceeds the bounds of the `TTableRow` object.

Attack vector:
The attack vector is a specially crafted Word document. An attacker must convince a victim to open a malicious document to trigger the vulnerability.

Impact:
Successful exploitation can lead to code execution under the context of the application. An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution.

Exploit Details:
1. The application parses a Word document and identifies the "WordDocument" stream.
2. The application reads the Fib (File Information Block) from the stream's header.
3. The application determines which stream contains table information ("1Table" or "0Table").
4. The application parses the CLX array to identify document sections and apply properties.
5. The `sprmTDefTable` property is not parsed, leaving the corresponding index in the Sprm array uninitialized (0x80000000).
6. The application processes tables and constructs a `TTableRow` object.
7. The uninitialized length from the property array is read and stored in the `TTableRow` data.
8. The application enters a loop based on the uninitialized (very large) length.
9. Inside the loop, an out-of-bounds pointer is calculated due to the large length, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow when writing to this pointer.

Attacker Capabilities:
The attacker needs to create a malicious Word document and trick the user into opening it with the vulnerable Atlantis Word Processor.
