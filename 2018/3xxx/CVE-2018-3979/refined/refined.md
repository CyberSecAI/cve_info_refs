- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A specially crafted pixel shader in the Nouveau display driver causes excessive resource consumption when executed on the GPU, leading to a denial of service.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) in the GPU shader execution within the Nouveau display driver. The driver does not properly handle the execution of the malicious shader, leading to a resource exhaustion.

- **Impact of exploitation**: The system freezes and becomes unusable, requiring a manual reboot. This leads to a denial-of-service condition.

- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by providing a specially crafted website containing the malicious pixel shader. When a user visits the website using a vulnerable browser, the shader is executed by the Nouveau display driver, triggering the denial-of-service.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to host a webpage that will be visited by a target user with the vulnerable driver. The user needs to be running a vulnerable version of the Nouveau display driver.
