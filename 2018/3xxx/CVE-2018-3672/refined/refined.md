- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the driver module of Intel Smart Sound Technology which allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code as administrator through system calls.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of system calls within the Intel Smart Sound Technology driver module.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution with administrator privileges. This can result in complete system compromise, including data theft, malware installation, and system manipulation.
- **Attack vectors:** Local attacker access is required for exploitation. The vulnerability is triggered through the use of specific system calls.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the vulnerable system. The attacker also needs to be able to trigger the specific vulnerable system call within the driver. User interaction is required as indicated by the CVSS vector (UI:R).
