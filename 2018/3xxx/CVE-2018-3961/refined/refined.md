{
  "CVE-2018-3961": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in accessing saved references to certain properties of the `this.info` object after the document has been closed, leading to a use-after-free condition.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Use-After-Free"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could achieve arbitrary code execution by controlling the memory location pointed to by `ecx` and causing a double dereference that allows control of `edx`, used in a call instruction.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "A specially crafted PDF document that contains malicious JavaScript code."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick the user to open the malicious PDF file, or if the browser plugin extension is enabled, a malicious website can trigger the vulnerability. High privileges aren't required to trigger this specific vulnerability."
