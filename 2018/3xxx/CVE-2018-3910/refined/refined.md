- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Yi Home Camera's cloudAPI binary uses the `popen` function to execute a command that includes the SSID of the Wi-Fi network the camera is connecting to. The SSID value is not sanitized, allowing for command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** OS Command Injection (CWE-78).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution on the affected device. An attacker could potentially gain full control of the camera.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - An attacker can set up a malicious Wi-Fi network with a specially crafted SSID and trick a user into connecting their camera to it.
    - An attacker can connect their own camera to a specially crafted SSID.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to either create a Wi-Fi network with a malicious SSID or convince a user to connect their camera to such a network.
