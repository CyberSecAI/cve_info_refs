Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2018-3655:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A vulnerability exists in a subsystem within Intel CSME, Intel Server Platform Services, and Intel Trusted Execution Engine (TXE) firmware. Specifically, this flaw is present in Intel CSME versions prior to 11.21.55, Intel Server Platform Services versions prior to 4.0, and Intel TXE versions prior to 3.1.55.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is a lack of sufficient protection against unauthorized access via physical means. Specifically the vulnerability allows bypassing Intel CSME anti-replay protection. This allows an unauthenticated user with physical access to potentially:
*   Bypass Intel CSME anti-replay protection, which may allow brute force attacks to expose information stored inside the Intel CSME.
*   Gain unauthorized access to the Intel MEBX password.
*   Tamper with the integrity of the Intel CSME file system directories or the Server Platform Services and Trusted Execution Environment (Intel TXE) data files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to:
*   Disclosure of sensitive information
*   Modification of data/files
*   Privilege escalation

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector for this vulnerability is **physical access** to the affected system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs **physical access** to the system. No prior authentication is required.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is present in Intel CSME, Intel Server Platform Services, and Intel TXE firmware.
* The NetApp advisory indicates that NetApp Cloud Backup and NetApp SteelStore Cloud Integrated Storage are affected, and have no plans to release a fix due to their EOA (End of Availability).
* The Intel advisory also mentions CVE-2018-12147, but this CVE is different from the one being analyzed.
* The Intel advisory notes that mitigations for older vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-5705, CVE-2017-5706, CVE-2017-5707) are not sufficient, as an attacker can roll back to an earlier version affected by those CVEs.
