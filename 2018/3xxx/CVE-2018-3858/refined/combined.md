# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2018-0542

## ACD Systems Canvas Draw 4 PlanarConfiguration Heap Overflow Code Execution Vulnerability

##### July 19, 2018

##### CVE Number

CVE-2018-3858

### Summary

An exploitable heap overflow exists in the TIFF parsing functionality of Canvas Draw version 4.0.0. A specially crafted TIFF image processed via the application can lead to an out-of-bounds write, overwriting arbitrary data. An attacker can deliver a TIFF image to trigger this vulnerability and gain the ability to execute code.

### Tested Versions

ACDSystems Canvas Draw 4.0.0

### Product URLs

<https://www.canvasgfx.com/en/products/canvas-draw>

### CVSSv3 Score

8.8 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-122: Heap-Based Buffer Overflow

### Details

Canvas Draw 4 is a graphics editing tool used to create and edit images, as well as other graphic-related material. This product has a large user base, and is popular in its specific field. The vulnerable component is in the handling of TIFF images. TIFF is a raster-based image format used in graphics editing projects, thus making it a very common file format for such an application.

The vulnerability arises in the parsing of a tiled TIFF image with the PlanarConfiguration tag set. TIFF has two distinct ways for dealing with PlanarConfiguration, and by setting this tag to the default chunky version, i.e. stored contiguously with a tiled image, the application is thrown into a special parsing loop. Running the application with the vulnerable TIFF image and Guard Malloc, we get the crash below.

```
   Process 43138 stopped
* thread #1: tid = 0x814c5, 0x0000000101f6cbe8 ImageGear18`IGRaster::PlanarPackedToStd(long long, long long, long long, long long, unsigned char const*, void*, long long) + 248, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=1, address=0x3d05d0000)
    frame #0: 0x0000000101f6cbe8 ImageGear18`IGRaster::PlanarPackedToStd(long long, long long, long long, long long, unsigned char const*, void*, long long) + 248
ImageGear18`IGRaster::PlanarPackedToStd:
->  0x101f6cbe8 <+248>: mov    byte ptr [r10], r8b
    0x101f6cbeb <+251>: add    ecx, eax
    0x101f6cbed <+253>: add    r10, rdi
    0x101f6cbf0 <+256>: dec    r9

```

As can be seen above, the application is processing the planar packed information. If we look to where the buffer in R10 comes from, we can see the size being used for allocation. The malloc log for R10 is below.

```
ALLOC 0x3c704eff0-0x3c704eff7 [size=8]: TIF_read | _TIF_read | _TIF_Load_Uncompressed | _TIF_Load_Uncompressed_subs | AF_memm_alloc | malloc

```

And the area where this is calculated inside of `_TIF_Load_Uncompressed_subs`.

```
 call    _IO_raster_size_get
 mov     [rbp+var_50], rax
 mov     r12d, eax
 lea     rdx, aApplicationsBu_178 ; "/Applications/buildAgent/work/90a7e357b"...
 mov     edi, r13d
 mov     rsi, r12
 mov     ecx, 1796h
 call    _AF_memm_alloc

```

The raster size of this image is returned, then passed into a malloc wrapper, returning a properly allocated buffer. The problem arises when using the buffer inside of `PlanarPackedToStd`, the counter for the loop is miscalculated, and the overflow occurs. The relevant code is shown below.

```
mov     eax, 8
mov     r12,eax            [0]
mov     rax, r15           [1]
cqo
idiv    r12
mov     [rbp+var_30], rax  [2]

```

The above code calculates the loop counter for how many planars to unpack. At [0], eight is set as the value used for the size of the planar. Then, R15 is directly passed in and is too large a value. This causes the loop counter to be written as four, and causes the buffer to be overflowed. Below is the use of the counter variable and the vulnerable buffer to cause the overflow.

```
    do
    {
     ...
        do
        {
          *vuln_buffer = data & (mem >> data_calc);
          vuln_buffer = &vuln_buffer[inc_1];       [1]
          --v22;
          ++inc_1;
        }
        while ( v22 );
      }
      ++count;
    }
    while ( count != vuln_counter );               [2]

```

At [1], the buffer is being accessed in the loop with the counter of proper size. Then, at [2], we see the problem with the counter show up, and the buffer is overwritten, causing a vulnerable condition to arise. An attacker could craft arbitrary data to overwrite with and gain code execution through this vulnerability.
