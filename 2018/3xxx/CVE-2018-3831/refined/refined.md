Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-3831:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an information disclosure issue within the Elasticsearch Alerting and Monitoring features. Specifically, when secrets are configured via the API, the Elasticsearch `_cluster/settings` API, when queried, could leak sensitive configuration information. This could include passwords, tokens, or usernames.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information disclosure due to the way Elasticsearch handles secrets configured via the API.
- Insecure handling of sensitive data (passwords, tokens, usernames) within the `_cluster/settings` API.
- Lack of proper access control/filtering for sensitive settings, allowing an authenticated user to view them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An authenticated Elasticsearch user can gain unauthorized access to sensitive configuration data.
- Exposure of credentials like passwords, tokens, or usernames, could lead to further unauthorized access or control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by an authenticated user querying the `_cluster/settings` API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user within the Elasticsearch cluster.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to send requests to the `_cluster/settings` API.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Elasticsearch versions prior to 6.4.1 and 5.6.12.
- There are no known workarounds other than upgrading to the patched versions.
- The vulnerability is identified as ESA-2018-15 within Elastic's security advisories.
