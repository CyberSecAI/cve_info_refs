- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A length miscalculation and underflow in the JPEG parser of Atlantis Word Processor. This miscalculated length, when treated as unsigned, results in an out-of-bounds write during a copying operation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121). The application reads a 16-bit length field from a JPEG file which controls a loop. If the length is zero, or close to zero due to an underflow, the loop will continue indefinitely writing to a buffer on the stack. The buffer is fixed-size, and an attacker can control the length, leading to a buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The stack-based buffer overflow allows an attacker to overwrite data on the stack, potentially including the return address, which can lead to arbitrary code execution under the context of the application.
- **Attack vectors:** A specially crafted JPEG image embedded within a document that the user is convinced to open. The malicious document triggers the vulnerability when the application parses the embedded image.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious document containing a specially crafted JPEG image. The attacker must then convince the victim to open the document using the vulnerable Atlantis Word Processor.
