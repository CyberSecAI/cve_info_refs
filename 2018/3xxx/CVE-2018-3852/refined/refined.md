- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Ocularis Recorder service listens for TCP connections, and if the server receives a command that starts with "dispose", it terminates the VMS_VA process without any authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of authentication/authorization for the "dispose" command, allowing any remote attacker to trigger process termination.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of service by terminating the VMS_VA process, leading to the failure of the Ocularis Recorder functionality.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted TCP packet containing the "dispose" command to the listening port (60801 + ConfigID).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable service and the ability to send TCP packets to the specified port.
