  "CVE-2018-3997": {
    "status": "RELEVANT",
    "details": {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is a use-after-free that occurs when accessing a variable holding a reference to a stale object after the document has been closed and its objects freed. Specifically, the `signatureGetSeedValue` method of a form field saves a reference to the `SeedValue` object, and when the document is closed, the saved reference becomes stale. Accessing this stale reference then triggers the use-after-free.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use-after-free (CWE-416)",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution.",
      "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted PDF document needs to be opened by the user. Visiting a malicious site can also trigger the vulnerability if the browser plugin extension is enabled.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick the user to open the malicious file or visit a malicious site, and if the browser plugin extension is enabled, visiting a malicious site can also trigger the vulnerability."
