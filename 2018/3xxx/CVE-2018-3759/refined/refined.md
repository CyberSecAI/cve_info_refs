Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information regarding CVE-2018-3759:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition in the `private_address_check` Ruby gem.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The gem does not check the actual address the socket uses after the initial DNS resolution.
- It's vulnerable to DNS entries with a Time-To-Live (TTL) of 0, where the initial resolution might return a public address, but a subsequent resolution could return a private address.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially bypass the private address check, leading to connections to internal services that should not be publicly accessible.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs to control a DNS server or have the ability to inject malicious DNS responses with a TTL of 0 for the target domain.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to manipulate DNS resolution for a target domain to return a public address initially, and then a private address upon subsequent lookups, or control over DNS.
- The vulnerable application needs to be using the `private_address_check` gem and making a network connection to the manipulated domain.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 0.5.0 of the `private_address_check` gem.
- The fix involved modifying the `TCPSocket` extension to check the IP address of the socket after it connects, rather than relying on the initial resolution.
- The provided content includes links to the commit that fixes the issue, along with references to the CVE and the related GitHub Security Advisory.
- The content also contains information on ways to mitigate the vulnerability by using DNS caching tools that enforce a minimum TTL or using `curl` which has the capability to resolve to a pre-checked IP.
