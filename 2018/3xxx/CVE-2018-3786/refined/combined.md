### **[attritionorg](/attritionorg)** commented [Aug 21, 2018](#issuecomment-414755623)

| [@fengmk2](https://github.com/fengmk2) After reading the H1 report and the fix and had a question. It seems this issue is based on an untrusted third party being able to specify the --stderr command line argument. Since the vendor reply in the report says: "egg-scripts is not recommended to install global, you should install and use it as npm scripts", it seems like the only attack vector would be tricking an admin into running it with that parameter? Can you confirm, or is there another attack scenario that I am missing? Thanks! |
