Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the unsafe usage of the `sprintf` function within the `ffgphd` and `ffgtkn` functions of the CFITSIO library. `sprintf` does not perform bounds checking, which allows for a stack-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** The `sprintf` function is used to format error messages, and the size of user-supplied data (keywords, values) is not validated against the buffer size allocated for the message. This results in writing past the allocated memory, overwriting data on the stack.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The library does not properly validate the size of the input parameters from the FITS image header before using them in `sprintf` operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By overflowing the stack buffer with carefully crafted input, an attacker can overwrite return addresses and execute arbitrary code.
- **Denial of Service:** The overflow can also cause the application to crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious FITS Image:** An attacker can craft a malicious FITS image containing specially crafted header keywords or values, designed to trigger the buffer overflow.
- **Remote Exploitation:** As the FITS image processing can happen remotely (e.g., through a network service), the vulnerability is remotely exploitable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Malicious Input:** The attacker needs the ability to supply a crafted FITS file to an application that uses the vulnerable CFITSIO library.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is exploitable without authentication, making it accessible to an unauthenticated remote attacker.

**Specific Vulnerable Locations:**

The following locations within the `ffgphd` function are vulnerable:

- Line 2778: When the extension is not an image extension.
- Line 2842: When the second keyword is not "BITPIX."
- Line 2850: When the value of the "BITPIX" keyword is not an integer.
- Line 2950: When the keyword name contains illegal characters.
- Line 2961: When reading the BSCALE keyword value as a double.
- Line 2978: When reading the BZERO keyword value as a double.
- Line 2995: When reading the BLANK keyword value as an integer.
- Line 3012: When reading the PCOUNT keyword value as an integer.
- Line 3025: When reading the GCOUNT keyword value as an integer.

The following location within the `ffgtkn` function is vulnerable:

- Line 8: When the value fails to be converted to an integer.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in CFITSIO version 3.42.
- The issue was fixed in version 3.490 and also backported to 3.430-2.
- The vulnerability is rated as high severity, with a CVSSv3 score of 8.8.
