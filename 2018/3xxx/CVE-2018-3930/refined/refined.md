- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds write occurs due to an integer overflow when processing a crafted Microsoft Word document in the `vbgetfp` method of the Antenna House Office Server Document Converter. The size of the copy operation is determined by a byte in the input file, and the code does not properly validate if this results in a read and write past buffer boundaries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write in the `vbgetfp` method.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary remote code execution due to memory corruption.
- **Attack vectors**: A crafted Microsoft Word (DOC) document can be used to trigger the out-of-bounds write during the conversion process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a malicious DOC file to the server. No special privileges or network position is required. The application needs to process the file.
