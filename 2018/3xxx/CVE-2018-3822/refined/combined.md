**X-Pack Security SAML vulnerability (ESA-2018-07)**

X-Pack Security versions 6.2.0, 6.2.1, and 6.2.2 are vulnerable to a user impersonation attack via incorrect XML canonicalization and DOM traversal. An attacker might have been able to impersonate a legitimate user if the SAML Identity Provider allows for self registration with arbitrary identifiers and the attacker can register an account which an identifier that shares a suffix with a legitimate account. Both of those conditions must be true in order to exploit this flaw.

**Affected Versions**

X-Pack Security 6.2.0, 6.2.1, and 6.2.2

**Solutions and Mitigations:**

Users should upgrade to Elasticsearch version 6.2.3.

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-3822
