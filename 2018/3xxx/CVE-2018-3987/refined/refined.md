- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from Viber using an intent (`android.media.action.IMAGE_CAPTURE`) to take photos in secret chats, which delegates the actual photo capture to other applications, typically the native camera app. While Viber provides a path to save the photo, the camera application also saves a copy to the Android file system, which is not deleted when the secret chat is deleted.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Information Disclosure: Photos taken in secret chats are not properly deleted from the device, even after the chat is removed, exposing them to other apps.
  - Insecure handling of Intents: Viber relies on third-party applications for photo capture and doesn't properly manage the resulting files.

- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability can expose private photos taken in secret chats to unauthorized applications on the Android device. This violates user privacy and could lead to further security issues if sensitive information is exposed.

- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the Android device. An attacker could potentially use another app on the phone to access the photos.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - The attacker needs to have an application installed on the user's device.
   - The attacker does not need any special permissions to access the vulnerable location since the photos are saved by default within a publicly accessible folder.
   - The attacker can be a malicious application installed on the device or a user with access to the file system.
