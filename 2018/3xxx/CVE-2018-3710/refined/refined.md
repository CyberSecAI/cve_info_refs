Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-3710:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from two primary issues within GitLab's project import feature:
1. **Reusing Temporary Directories:** GitLab reuses temporary directories for unpacking project import files.
2. **Delayed Symlink Removal:** Symlinks are removed only after a successful unarchiving of the import file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1. **Directory Traversal:** The combination of reused temporary directories and delayed symlink removal allows for directory traversal attacks.
2. **Symlink Manipulation:** Attackers can use specially crafted tar files containing symlinks to point to sensitive directories on the server.
3. **File Overwrite:** By exploiting the symlink and crafting a second tar file, attackers can overwrite arbitrary files owned by the `git` user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
1. **Remote Command Execution:** By overwriting the `authorized_keys` file, an attacker can gain SSH access to the GitLab server with the privileges of the `git` user.
2. **Complete Access:** The attacker can gain complete access to the GitLab application and repositories.
3. **Data Manipulation:** The attacker could potentially access, modify, or delete data within the system.
4. **System Compromise:** Overwriting other critical files like SSH configs, GitLab code, Rails secrets, or user crontabs can lead to further compromise and system instability.

**Attack Vectors:**
1. **Project Import Feature:** The vulnerability is exploited through the GitLab's project import functionality.
2. **Malicious Tar Files:** The attack uses specifically crafted tar archive files containing symlinks and malicious payloads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1. **GitLab Account:** The attacker requires a valid account on the vulnerable GitLab instance.
2. **Knowledge of File System:** The attacker needs to know the location of files they wish to overwrite.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was tested against GitLab CE and EE version 10.3.3.
- The attack involves uploading two specially crafted tar files, one to create a symlink, and another to overwrite files through the symlink.
- The attack uses a combination of techniques to force `tar` to exit with an error, thus preventing the cleanup of the symlink
- Hex editing the second tar archive is required to ensure the directory is not extracted preventing tar from overwriting the symlink.
- The provided exploit focuses on overwriting the `authorized_keys` file for SSH access, but other files are vulnerable, depending on the setup
- The exploit would not work against GitLab instances using the database to authorize SSH access, however, other files can be targeted.
- The proposed solution is to use random directory locations for all imports and to deny imports for any archive containing suspicious file types before they are written to the filesystem. Alternatively, the file archive format could be changed to avoid dangerous file types.
