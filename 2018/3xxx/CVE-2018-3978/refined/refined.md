- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap-based buffer overflow occurs due to incorrect size calculation when processing compressed pieces in a Word document within the Atlantis Word Processor. Specifically, the size of the CLX array is determined by `Clx.lcb`, and if this size is not a multiple of the size of each element, writing a new character position of a compressed piece will occur out of bounds of the allocated buffer.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122) due to an out-of-bounds write.
  - Improper size calculation for the CLX array, using a size that does not align with the structure being parsed, leading to out-of-bounds write during processing of compressed pieces of a Word document.

- **Impact of exploitation**:
  - Arbitrary code execution due to the heap overflow.
  - Memory corruption, leading to application instability or potentially further exploitation via a controlled unlink of the Delphi heap.

- **Attack vectors**:
  - A specially crafted Microsoft Word document (.doc) is required.
  - The user must open the malicious document with a vulnerable version of Atlantis Word Processor.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
  - The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious .doc file.
  - The attacker needs to convince the victim to open the crafted document with the vulnerable software.
