Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-3827:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by the repository-azure plugin logging Azure credentials when the log level is set to TRACE.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Sensitive data exposure: Azure credentials are being logged in plain text when the TRACE logging level is enabled for the repository-azure plugin.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exposure of sensitive Azure credentials which could lead to unauthorized access to Azure resources if the logs are compromised.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is related to the logging configuration of the Elasticsearch repository-azure plugin. Specifically, if the log level is set to TRACE, the plugin will expose the Azure credentials in the logs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the Elasticsearch logs and have knowledge or ability to modify the logging configurations to set TRACE logging levels.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of Elasticsearch.
- The fix involves upgrading Elasticsearch to version 6.3.0, which will prevent the repository-azure plugin from exposing Azure credentials in logs.
