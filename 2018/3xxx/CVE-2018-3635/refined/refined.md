Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-3635:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation within the Intel Rapid Storage Technology (RST) installer. This lack of proper validation allows for potential privilege escalation or denial of service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the inadequate checking of inputs by the installer, leading to exploitable behavior.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code, specifically a custom DLL, via the Windows mechanism of COR_PROFILER environment variables

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An unprivileged user can elevate their privileges to those of the installer, typically SYSTEM, by setting specific environment variables
*   **Denial of Service (Installer):** The vulnerability may lead to a denial of service of the installer process, making it unusable.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges, allowing them to take control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the target system.
*   **User Interaction:** The user needs to execute the vulnerable installer after the malicious environment variables are set
*   **Environment Variables:** The attack leverages the ability to set environment variables related to the .NET profiler (`COR_ENABLE_PROFILING`, `COR_PROFILER`, and `COR_PROFILER_PATH`). The attacker can set these environment variables without administrative privileges using `SETX.exe`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unprivileged User:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system but does not need administrator rights initially.
*   **File System Access:** The attacker needs the ability to create files (the malicious DLL) in a location they control and the ability to execute the vulnerable installer
* **Understanding of Windows Environment Variables:** The attacker must understand how environment variables can be used to inject code into the context of an elevated process.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided content indicates that Intel initially fixed the vulnerability in the installer, but the issue was reintroduced later.
*   The provided exploit description uses the .NET profiler mechanism, which uses specific environment variables to load a custom DLL (sentinel.dll) when an application starts
*   The vulnerability was initially reported by Stefan Kanthak
* The provided CVSS 3.0 vector is `CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H` which translates to:
    * AV:L (Attack Vector: Local)
    * AC:L (Attack Complexity: Low)
    * PR:L (Privileges Required: Low)
    * UI:R (User Interaction: Required)
    * S:C (Scope: Changed)
    * C:H (Confidentiality Impact: High)
    * I:H (Integrity Impact: High)
    * A:H (Availability Impact: High)
