### TALOS-2018-0543

## ACD Systems Canvas Draw 4 Huff Table Out-of-bounds Write Code Execution Vulnerability

##### July 19, 2018

##### CVE Number

CVE-2018-3859

### Summary

An exploitable out-of-bounds write exists in the TIFF parsing functionality of Canvas Draw version 4.0.0. A specially crafted TIFF image processed via the application can lead to an out-of-bounds write, overwriting arbitrary data. An attacker can deliver a TIFF image to trigger this vulnerability and gain code execution.

### Tested Versions

ACDSystems Canvas Draw 4.0.0

### Product URLs

<https://www.canvasgfx.com/en/products/canvas-draw>

### CVSSv3 Score

8.8 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-787: Out-of-Bounds Write

### Details

Canvas Draw 4 is a graphics editing tool used to create and edit images, as well as other graphic-related material. This product has a large user base and is popular in its specific field. The vulnerable component is in the handling of TIFF images. TIFF is a raster-based image format used in graphics editing projects, thus making it a very common file format for such an application.

The vulnerability arises in the parsing of a tiled TIFF image with the Adobe Deflate compression scheme. This compression algorithm is not part of standard TIFF algorithms, but was added as an extension from Adobe, and uses a lossless Deflate compression scheme utilizing the zlib compressed data format. The Canvas Draw application supports this compression format and is able to handle files using it. The vulnerability arises in attempting to build a Huffman table. Huffman coding is one of the two things that make up the Deflate encoding scheme.

When using the Deflate encoding scheme, the application takes user data directly from the TIFF image without validation. The initial crash is shown below.

```
* thread #1: tid = 0x92a99, 0x0000000101e01273 ImageGear18`_DFL_huff_table_build + 410, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=1, address=0x39c5ec80)
frame #0: 0x0000000101e01273 ImageGear18`_DFL_huff_table_build + 410
ImageGear18`_DFL_huff_table_build:
->  0x101e01273 <+410>: mov    dword ptr [rax + 4*rsi], edx
    0x101e01276 <+413>: add    r12, 0x4
    0x101e0127a <+417>: add    r14, 0x2
    0x101e0127e <+421>: dec    r15d

```

The value inside of RSI has come directly from the TIFF data field. Below is the relevant code leading up to the out of bounds write.

```
movzx   edx, [rbp+rcx*2+int_buffer]           [0]
lea     esi, [rdx+1]                          [1]
mov     [rbp+rcx*2+int_buffer], si
mov     [r12], dx
movzx   edx, word ptr [r14]
movsxd  rsi, [rbp+rcx*4+int_2]
lea     edi, [rsi+1]
mov     [rbp+rcx*4+int_2], edi
mov     [rax+rsi*4], edx                      [2]

```

The value inside of RCX at [0] is controlled via the compressed data inside the TIFF image. It then uses the value given and loads it into ESI, [1]. After doing some data shuffling, we finally get to the use again at [2], where a user-controlled value is written, too. This leads to an exploitable out-of-bounds write condition. By using specially crafted data, an attacker could gain the ability to execute code through this vulnerability.
