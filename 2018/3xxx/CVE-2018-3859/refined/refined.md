The content is related to CVE-2018-3859.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the parsing of a tiled TIFF image with the Adobe Deflate compression scheme within the Canvas Draw application. Specifically, the application takes user data directly from the TIFF image without proper validation when building a Huffman table.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Out-of-bounds write vulnerability when building a Huffman table.
  - Lack of proper input validation when parsing user-controlled data from TIFF image's compressed data.
  - User-controlled data from TIFF file is directly used to calculate memory offsets.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution by crafting a malicious TIFF image that triggers an out-of-bounds write, overwriting arbitrary memory.

**Attack vectors:**
  - A specially crafted TIFF image is processed by the vulnerable application.
  - The attacker must deliver the malicious TIFF image to a user of the vulnerable software.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - Ability to craft a malicious TIFF file with a specific structure and compressed data.
  - Needs to trick a user to open/process the malicious TIFF file using the vulnerable application.
