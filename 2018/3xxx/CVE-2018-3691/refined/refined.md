- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Some implementations in the IntelÂ® Integrated Performance Primitives Cryptography Library do not ensure constant execution time. This means the time it takes for certain cryptographic operations to complete can vary depending on the input data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Timing side-channel vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Information disclosure. An attacker could potentially infer sensitive information by observing the timing variations of cryptographic operations.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the same system as the vulnerable library. They also need some means of measuring the execution time of cryptographic operations.
