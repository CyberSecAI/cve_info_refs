- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the PCX image parsing functionality of Computerinsel Photoline. Specifically, the run length encoding (RLE) handling is flawed. The program increments a pointer based on the run length read from the image data. By providing a large run length value near the end of the image data, the program increments the pointer beyond its intended bounds. This results in an out-of-bounds write when data is written to the memory location.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) due to improper handling of run length values in PCX image parsing.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution by crafting a malicious PCX image, which leads to an out-of-bounds write that overwrites arbitrary data.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a malicious PCX image that is processed by the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted PCX file to the application. User interaction is required to open or process the crafted PCX image using the vulnerable software.
