The provided content is related to CVE-2018-3857.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the TIFF parsing functionality of ACD Systems Canvas Draw 4.0.0. Specifically, it occurs when processing a compressed and tiled TIFF image using CCITT Group 3 compression. The size calculation for the memcpy operation is based on user-controlled data that isn't properly validated, resulting in a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122)
- Improper validation of user-controlled data used in size calculations.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation leads to an out-of-bounds write, allowing an attacker to overwrite arbitrary data on the heap, potentially leading to code execution. The overflow corrupts the free list, causing a crash when the corrupted data is later freed.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a specially crafted TIFF image. The attacker delivers a malicious TIFF file to the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted TIFF image to the vulnerable application, which requires user interaction (opening the crafted image in the software). The attacker does not need any special privileges.
