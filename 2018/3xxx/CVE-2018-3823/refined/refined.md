Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-3823:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue in X-Pack Machine Learning.
- Malicious data injected during the configuration of machine learning jobs leads to the execution of arbitrary scripts within the context of other users viewing the job results.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied data used in the display of machine learning job results, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can obtain sensitive information from other Machine Learning users.
- An attacker can perform destructive actions on behalf of other Machine Learning users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker with `manage_ml` permissions creates a job containing malicious data as part of the job configuration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attacker needs `manage_ml` permissions to create malicious jobs.
- Attackers can inject data into an index that has a ML job running against it.
- The attacker's malicious scripts are executed when a different user views the results of the compromised machine learning job.

**Additional Notes:**
- The content provides more detail than the official CVE description, specifically the method of attack and the impact of exploitation.
- The vulnerability exists in all versions of X-Pack Machine Learning before versions 6.2.4 and 5.6.9.
- The provided content mentions another CVE (CVE-2018-3824) related to a similar XSS vulnerability in X-Pack Machine Learning but triggered by injecting data into an index which has a ML job running against it.
