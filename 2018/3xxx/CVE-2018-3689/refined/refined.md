- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Vulnerabilities in the Intel Architectural Enclave Service Manager (AESM) for Linux.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerabilities allow for a denial-of-service (DoS) attack by disabling the AESM.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation disables AESM, preventing remote attestation of enclaves. This affects all users of SGX on the affected server, or within a specific VM in a multi-VM setup. The confidentiality or integrity of SGX data is not compromised.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack can be launched by an unprivileged user with local access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Local access as an unprivileged user is required.
