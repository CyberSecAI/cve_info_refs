Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2018-3646:

**1. Verification of Relevance**

*   The provided content explicitly mentions CVE-2018-3646 as being related to L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF) and its impact on hypervisors.
*   The content directly discusses vulnerabilities related to speculative execution and the L1 data cache.
*   The information discusses the exploitation of L1TF in virtualized environments.

**2. Extracted Information**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    *   The root cause of CVE-2018-3646 is a vulnerability in the way x86 microprocessors handle speculative execution during page table walks, specifically when a page table entry is not present or has reserved bits set.  The processor speculatively computes the physical address and performs an L1D cache lookup, and if data is present, it could be leaked via a side channel.
    *   In virtualized environments, this vulnerability is enabled by the implementation of Extended Page Tables (EPT), which allows hypervisors to delegate part of the page table management to guest VMs. A malicious guest can then create a not present PTE to bypass the two stages of address translation and read host/other guest memory if cached in L1D cache.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   Speculative execution bypass during page table walks.
    *   Exposure of data in the L1 data cache that should be protected.
    *   Bypass of EPT guest-to-host address translations.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can potentially read arbitrary host RAM.
    *   This includes data belonging to Xen, data belonging to other guests, and data belonging to different security contexts within the same guest.
    *   In virtualized environments, a malicious guest can use this vulnerability to read host hypervisor or other guest physical memory.
    *   An unprivileged system user or process could exploit the L1TF vulnerability to read data from arbitrary physical memory locations of the kernel and/or other processes running on the system provided that the data is first loaded into the L1 data cache.
    *   In virtualized environments, a malicious guest can potentially read memory belonging to the hypervisor, or other virtual machines running on the same host.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Local attackers in guest virtual machines or on the host OS can exploit this vulnerability
    *   Attackers could be a guest kernel (which can manipulate the pagetables directly) or could be guest userspace.
    *   A malicious user on a system can read data on the physical system.
    *   A malicious guest OS or container can access information from other guests or the host.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to execute code on an affected Intel x86 processor (at least Merom onwards).
    *   Ability to manipulate page tables (if kernel) or cause page faults (if userspace).
    *   For virtualized environments, guest VMs can exploit the vulnerability using "not present" page table entries and EPT.

**3. Additional Technical Details**

*   Processors speculatively access physical addresses from Not Present PTEs, and if these contents are cached into the L1 data cache, the memory access succeeds.
*   Page Table Inversion mitigation updates the physical address in Not Present PTEs to point to a physical address that is not in memory and/or uncacheable, preventing data from being in L1 data cache.
*   The L1 data cache is the first level of a fast on-chip processor memory hierarchy (32KB in size) that contains copies of data also held in the external main memory chips.
*   The L1 is shared between two peer hyperthreads within an Intel processor core.
*   Simultaneous multithreading (SMT), also known as Hyper-Threading,  allows modern processors to improve system performance by executing more than one instruction stream simultaneously on separate logical processors, which all share the same L1 cache and can be leveraged in attacks.
*   Disabling SMT/Hyper-Threading and using the L1D_FLUSH feature on every VMEntry is recommended for full mitigation in HVM and PVH guests (Hardware Assisted Paging).

**4. Mitigations and Resolutions**

*   **Microcode updates**: Microcode updates are required for preventing SMM data leaks.
*   **Software updates to hypervisors**: Patches are required to prevent guests from leaking data belonging to the hypervisor or other guests (details mentioned below).
*   **OS and guest kernel software updates**: Are required to prevent guest userspace from leaking data belonging to the kernel or other processes within the same guest.
*   **Page Table Inversion**: Updated kernels modify the physical address in Not Present PTEs to point to uncacheable memory.
*   **L1D Cache Flush**: Microcode or updated kernels flush L1 data cache of potential secrets when starting VM code. The L1D_FLUSH feature needs to be enabled on every VMEntry.
*   **SMT/Hyper-Threading Disable**: For untrusted guest environments, the system should not schedule two different virtual machines to share two logical processors from a single core. Therefore SMT/Hyper-Threading may be disabled to avoid sharing core L1 cache.

**Specific actions for PV guests:**

*   If the PV guest attempts to write an L1TF-vulnerable PTE, shadow paging is activated and forced upon the guest. If shadow paging is not compiled, then the guest is crashed instead.
*   `pv-l1tf=` flag to control this behavior. It is enabled by default for guests but disabled for dom0.

**Specific actions for HVM and PVH guests (with hardware assisted paging):**

*   SMT/Hyperthreading is not disabled by default but can be disabled by setting `smt=<bool>`.
*   L1D_FLUSH is enabled by default (controlled by `spec-ctrl=[no-]l1d-flush`), subject to microcode availability.
*   New xl/libxl options (vm.cpumask, vm.hvm.cpumask, vm.pv.cpumask) have been added for hard affinity settings.

**Red Hat Mitigations**

*   Red Hat recommends that customers take corrective actions, including manually enabling specific kernel parameters or potentially disabling features like Intel Hyper-Threading, after the available updates have been applied.
*   The updated kernel would still flush the L1 data cache in software if the hardware feature “flush\_l1d” is not available.
*   The updated kernel packages introduce the kernel boot parameter “l1tf=[full/full,force/flush/flush,nosmt/flush,nowarn/off]” to control L1TF mitigations on affected CPUs, with default value set to “flush”.
*  KVM module parameter kvm-intel.vmentry\_l1d\_flush: to control L1 data cache flush operations. The default value is “cond”.
*   The “nosmt” kernel parameter and related sysfs entries can be used to manage SMT/Hyper-Threading at runtime. However, it is strongly recommended to manage them at boot or from BIOS settings.
*   Disabling EPT mitigates the L1TF issue, as the VMM/Hypervisor manages the address translations for the guest. However, it may not be a viable performance option and is controlled via the `kvm-intel.ept` kernel module parameter.

**Xen Mitigations:**

*   PV guests which attempt to write L1TF-vulnerable PTEs are forced to use shadow paging (or crash).
*   HVM and PVH guests running with Hardware Assisted Paging can be prevented from leaking data entirely by disabling SMT/Hyper-threading (if available and active in the BIOS), and by using the L1D_FLUSH feature on every VMEntry.
*   New toolstack options provide control over CPU hard affinity settings.

**5. Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability has similarities to Meltdown and Spectre, which also exploit speculative execution, but exploits a different aspect of processor design (page table walks rather than branch prediction).
*   The issue is referred to as L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF) by the larger industry and as “Foreshadow” by the security researcher.
