Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-3826:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the Elasticsearch `_snapshot` API. When `access_key` and `security_key` parameters are set using this API, they are exposed in plain text to users who can query the same API.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Exposure:** Sensitive information (access keys and security keys) are being disclosed in plain text. This contradicts the recommended practice of storing these credentials in the keystore.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker who can query the `_snapshot` API can obtain access keys and security keys. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access to the underlying snapshot data or other associated resources depending on the access granted by the keys.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs the ability to send requests to the Elasticsearch `_snapshot` API. This implies that the attacker needs network access to the Elasticsearch instance.
*  **API Query:** An attacker needs to send a request to the vulnerable `_snapshot` API endpoint that returns the keys.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user, with privileges to query the `_snapshot` API,
*   Network access to the Elasticsearch instance is also a necessity.

**Affected Versions:**

*   Elasticsearch versions 6.0.0-beta1 to 6.2.4 are affected by this vulnerability.

**Mitigation:**

*   The vulnerability is resolved in Elasticsearch version 6.3.0, which prevents the `_snapshot` API from returning the access and security keys in plain text. It is recommended to upgrade to this or a later version.
