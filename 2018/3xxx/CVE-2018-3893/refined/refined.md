The content is related to CVE-2018-3893.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `video-core` process incorrectly extracts fields from a user-controlled JSON payload, leading to a buffer overflow on the stack due to the use of `strncpy` without proper length validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Multiple stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the `/cameras/XXXX/clips` handler of `video-core`'s HTTP server, specifically when handling the `captureTime`, `startTime`, `endTime`, `callbackUrl`, and `correlationId` parameters from the JSON payload. The `strncpy` function copies user-provided data into fixed-size stack buffers without proper size checks, making them vulnerable to overflows.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the `video-core` process, which runs as root.

**Attack vectors:**
- Impersonating the remote SmartThings servers to send arbitrary HTTP requests to `hubCore`, which then relays them to the vulnerable `video-core` process.
- Creating a malicious SmartApp that can send HTTP requests directly to the vulnerable `video-core` process via localhost connection.
- Potentially sending a malicious request from the SmartThings mobile application to the remote SmartThings servers, and then relayed to the device (not tested due to live infrastructure concerns).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to impersonate the remote SmartThings servers or create a malicious SmartApp to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `video-core` process.
- For the untested mobile application vector, the attacker needs to own a valid OAuth bearer token, or the username/password to obtain it.
- The attacker needs to know a valid `camera-id` parameter in order to target the vulnerable path.
