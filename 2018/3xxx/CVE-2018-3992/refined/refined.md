    ],
    "vulnerability": {
      "root_cause": "A multi-page PDF document can have JavaScript actions attached to “page open” and “page close” events. When executing embedded JavaScript code, a document can be closed, which essentially frees a lot of used objects, but the JavaScript can continue to execute. Changing a page at a precise moment after the document is closed can lead to a use-after-free condition.",

      "impact": "Arbitrary code execution",
      "attack_vector": "A specially crafted PDF document",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to trick the user to open the malicious file to trigger this vulnerability. If the browser plugin extension is enabled, visiting a malicious site can also trigger the vulnerability."
    },
     "description": "An exploitable use-after-free vulnerability exists in the JavaScript engine of Foxit Software’s Foxit PDF Reader, version 9.2.0.9297. A specially crafted PDF document can trigger a previously freed object in memory to be reused, resulting in arbitrary code execution. An attacker needs to trick the user to open the malicious file to trigger this vulnerability. If the browser plugin extension is enabled, visiting a malicious site can also trigger the vulnerability."
