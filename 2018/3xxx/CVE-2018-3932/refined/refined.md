- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stack-based buffer overflow in the `putlsttbl` method of the `DfvDocReaderNS::ListProperty` class during the parsing of the `Xst` record within a Microsoft Word document.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `putlsttbl` method reads a size value (`cchXst`) from the document.  It then enters a loop where it writes 4 bytes to a fixed-size stack buffer (`rgtchar`) for each iteration, based on the size value.  The code does not validate `cchXst`, allowing an attacker to specify a size that causes a buffer overflow in `rgtchar`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** By overflowing the stack buffer, an attacker can overwrite the return address, allowing for arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** A crafted Microsoft Word document (DOC file) is used as the attack vector. The vulnerable software attempts to convert this malicious document to PDF or other formats triggering the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to supply a malicious DOC file to the vulnerable document converter.  No special privileges or network access are required beyond the ability to submit a document to the converter. The attacker needs to craft a malicious DOC file.
