## restforce vulnerable to Improper Input Validation

Critical severity

[Vulnerability details](/advisories/GHSA-534w-937m-v7x3)
[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-534w-937m-v7x3/dependabot)

## Package

bundler

restforce
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

< 3.0.0

## Patched versions

3.0.0

## Description

A flaw in how restforce constructs URLs may allow an attacker to inject additional parameters into Salesforce API requests.

## Impact

This flaw is only exploitable in applications that pass user input directly to restforce's select, find, describe, update, upsert, and destroy methods.

Vulnerable code might look like:

```
  client.select('SomeSalesForceObject', params[:some-id],
     ...)
```

In such an application, attackers could pass `0016000000MRatd/describe` as a request parameter, causing the server to make a request to a different endpoint than the server is designed to handle. Since the Salesforce REST API supports overriding HTTP methods via a request parameter, an attacker could also cause the client's `select()` method to modify data, by passing `0016000000MRatd/?_HttpMethod=PATCH&other-query-params=...`.

## Workarounds

If possible, applications should track salesforce IDs internally, rather than passing user-supplied IDs to salesforce. Such practice mitigates this vulnerability, and in general is desirable for ensuring strong access control.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
