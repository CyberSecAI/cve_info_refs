# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2018-0585

## Computerinsel Photoline PSD Blending Channel Code Execution Vulnerability

##### July 11, 2018

##### CVE Number

CVE-2018-3921

### Summary

A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the PSD-parsing functionality of Computerinsel Photoline 20.54. A specially crafted PSD image processed via the application can lead to a stack overflow, overwriting arbitrary data. An attacker can deliver a PSD image to trigger this vulnerability and gain code execution.

### Tested Versions

Computerinsel Photoline 20.54 for OS X

### Product URLs

<https://www.pl32.com/>

### CVSSv3 Score

8.8 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow

### Details

Photoline is an image processing tool used to modify and edit images, as well as other graphic-related material. This product has a large user base, and is popular in its specific field. The vulnerability arises in parsing the PSD image, specifically dealing with the blending channels inside of the image. The PSD format supports the ability to have multiple layers and masks per image, and the vulnerability is in how the software deals with the length of these layers. By looking at the vulnerable images Blending Layer Length value, we see that it is 0x40000000. Shown below is the code using this value causing the overflow.

```
LOWORD(v6) = memcpy_wrapper(sstack_buffer, &image_Data, blending_channel_1);

```

The blending channel value is read directly from the image and used to copy this data into a stack-based buffer. This causes a direct overflow of the stack, and an overwrite of arbitrary data. There is a stack cookie present, but this could be circumvented by other means. This vulnerability could be exploited to gain code execution.
