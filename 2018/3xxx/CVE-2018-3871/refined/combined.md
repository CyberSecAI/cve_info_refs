## ACD Systems Canvas Draw 4 Invert Map Out-of-Bounds Write Code Execution Vulnerability

##### July 19, 2018

##### CVE Number

CVE-2018-3871

### Summary

An exploitable out-of-bounds write exists in the PCX parsing functionality of Canvas Draw version 4.0.0. A specially crafted PCX image processed via the application can lead to an out-of-bounds write, overwriting arbitrary data. An attacker can deliver a PCX image to trigger this vulnerability and gain code execution.

### Tested Versions

ACDSystems Canvas Draw 4.0.0

### Product URLs

<https://www.pl32.com/>

### CVSSv3 Score

8.8 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write

### Details

Canvas Draw 4 is a graphics editing tool used to create and edit images, as well as other graphic-related material. This product has a large user base and is popular in its specific field. The vulnerable component is in the handling of PCX images. PCX was a popular image format with early computers and although has been replaced by more sophisticated formats, it is still in use and fully supported inside of Canvas Draw.

The vulnerability arises in parsing the PCX image, specifically dealing with the column and row sizes of the image. Inside of the PCX header, values are set to determine the location of image data and the size of the image itself. By passing in incorrect values, the application will write out of bounds, attempting to access the image data. A look at the image header is shown below.

```
[TOP] 0
[BOTTOM] 31
[LEFT] 225            [0]
[RIGHT] 31
[COLUMNS] -193
[ROWS] 32

```

The columns and rows are calculated by subtracting the bottom from the top, or subtracting the right from the left, respectively. As seen above, [0], the left value is far too large, causing a negative column value. This leads to an out-of-bounds write when the image map is accessed. The crash is shown below.

```
->  0x114e2290d <+71>: not    dword ptr [rcx]               [1]
    0x114e2290f <+73>: add    rcx, 0x4
    0x114e22913 <+77>: dec    ebx
    0x114e22915 <+79>: jne    0x114e2290d               ; <+71>

```

At location [1], RCX is user-controlled determined by the column sizes shown above. This creates an exploitable condition and could be used to gain code execution.
