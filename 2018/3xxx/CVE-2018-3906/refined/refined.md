- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow in the `video-core` process of Samsung SmartThings Hub, caused by insecurely extracting the `shard.videoHostURL` field from its SQLite database without proper bounds checking.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-120) due to using `strcpy` to copy the `videoHostURL` from the database into a fixed-size stack buffer without validating its length,
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Code execution on the `video-core` process, which runs as root.
    - Denial of service by crashing the `video-core` process.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Sending a PUT request to video-coreâ€™s HTTP server for the path "/cameras/<camera-id>/streams/<stream-name>".
    - Triggering the vulnerable function through the "imageUploader" and "mp4Uploader" threads that call it periodically
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the `video-core`'s HTTP server running on the local host port 3000. This can be done via:
        - Exploiting a separate vulnerability (TALOS-2018-0556) to modify the database.
        - Sending HTTP requests from a SmartApp.
        - Executing commands directly on the device using an exploit.
    - The attacker also needs to know a valid `<camera-id>` and `<stream-name>` to make a targeted request.
