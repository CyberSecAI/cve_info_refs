      "cve_id": "CVE-2018-3964",
      "root_cause": "An exploitable use-after-free vulnerability exists in the JavaScript engine of Foxit Softwareâ€™s Foxit PDF Reader. When executing embedded JavaScript code, a document can be closed, which essentially frees a lot of used objects, but the JavaScript can continue to execute. Invoking a method which keeps a stale reference to a now-freed object can lead to a use-after-free condition.",

      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to trick the user to open the malicious file or visit the malicious website.",
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability lies in invoking the getPageNumWords method of the active document with a crafted object as an argument. The provided Javascript PoC shows that by overloading the valueOf method of an object, a document can be closed and a stale object reference is retained, leading to a use-after-free condition."
