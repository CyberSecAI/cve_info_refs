  "datePublished": "2018-10-01",
  "vulnerabilityType": [
    "Use-After-Free"
  ],
  "affectedProducts": [
    "Foxit PDF Reader 9.1.0.5096"
  ],
  "summary": "An exploitable use-after-free vulnerability exists in the JavaScript engine of Foxit Softwareâ€™s Foxit PDF Reader version 9.1.0.5096. A specially crafted PDF document can trigger a previously freed object in memory to be reused, resulting in arbitrary code execution. An attacker needs to trick the user to open the malicious file to trigger this vulnerability. If the browser plugin extension is enabled, visiting a malicious site can also trigger the vulnerability.",
  "details": "The vulnerability lies in accessing a saved reference to `this.dataObjects` object, which can trigger a use-after-free condition. After closing the current document, a large amount of objects are freed, but by modifying the `toString` method of `this.dataObjects` object, a use-after-free condition is triggered. An access violation happens when accessing memory pointed to by `ecx` which points to a free memory location. If this memory location is placed under attacker control, double dereference could lead to control over contents of `edx` which is used in a direct `call` instruction, thus leading to arbitrary code execution.",
  "impact": "Arbitrary code execution",
  "attackVectors": [
    "A specially crafted PDF document can trigger a previously freed object in memory to be reused.",
     "If the browser plugin extension is enabled, visiting a malicious site can also trigger the vulnerability."
   ],
  "weaknesses": [
    "Use After Free: When executing embedded JavaScript code, a document can be closed, which essentially frees numerous objects, but the JavaScript can continue to execute. Direct access to a now-freed object can lead to a use-after-free condition."
  ],
  "attackerCapabilities": "An attacker needs to trick the user to open the malicious file to trigger this vulnerability. If the browser plugin extension is enabled, visiting a malicious site can also trigger the vulnerability."
