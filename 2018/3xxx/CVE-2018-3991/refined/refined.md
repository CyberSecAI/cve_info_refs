The provided content relates to CVE-2018-3991.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Integer overflow in the `alloc_and_initialize` function when calculating the size of the buffer to be allocated, triggered by a large user-controlled `size` value (specifically 0xFFFFFFFF). This leads to a heap buffer overflow in the `WkbProgramLow` function when the attacker-controlled data is copied into the undersized buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the `WkbProgramLow` function of WibuKey network server management.
- Integer overflow when calculating the allocation size.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution, potentially leading to system-level privileges.
- Kernel memory corruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted TCP packet to port 22347/tcp of the WibuKey Network server management service.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
- The attacker does not need any authentication or prior privileges.
