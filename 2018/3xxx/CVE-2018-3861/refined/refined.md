- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the parsing of compressed tiled TIFF images. Specifically, the code responsible for reading the tiles does not validate data read from the image, allowing an attacker to control an address used for an out-of-bounds write.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write due to lack of validation on the read address for image data. The vulnerability is triggered when parsing a compressed tiled TIFF image.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can achieve code execution by delivering a specially crafted TIFF image to trigger an out-of-bounds write, overwriting arbitrary data.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a specially crafted TIFF image processed by the vulnerable application (Computerinsel Photoline).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious TIFF file to the application for processing, which is typically through user interaction (opening a file).
