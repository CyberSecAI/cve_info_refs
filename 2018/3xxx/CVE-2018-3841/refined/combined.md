# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2018-0524

## Pixar Renderman IT Display Service 0x69 Command Denial-of-Service Vulnerability

##### June 14, 2018

##### CVE Number

CVE-2018-3841

### Summary

A denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the Pixar Renderman IT Display Service 21.6. The vulnerability is present in the parsing of a network packet without proper validation of the packet. The data read-in is not validated, and its use can lead to a null pointer dereference. The IT application is opened by a user and then listens for a connection on port 4001. An attacker can deliver an attack once the application has been opened.

### Tested Versions

Renderman 21.6

### Product URLs

<https://renderman.pixar.com>

### CVSSv3 Score

5.3 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L

### CWE

CWE-476: Null Pointer Dereference

### Details

Renderman is a rendering application used in animation and film production. It is widely used for advanced rendering and shading in many large-scale environments. The application takes a custom file format known as a RIB, parses it, and then passes it along to one of various servers. An application included with Renderman is called the “IT Display Service”. This application accepts connections and receives a packet containing information about where to find the image for rendering. The application listens on port 4001 for connections from any host. An example of the communications is below.

```
00000000: 69dd dd                                  h..

```

The first byte is parsed in a command loop, and functionality is called depending on the value. The vulnerability arises because validation is not checked after a direct socket read in the 0x69 command. The relevant code is shown below.

```
push    r12
push    r13
push    r14
sub     rsp, 20h
mov     r14, rdi
lea     rdi, [rsp+38h+var_30] ; this
lea     rsi, [r14+68h]  ; std::string *
call    std::string::string(std::string const&) ; [1]
lea     rdi, [rsp+38h+var_30] ; this

```

A socket read takes place, directing the code to the 0x69 command. At this point, a standard library call is made with no validation if the string passed in is not null. This leads to offset 0x68 of a null pointer to be dereferenced, and results in a denial-of-service condition.
