- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Heap-based buffer overflow due to an undersized allocation when processing a Windows Enhanced Metafile (EMF) image. The application allocates memory based on a size field in the EMF header, which is attacker controlled, but then copies a fixed amount of data (0x64 bytes) into this buffer, leading to a buffer overflow if the allocated size is less than 0x64.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122)
  - Insufficient validation of image size leading to undersized allocation.
  - Incorrectly trusting the size of a file from its header in order to perform an allocation, which then causes a fixed size memory copy that is larger than the allocation
- **Impact of exploitation:** Heap corruption, which can lead to arbitrary code execution under the context of the application.
- **Attack vectors:** A specially crafted image embedded within a document opened using the Atlantis Word Processor.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to convince the victim to open a specially crafted document containing a malicious EMF image.
