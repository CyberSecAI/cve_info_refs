- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stack-based buffer overflow due to the usage of `strcpy` without proper bounds checking when retrieving fields from the "shard" table of the SQLite database. Specifically, the `strcpy` function is used to copy the values of fields like `secretKey`, `accessKey`, `sessionToken`, `bucket`, `directory`, and `region` into fixed-size buffers on the stack without any validation of their length.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-120)
    - Insecure use of `strcpy`
    - Lack of input validation for database fields
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution on the `video-core` process, which runs as root.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - An attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the `video-core` server (port 3000 on localhost), which can be relayed via the `hubCore` process over a persistent TLS connection.
    - The HTTP request modifies values in the database, so that on the next read of those values from the database, the overflow can be triggered by `strcpy`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Ability to send HTTP requests to the `video-core` server. This can be achieved by exploiting the persistent TLS connection from the `hubCore` process or another vulnerability that enables remote access to the HTTP server.
    - The attacker can influence the `shard` database values via an SQL injection vulnerability (TALOS-2018-0556).
