Based on the provided commit diff, this commit addresses a vulnerability in how the `resolve-path` library handles paths with special characters.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The `resolvePath` function in `index.js` did not correctly handle paths containing special characters like `:` and `$`. The `resolve` function from the `path` module was not properly used, leading to incorrect path resolution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Incorrect path resolution when special characters are included in the provided path.
- This can be used to bypass intended directory traversal restrictions, by using special characters, and resolving the path in an unexpected way.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- The impact would be dependent on how the path was used by the application.
- Potential for directory traversal or access to unauthorized files/locations
- Incorrect file locations used in application logic
- If the path is used in file system operations, it might lead to incorrect reads, writes or executions.

**Attack vectors:**

- Providing a path with special characters to the `resolvePath` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- An attacker needs the ability to influence or control the input path passed to the `resolvePath` function.

**Changes in the commit:**
- The `resolvePath` function was changed to use `resolve(root, path)` instead of `normalize(join(resolve(root), path))`.
- Added new tests in `test/resolvePath.js` to test for paths with special characters.

This commit fixes the vulnerability by correctly resolving paths with special characters using `path.resolve`.
