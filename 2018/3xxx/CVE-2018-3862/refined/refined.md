The provided content is a detailed vulnerability report for CVE-2018-3862.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the parsing of compressed tiled TIFF images. Specifically, the `bits_per_sample` value from the image is used to determine a code path in the parsing loop. An attacker can manipulate this value, in conjunction with other parameters like tile width, to trigger an out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds write: The code calculates a memory address based on attacker-controlled values and writes data to that address without proper bounds checking, leading to memory corruption.
- Insufficient input validation: The application does not properly validate the `bits_per_sample` and tile width values, allowing an attacker to control memory access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Code execution: The out-of-bounds write can be used to overwrite arbitrary data, leading to control of the program's execution flow and potentially achieving arbitrary code execution.
- Application crash: The vulnerability can cause the application to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- A specially crafted TIFF image: The attacker crafts a malicious TIFF image containing specific parameters to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to deliver the crafted TIFF image to the victim and have it processed by the vulnerable application. This would usually be done through user interaction, such as opening the image in the application.
