  "cveId": "CVE-2018-3957",
  "description": "A use-after-free condition can occur when accessing the `Keywords` property of the `this.info` object. The following code demonstrates this:\n\n```\nfunction main() {\nvar tmp  = this.info;\napp.activeDocs[0].closeDoc();\ntmp['Keywords'].toString();\n}\nmain();\n```\n\nThis results in an access violation when the memory pointed to by `ecx` is dereferenced, which is already freed. If this memory location is placed under attacker control, a double dereference could lead to control over contents of `edx` which is used in a `call` instruction, thus leading to arbitrary code execution.",
  "affectedProducts": [
    "Foxit PDF Reader 9.1.0.5096 and earlier"
  ],
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The application attempts to access memory that has already been freed when accessing the `Keywords` property of the `this.info` object after a document has been closed.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-After-Free"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "A specially crafted PDF document that contains malicious JavaScript code"
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker must trick the user to open the malicious PDF file or, if the browser plugin extension is enabled, visit a malicious website to trigger the vulnerability."
  },
  "additionalNotes": "The vulnerability is triggered by dereferencing memory that has already been freed. This memory is pointed to by the `ecx` register and if this is placed under attacker control, a double dereference can result in the arbitrary code execution."
