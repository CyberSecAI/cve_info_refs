- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper directory permissions in the installer for the Intel(R) Media Server Studio.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The installer creates a directory (`C:\Intel`) with overly permissive default access control lists (ACLs), specifically granting "Authenticated Users" more access than intended.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged local user could leverage this to escalate their privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the system with the vulnerable software installed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have local access to the system and be an authenticated user with the ability to manipulate files and directories.
