- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The NordVPN client uses a service running with system privileges to execute OpenVPN with a configuration file. The client attempts to sanitize the OpenVPN configuration file to prevent command injection by blocking keywords like 'plugin' and 'script-security'. However, the sanitization logic fails to account for characters such as quotation marks which are valid OpenVPN configuration syntax and can be used to bypass the filter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Improper input validation: The NordVPN client's input sanitization logic does not correctly handle special characters, specifically quotes, in the OpenVPN configuration file, allowing an attacker to inject malicious commands.
    - Privilege escalation: The vulnerability allows a low-privileged user to execute commands with system privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with system privileges on the victim's machine. This could lead to a complete system compromise, including data theft, malware installation, or complete denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - The attack vector is a specially crafted OpenVPN configuration file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - An attacker needs to be able to generate an OpenVPN configuration file using a vulnerable version of NordVPN.
    - The attacker needs to be able to trigger the connection process that will use the crafted configuration file.
