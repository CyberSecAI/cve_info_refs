Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-3849:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `ffghtb()` function of the CFITSIO library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The `ffghtb()` function uses `sprintf()` to construct an error message. The input to the `sprintf()` function includes user-controlled data (`value`) from a FITS file header, specifically the `XTENSION` keyword, which is copied into the `message` buffer. When the `XTENSION` value is not “TABLE”, an error message including the value is generated which exceeds the allocated buffer size of `message[81]`.
*   **Unsafe Function:** The use of `sprintf()` is inherently dangerous because it does not perform bounds checking, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input data exceeds the allocated buffer size.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** A successful exploit of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution on the target system due to overwriting of stack memory. This could allow an attacker to take full control of the system or application using the vulnerable CFITSIO library.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious FITS Files:** The attack vector is through specially crafted FITS image files.
*   **File Parsing:** The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of the FITS header when the function `ffghtb()` is called to validate the `XTENSION` keyword.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to supply a malicious FITS file:** The attacker must be able to provide a crafted FITS file to an application or system that uses the vulnerable CFITSIO library. This could involve sending it via network or using it locally on a file system the vulnerable application accesses.
*   **No authentication required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any authentication, provided the application processes the malicious FITS file.
