| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1568189#c0)  Sam Fowler    2018-04-17 00:12:00 UTC  ```  This is an automatically created tracking bug!  It was created to ensure that one or more security vulnerabilities are fixed in affected versions of fedora-all.  For comments that are specific to the vulnerability please use bugs filed against the "Security Response" product referenced in the "Blocks" field.  For more information see: <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/TrackingBugs>  When submitting as an update, use the fedpkg template provided in the next comment(s).  This will include the bug IDs of this tracking bug as well as the relevant top-level CVE bugs.  Please also mention the CVE IDs being fixed in the RPM changelog and the fedpkg commit message.  NOTE: this issue affects multiple supported versions of Fedora. While only one tracking bug has been filed, please correct all affected versions at the same time.  If you need to fix the versions independent of each other, you may clone this bug as appropriate.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1568189#c1)  Sam Fowler    2018-04-17 00:12:04 UTC  ``` Use the following template to for the 'fedpkg update' request to submit an update for this issue as it contains the top-level parent bug(s) as well as this tracking bug.  This will ensure that all associated bugs get updated when new packages are pushed to stable.  =====  # bugfix, security, enhancement, newpackage (required) type=security  # testing, stable request=testing  # Bug numbers: 1234,9876 bugs=1568185,1568189  # Description of your update notes=Security fix for [PUT CVEs HERE]  # Enable request automation based on the stable/unstable karma thresholds autokarma=True stable_karma=3 unstable_karma=-3  # Automatically close bugs when this marked as stable close_bugs=True  # Suggest that users restart after update suggest_reboot=False  ======  Additionally, you may opt to use the bodhi web interface to submit updates:  <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/new>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1568189#c2)  Ben Cotton    2018-11-27 15:18:35 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 27 is nearing its end of life. On 2018-Nov-30  Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 27. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  'version' of '27'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora 27 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora  version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1568189#c3)  Fedora Update System    2019-03-04 14:29:12 UTC  ``` cfitsio-3.430-2.fc28 has been submitted as an update to Fedora 28. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2019-3c1aed2aa9>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1568189#c4)  Fedora Update System    2019-03-05 04:37:43 UTC  ``` cfitsio-3.430-2.fc28 has been pushed to the Fedora 28 testing repository. If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report. See [https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:Updates_Testing](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA%3AUpdates_Testing) for instructions on how to install test updates. You can provide feedback for this update here: <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2019-3c1aed2aa9>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1568189#c5)  Fedora Update System    2019-03-27 03:27:05 UTC  ``` cfitsio-3.430-2.fc28 has been pushed to the Fedora 28 stable repository. If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ``` |  |

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-3c1aed2aa9
2019-03-27 03:26:43.386641
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : cfitsio
Product : Fedora 28
Version : 3.430
Release : 2.fc28
URL : <http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/>
Summary : Library for manipulating FITS data files
Description :
CFITSIO is a library of C and FORTRAN subroutines for reading and writing
data files in FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) data format. CFITSIO
simplifies the task of writing software that deals with FITS files by
providing an easy to use set of high-level routines that insulate the
programmer from the internal complexities of the FITS file format. At the
same time, CFITSIO provides many advanced features that have made it the
most widely used FITS file programming interface in the astronomical
community.

# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2018-0531

## NASA CFITSIO `ffghbn` and `ffghtb` Stack Overflow Code Execution Vulnerabilities

##### April 12, 2018

##### CVE Number

CVE-2018-3848 - CVE-2018-3849

### Summary

Exploitable buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in image parsing functionality of the CFITSIO library version 3.42. Specially crafted images parsed via the library, can cause a stack-based buffer overflow overwriting arbitrary data. An attacker can deliver an FIT image to trigger this vulnerability and potentially gain code execution.

### Tested Versions

NASA CFITSIO 3.42

### Product URLs

<https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/fitsio.html>

### CVSSv3 Score

8.8 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow

### Details

CFITSIO is a library written in C, for reading and writing data files in FITS data format. This format is the standard astronomical data format endorsed by both NASA and the IAU. FITS is primarily designed to store scientific data sets consisting of multi-dimensional arrays and 2-dimensional tables containing rows and columns of data. This software is used extensively and is the primary library used when writing an application to handle the FITS format. Among other things CFITSIO is widely used in ground-based observatories as well as orbiting astronomical observatories in their ground data processing pipeline systems. For more users see, <https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/major_users.html>.

The vulnerabilities arise in the `ffghbn` and ffghtb function.

CVE-2018-3848 - ffghbn

The ffghbn responsible for getting data from a binary table inside a FITS image. This function’s main purpose is to parse the header keywords and validate them to ensure they conform to the FITS standard. The function also returns the necessary data to parse the rest of the table. Below is a look at the function responsible for parsing.

```
int ffghbn

    char name[FLEN_KEYWORD], value[FLEN_VALUE], comm[FLEN_COMMENT];  [0]
    char message[81];

    /* read the first keyword of the extension */
    ffgkyn(fptr, 1, name, value, comm, status);                         [1]

    if (!strcmp(name, "XTENSION"))
    {
            if (ffc2s(value, xtension, status) > 0)  /* get the value string */
            {

            if ( (value[0] != '\'')   ||  /* first char must be a quote */    [2]
                 ( strcmp(xtension, "BINTABLE") &&
                   strcmp(xtension, "A3DTABLE") &&
                   strcmp(xtension, "3DTABLE")
                 ) )
            {
                sprintf(message,
                "This is not a BINTABLE extension: %s", value);                [3]
                ffpmsg(message);
                return(*status = NOT_BTABLE);
            }
    }

```

Location 0 defines the buffer variables used throughout the function. At 3, we see the function read in the keyword directly from the header. This value is then compared with the expected value, 2, and if it does not match we fall into the if statement. There is then a vulnerable call to the function sprintf, 3. Looking at the sprintf manual page it states,

```
 The sprintf() functions are easily misused in a manner which enables malicious users to arbitrarily change
 a running program's functionality through a buffer overflow attack.  Because sprintf() assume an infinite-
 ly long string, callers must be careful not to overflow the actual space; this is often hard to assure.  For safety, programmers should use the snprintf() interface instead.

```

Due to the lack of bounds checking as stated above this call will cause a buffer overflow. The name parameter is taken directly from the user and although restricted in size to 75 bytes at 0, the added error message makes it longer than the 81 bytes of available space in the buffer. This causes an exploitable stack based buffer overflow.

CVE-2018-3849 - ffghtb

This vulnerability is similar to the vulnerability discussed in CVE-2018-3848. This instance occurs in the `ffghtb` function responsible for the parsing of an ascii table inside a FITS image.

```
int ffghtb(

char name[FLEN_KEYWORD], value[FLEN_VALUE], comm[FLEN_COMMENT];        [4]
char xtension[FLEN_VALUE], message[81];

/* read the first keyword of the extension */
ffgkyn(fptr, 1, name, value, comm, status);                              [5]

if (!strcmp(name, "XTENSION"))
{
        if (ffc2s(value, xtension, status) > 0)
        {

        if ( (value[0] != '\'')   ||  /* first char must be a quote */    [6]
             ( strcmp(xtension, "TABLE") ) )
        {
            sprintf(message,
            "This is not a TABLE extension: %s", value);                  [7]
            ffpmsg(message);
            return(*status = NOT_ATABLE);
        }
}

```

The same vulnerable pattern as above is present. The buffers are defined at 4 and at location 5 the value is read in from the image. Location 6 compares the value for validity and if the check fails it falls into the vulnerable sprintf call, 7.
