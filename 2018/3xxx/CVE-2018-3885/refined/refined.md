Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-3885:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the ERPNext application. Specifically, the `order_by` parameter in a GET request is directly incorporated into an SQL query without adequate validation or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is SQL Injection (CWE-89). The application fails to neutralize special elements used in an SQL command, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to:
*   Data compromise: Attackers can potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive data stored in the application's database.
*   Information disclosure: Attackers can extract confidential information from the database.
*   Potential for further attacks: Exploiting the database could provide an attacker with a foothold to escalate their privileges or launch further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is a specially crafted GET request containing a malicious SQL injection payload within the `order_by` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the vulnerable parts of the application.
*   The attacker can use a web browser to craft the request and send it to the server. No special tools are needed.

**Technical Details:**
The specific vulnerable parameter is `order_by` in the following GET request:

```
GET /?start=0&page_length=20&doctype=Customer&fields=[%22%60tabCustomer%60.%60name%60%22%2c%22%60tabCustomer%60.%60owner%60%22%2c%22%60tabCustomer%60.%60docstatus%60%22%2c%22%60tabCustomer%60.%60_user_tags%60%22%2c%22%60tabCustomer%60.%60_comments%60%22%2c%22%60tabCustomer%60.%60modified%60%22%2c%22%60tabCustomer%60.%60modified_by%60%22%2c%22%60tabCustomer%60.%60_assign%60%22%2c%22%60tabCustomer%60.%60_liked_by%60%22%2c%22%60tabCustomer%60.%60_seen%60%22%2c%22%60tabCustomer%60.%60customer_name%60%22%2c%22%60tabCustomer%60.%60image%60%22%2c%22%60tabCustomer%60.%60disabled%60%22%2c%22%60tabCustomer%60.%60customer_group%60%22%2c%22%60tabCustomer%60.%60territory%60%22%2c%22%60tabCustomer%60.%60customer_type%60%22]&filters=%5B%5D&order_by=<SQLINJECTION>&with_comment_count=true&user_settings=%7B%22updated_on%22%3A%22Tue+Mar+27+2018+01%3A08%3A06+GMT%2B0100%22%2C%22List%22%3A%7B%22filters%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22order_by%22%3A%22%60tabCustomer%60.%60modified%60+desc%22%7D%2C%22last_view%22%3A%22List%22%7D&cmd=frappe.desk.reportview.get&_=1522108874124 HTTP/1.1
