- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the way Atlantis Word Processor handles table information within a Word document. Specifically, when parsing a document, the application uses a field from the `Fib` to determine the stream containing table information (either “1Table” or “0Table”).  The application reads an offset to the CLX array and its size from the `Fib` to locate this array. If the CLX array size is smaller than a multiple of the size of each individual element, when an individual piece is compressed, the application recalculates the character position and writes it back into the array. This new character position will be written outside the bounds of the array leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.

    A more specific root cause is in how the application initializes a `TList` containing `TTableRow` objects. Due to a missing or corrupted property, the `TList` remains empty, leading to an attempt to access an uninitialized pointer when trying to fetch the first element of this empty list.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Heap-based buffer overflow due to writing outside the bounds of the CLX array when processing compressed table data.
    - Use of an uninitialized pointer, which occurs when attempting to access the first element of an empty `TList` of `TTableRow` objects

- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to heap memory corruption, resulting in arbitrary code execution under the context of the application.

- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a specially crafted Word document.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to convince the victim to open a specially crafted document with the vulnerable Atlantis Word Processor. No special capabilities or network position are required besides having the victim open the file.
