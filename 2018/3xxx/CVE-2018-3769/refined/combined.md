When calling into an API specifying a crafted format that is HTML,

the returned error renders the HTML back to the user, causing a potential XSS

issue. For example:

<http://example.com/api/endpoint?format=%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E>

Renders as html:

The requested format '<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>' is not supported.

When an error generates html back to the user, make sure it's properly escaped.

Fixes issue [#1762](https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape/issues/1762)

| I had to fix six specs to be "compliant", which really surprised me. The ones that return json in particular seem like maybe they're not setting their content-type appropriately to json and as such are returning a json blob in html code. Is this ok/correct? |

| The ones that expect JSON should indeed set the correct content type, thanks for taking care of it.  Looks like Rails 3 may be a problem. If it gets complicated we can discuss dropping support. |

| 👋 I am a member of the GitHub team that sends security alerts. This issue was assigned [CVE-2018-3769](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-3769) which is now disclosed publicly therefore therefore we would like to send security alerts for it.  However, in our curation process it was noticed that the latest version of `grape`, `1.0.3`, does not appear to include this fix. Will a new version of grape be published soon with this fix?  Thank you for any information! 🙇 |

| I wonder why JSON error responses get escaped as well, and even specs are aligned to do that. That breaks existing JSON apis, since json doesn't understand " instead of "  I have such code:  ```     content_type :json, 'application/json'     default_format :json      rescue_from Grape::Knock::ForbiddenError do       error!({ error: :unauthenticated }, 401)     end ```  and it returns `"{&quot;error&quot;:&quot;unauthenticated&quot;}` instead of normal JSON |

## Commit

[Permalink](/ruby-grape/grape/commit/6876b71efc7b03f7ce1be3f075eaa4e7e6de19af)

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

When returning an HTML error, make sure it's safe ([#1763](https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape/pull/1763))

```
* When calling into an API specifying a crafted format that is HTML,
the returned error renders the HTML back to the user, causing a potential XSS
issue.  For example:

<http://example.com/api/endpoint?format=%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E>

Renders as html:

The requested format '<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>' is not supported.

When an error generates html back to the user, make sure it's properly escaped.

Fixes issue [#1762](https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape/issues/1762)

* Add changelog entry

* Use a method that also works in rails3

* Add spec formatting for older rails/activesupport version
```

## Description

[![@ctennis](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114?v=4&size=48)](/ctennis)[ctennis](https://github.com/ctennis)opened [on May 22, 2018](https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape/issues/1762#issue-325485128)

If you issue a request into an API endpoint with a format specified that is not handled, you get back a 406 error with message 'The requested format 'format' is not supported.'

The name of the specified format is rendered in the error message, which defaults as HTML. You can easily craft a format value that gets passed in and renders as an XSS. An example:

<http://example.com/api/endpoint?format=%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E>

Renders as html:

The requested format '<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>' is not supported.

Which will cause a javascript popup if you visit this page in a browser.
