- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Insteon Hub's firmware allows uploading of arbitrary MPFS (Microchip Proprietary File System) binaries through the `/mpfsupload` HTTP endpoint. This uploaded MPFS image can be crafted to include a "firmware.htm" file. Subsequently, a POST request to the "firmware.htm" endpoint initiates a firmware update using the data provided in the POST body, with no signature verification.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Unrestricted MPFS Upload:** The device allows uploading arbitrary MPFS binaries, which are used to store web resources for the deviceâ€™s HTTP server.
    - **Missing Signature Verification:** The firmware update process doesn't verify the signature or integrity of the firmware image, allowing any modified firmware to be flashed.
    - **Leftover Debug Code:** The `/mpfsupload` functionality, typically used for debugging and development purposes, was not disabled in the production firmware.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can upload a malicious MPFS file to enable the "firmware.htm" endpoint, and then upload a malicious firmware image to overwrite the device's legitimate firmware. This allows for full control over the device, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code, steal sensitive information, or cause a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - **HTTP Interface:** The attack is performed via HTTP requests to the device's web server.
    - **MPFS Upload:** Initial access is gained via the `/mpfsupload` endpoint to upload a crafted MPFS image.
    - **Firmware Update:** The modified firmware is uploaded through the crafted `firmware.htm` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the Insteon Hub or have network access to it.
    - **Authentication Credentials:** The attacker needs to know the basic authentication username and password to access the HTTP interface of the device.
    - **Crafted MPFS and Firmware:** The attacker needs to be able to create the malicious MPFS binary and a modified firmware image.
