Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-3898:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `trans_info` function of the Yi Home Camera 27US firmware. This function is used to parse data extracted from a scanned QR code during the camera's network configuration.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unbounded `sscanf`**: The `trans_info` function uses `sscanf` with a format string (`%[^\"',};&]`) to copy the values of parameters from the QR code data, specifically SSID and password. This `sscanf` is not length-limited, so if the input data is longer than the destination buffer, it will overflow the buffer.
- **Stack-Based Buffer Overflow:** The destination buffers for SSID and password are located on the stack, which means overflowing these buffers can overwrite the return address, leading to code execution.
- **Insufficient Input Validation**: The application fails to properly validate the length of the data read from the QR code before copying it to the stack buffers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** By overflowing the return address on the stack, an attacker can redirect program execution to an arbitrary location, allowing them to execute malicious code on the camera. This could lead to complete compromise of the device, allowing an attacker to control the camera, access network resources, and potentially use it in a botnet.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious QR Code:** An attacker can generate a malicious QR code containing an overly long SSID or password field.
- **QR Code Display:** A user could be tricked into scanning a malicious QR code from a website or other untrusted source.
- **Camera Scan Trigger:** The camera can be tricked into scanning a malicious QR code without user interaction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Generate QR Codes:** The attacker needs to generate a QR code with the specially crafted input.
- **Physical or Visual Access:** The attacker needs a way to get the camera to scan the malicious QR code. This can either be direct physical access or convincing the user to display it to the camera.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Software:** The attacker needs to know about the vulnerability in the Yi Home Camera 27US 1.8.7.0D.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the camera parses the `&s=` parameter in the QR code, overflowing the `ssid_dst` buffer. A similar vulnerability, CVE-2018-3899, is present when parsing the `&p=` parameter.
- The vulnerability is due to the combination of using `sscanf` to copy data and the lack of length limits on the stack allocated buffers.
- The provided crash information shows the program crashing at an address controlled by the attacker (0x41414140, the ASCII representation of "AAAA").
