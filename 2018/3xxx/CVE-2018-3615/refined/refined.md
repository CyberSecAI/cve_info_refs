    "description": "The L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF) vulnerability, also known as Foreshadow, is a speculative execution side-channel attack that allows an attacker with local user access to potentially disclose information residing in the L1 data cache from an IntelÂ® SGX enclave. This vulnerability was independently discovered by two teams, one at imec-DistriNet, KU Leuven and another at Technion, University of Michigan, University of Adelaide and CSIRO's Data61. The attack exploits a vulnerability in Intel processors, allowing the extraction of data from SGX-protected memory. The original Foreshadow attack targets SGX enclaves, but it was found that similar attacks can be performed to retrieve information from other memory areas.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from speculative execution and L1 data cache handling in Intel processors. Specifically, during speculative execution, when a processor attempts to access memory, the logical memory address is translated to a physical address. When a logical address has no mapping, a terminal fault occurs, but during a short window before resolution, the processor might speculatively access the L1 data cache using potentially leaked data, leading to information disclosure.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Speculative execution side-channel vulnerability",
      "L1 data cache information disclosure",
       "Memory access using unmapped memory addresses.",
       "Transient out-of-order execution",
       "Cache timing side-channel attack."
      
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to read the contents of memory protected by Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX) enclaves, as well as other privileged memory regions. This can lead to unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including cryptographic keys, user data, and other secrets stored in these protected memory areas. It also has the potential to erode the trust in the SGX attestation process.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to the system.",
        "Execution of crafted code on the target system."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs local user access to the system. They need the ability to execute code or scripts. In some scenarios, access to virtual machines or guest OS is required."
