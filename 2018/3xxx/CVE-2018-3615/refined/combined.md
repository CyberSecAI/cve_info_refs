"**[Telephone](/wiki/Telephone_%28song%29 "Telephone (song)")**" is a song by [Lady Gaga](/wiki/Lady_Gaga "Lady Gaga") featuring [Beyoncé](/wiki/Beyonc%C3%A9 "Beyoncé") *(both pictured)* and released on January 26, 2010. "Telephone" conveys Gaga's fear of not finding time for fun given the increasing pressure for her to work harder. The song consists of an expanded [bridge](/wiki/Bridge_%28music%29 "Bridge (music)") and [verse-rap](/wiki/Verse%E2%80%93chorus_form "Verse–chorus form"); Beyoncé appears in the middle of the song, singing the verses in a "rapid-fire" way, accompanied by double beats. "Telephone" received positive reviews from critics who praised Gaga's chemistry with Beyoncé. It was nominated for a [Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals](/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Pop_Collaboration_with_Vocals "Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals"). The song charted in many countries and sold 7.4 million [digital copies](/wiki/Music_download "Music download") worldwide in 2010, making it [the year's fourth best-selling single](/wiki/List_of_best-selling_singles#Best-selling_singles_by_year_worldwide "List of best-selling singles"). The music video follows Beyoncé as she bails Gaga out of prison for killing her boyfriend and ends with the two trying to escape a high-speed police chase. The video received generally positive reviews and was nominated for three awards at the [2010 MTV Video Music Awards](/wiki/2010_MTV_Video_Music_Awards "2010 MTV Video Music Awards").

| --- |
| **[Shinku La](/wiki/Shinku_La "Shinku La")** is a [mountain pass](/wiki/Mountain_pass "Mountain pass") in the [Himalayas](/wiki/Himalayas "Himalayas") of northern India. The pass is traversed by the [Darcha–Padum road](/wiki/Nimmu%E2%80%93Padum%E2%80%93Darcha_road "Nimmu–Padum–Darcha road"), connecting the high-altitude region of [Zanskar](/wiki/Zanskar "Zanskar") in [Ladakh](/wiki/Ladakh "Ladakh") with the rest of India. The pass becomes snowbound in the winter, leading to the closure of the road. The construction of a tunnel under the pass, to ensure all-weather connectivity, began in 2024. This photograph shows Shinku La covered in snow, with a frozen lake in the foreground.

### Affected Processors: Guidance for Security Issues on Intel® Processors

This table shows the impact of transient execution attacks and select security issues on currently supported Intel® products, including recommended mitigation where affected. Processors that have met the End-of-Servicing-Lifetime (EOSL) milestone may not be listed in the following table and mitigation status of EOSL processors may not be evaluated. More information on processors that are no longer supported and are not listed in the following table can be found in [Support](/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000022396/processors.html).

Some processors may have extended servicing, which is servicing provided after broad market servicing concludes. Extended servicing is available to customers who have extended servicing agreements with Intel. Intel does not have extended servicing for all processors. For customers interested in extended servicing, contact your Intel representative.

This table lists processors by product family. For specific product names, see [Product Specifications](http://ark.intel.com/ " "). For specific mitigation information, select the associated guidance from Intel that's linked in the table header. To view all issues, use the following scrollbars and table tabs.  A .csv version of this table is also available on [GitHub\*](https://github.com/intel/Intel-affected-processor-list " ").

## Key

**Software**: Mitigation implemented in software, and software updates needed to enable mitigation

**MCU**: Mitigation requires microcode update; it is runtime effective

**BIOS**: BIOS code change needed

**Hardware + MCU**: Mitigation implemented in hardware; microcode update is also required

**Hardware + Software**: Mitigation implemented in hardware; software updates required or needed for enablement

**MCU + Software**: Mitigation requires microcode update; software updates required or needed for enablement

**MCU\_BIOS**: Mitigation requires microcode update loaded by BIOS to be effective

**MCU\_BIOS + BIOS**: Mitigation requires microcode update loaded by BIOS, and BIOS code change needed

**Not Affected**: Products not affected or mitigated through hardware; may not include enumeration for security vulnerabilities

**No Planned Mitigation**: Issue exists but no mitigation planned

**Note** The latest software can be obtained through operating system or VMM vendors

## Footnotes

1.     CPUID description: Example CPUID = 906EB. Family = 06 / Extended Model = 9 / Model Number = E / Stepping ID = B. See Intel® Software Developer’s Manual v071, Volume 2A, Figure 3-6 for reference

2.     Intel recommends ensuring all security mitigations provided by Intel are applied and systems are running the latest firmware/MCU versions available. MCU updates may still be required for enumeration even when processors are not affected. Contact OS/VMM vendors for the latest software updates.

Linux\* Users: The microcode image is named after the family/model/stepping. You can locate these from /proc/cpuinfo. Example: For Family 06, Model 85, Stepping 4 (values in decimal), the corresponding microcode file is 06-55-04 located in /lib/firmware/intel-ucode/ (values in hexadecimal).

Look at the microcode version number at the [official public Intel microcode website](https://github.com/intel/Intel-Linux-Processor-Microcode-Data-Files/tree/main/intel-ucode). Calculate Family-Model-Stepping before downloading the appropriate microcode.
 Windows users: Read the version with the following PowerShell command: reg query HKLM\HARDWARE\DESCRIPTION\System\CentralProcessor\0 /v "Update Revision".
 Or use the [Intel® Processor Identification Utility tool](/content/www/us/en/support/products/5982/processors/processor-utilities-and-programs/intel-processor-identification-utility.html) to check the microcode version and compare it against the latest microcode listed above.

For more information on finding microcode versions, see [How to Find the Microcode Version Currently Running on Your Processor](/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000055672/processors.html).

For more information on Intel processor numbering, see [A Brief Guide to Our Latest Processor and Naming Updates](/content/www/us/en/processors/processor-numbers.html).

3.     This column describes mitigations for RDMSR at CPL3 and RDMSR in a Virtual Machine Extensions (VMX) guest when the VMM indicates that MSR should cause a VM exit. See the [Intel Guidance](/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/best-practices/microcode-update-guidance.html) for more details on other aspects of v3a.

4.     Options may include: process isolation, masking, speculative load hardening, or LFENCE insertion, as well as SYSRET or dedicated type, set FTZ, and DAZ. See [Intel Guidance](/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/best-practices/microcode-update-guidance.html) for more detail.

5.     Software tools for Intel® Software Guard Extensions (Intel® SGX); only if Intel SGX is supported.

6.     Intel is not aware of any real-world impact outside Intel SGX and is only releasing mitigations for Intel SGX software. Software mitigation outside of Intel SGX may be possible. See [Intel Guidance](/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/best-practices/microcode-update-guidance.html) for additional information.

7.     See [Intel Guidance](/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/best-practices/microcode-update-guidance.html) for more information.

8.     Intel is not planning mitigations as these products are discontinued or no longer supported.

9.     Existing Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS) mitigations provided in IPU 2019.1 help mitigate against MMIO; there are no new MMIO-specific MCU mitigations for this processor. Intel recommends applying the latest Intel security mitigations and ensuring systems are running the latest firmware/MCU versions available.

10.  There is no change in the IPU 2022.1 MCU for these products. The mitigation uses MDS mitigations provided in IPU 2019.1. Intel recommends applying all security mitigations provided by Intel and ensuring your systems are running the latest firmware/MCU versions available from Intel.

11.  These processors are affected because of the impact to Intel SGX. See the Intel Guidance for more information.

12.  This product has reached its End of Servicing Update (ESU) date. See our [Support webpage](/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000022396/processors.html " ") for further information. For customers interested in extending updates beyond ESU, contact your Intel representative for details.

## Introduction

Foreshadow is a speculative execution attack on Intel processors
which allows an attacker to steal sensitive information stored inside personal computers or third party
clouds. Foreshadow has two versions, the original attack designed to extract data from SGX enclaves and a Next-Generation version which affects
Virtual Machines (VMs), hypervisors (VMM), operating system (OS) kernel memory, and System Management Mode (SMM) memory.

### Foreshadow

At a high level, [SGX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Guard_Extensions)
is a new feature in modern Intel CPUs which
allows computers to protect users’ data even if the entire system falls under
the attacker’s control. While it was previously believed that SGX is resilient
to speculative execution attacks (such as [Meltdown](https://meltdownattack.com/) and [Spectre](https://spectreattack.com/)), Foreshadow
demonstrates how speculative execution can be exploited for reading the
contents of SGX-protected memory as well as extracting the machine’s private attestation key.
Making things worse, due to SGX’s privacy features, an attestation report cannot be linked to the identity of its signer.
Thus, it only takes a single compromised SGX machine to erode trust in the
entire SGX ecosystem.

### Foreshadow – Next Generation (NG)

While investigating the vulnerability that causes Foreshadow, which
Intel refers to as "L1 Terminal Fault",
Intel identified two related
attacks, which we call Foreshadow-NG.
These attacks can potentially be used to read  **any** information residing in the L1 cache, including
information belonging to the System Management Mode (SMM), the
[Operating System's Kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_%28operating_system%29), or [Hypervisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor). Perhaps most devastating, Foreshadow-NG might also be used to read information stored in other virtual machines running on the same third-party cloud, presenting a risk to cloud infrastructure. Finally, in some cases, Foreshadow-NG might bypass previous mitigations against speculative execution attacks, including countermeasures for [Meltdown](https://meltdownattack.com/) and [Spectre](https://spectreattack.com/).

## Foreshadow in Action (Attacking SGX)

## Questions and Answers

Who reported this vulnerability?

Foreshadow was independently and concurrently discovered by two teams:

* [Jo Van Bulck](https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/people/jo),
  [Frank Piessens](https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/people/frank),
  [Raoul Strackx](https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/people/raoul)
  ([imec-DistriNet, KU Leuven](https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/)).
* [Marina Minkin](https://themarina.github.io/),
  [Mark Silberstein](https://sites.google.com/site/silbersteinmark/)
  ([Technion](https://www.technion.ac.il/en)),
  [Ofir Weisse](http://www.ofirweisse.com/),
  [Daniel Genkin](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~genkin/),
  [Baris Kasikci](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~barisk/),
  [Thomas F. Wenisch](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~twenisch/)
  ([University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu/)),
  [Yuval Yarom](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/directory/yuval.yarom)
  ([University of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/) and
  [CSIRO's Data61](https://data61.csiro.au)).

The KU Leuven authors discovered the vulnerability, independently
developed the attack, and first notified Intel on January 3, 2018.
Their work was done independently from and concurrently to other recent
x86 speculative execution vulnerabilities, notably Meltdown and
Spectre.

The authors from Technion, University of Michigan, the
University of Adelaide and CSIRO's Data61 independently discovered and reported the
vulnerability and associated attack to Intel during the embargo period on
January 23, 2018.

Following our discovery of Foreshadow (CVE-2018-3615), Intel identified two closely related variants, potentially affecting additional microprocessors, SMM code, Operating system and Hypervisor software. We collectively refer to these Intel-discovered variants as Foreshadow-NG (Next Generation, CVE-2018-3620 and CVE-2018-3646), whereas Intel refers to this entire class of speculative execution side channel vulnerabilities as “L1 Terminal Fault" (L1TF). More information on L1TF can be found [here](https://software.intel.com/security-software-guidance/software-guidance/l1-terminal-fault).

What technologies are affected by Foreshadow?

The researchers who discovered Foreshadow demonstrated the
vulnerability on [SGX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Guard_Extensions)
enclaves, extracting any data protected via SGX secure memory.

What technologies are affected by Foreshadow-NG?

Foreshadow-NG can be used for extracting  **any**  information
residing in the L1 cache, including information belonging to the [System Management
Mode (SMM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Management_Mode), the
[Operating System's (OS) Kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_%28operating_system%29), or other  [Virtual Machines (VMs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine)  running on third-party clouds. More technically, Foreshadow-NG allows the following:

* A user processes can potentially read kernel memory belonging to the OS.
* A malicious guest VM (running on the cloud) can potentially read memory belonging to the VM's hypervisor or memory belonging to another guest VM running on the cloud.
* A malicious OS to read memory protected by the SMM.

Where can I find more information about Foreshadow and Foreshadow-NG?

For more information about how the attack works see our [academic paper](foreshadow.pdf).
[Intel's security advisory](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00161.html) and [whitepaper](https://software.intel.com/security-software-guidance/software-guidance/l1-terminal-fault), describing Foreshadow as 'L1 Terminal Fault', are also available. The Foreshadow / L1-terminal-fault attack were assigned the following CVE numbers:

* CVE-2018-3615 for attacking SGX.
* CVE-2018-3620 for attacking the OS Kernel and SMM mode.
* CVE-2018-3646 for attacking virtual machines.

What is a virtual machine?

A
 [Virtual Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) is a software emulator of a physical computer. Virtual machines are often used in compute clouds (such as [Amazon's AWS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services) or [Microsoft's Azure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure)) where, instead of maintaining their own infrastructure, customers can pay for the time the cloud infrastructure spends on running the customer's machine (and the computations within it). As clouds typically run more than one virtual machine on the same physical hardware, it is important that the cloud's Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) or hypervisor prevents information leakage across VM boundaries by ensuring complete isolation between two virtual machines and between the virtual machines and the hypervisor.

So how does Foreshadow-NG affect VMs?

Foreshadow-NG breaks the above mentioned isolation. Thus, a malicious virtual machine running inside the cloud can potentially read data belonging to other virtual machines as well as data belonging to the cloud's hypervisor.

What is an operating system kernel?

The [operating
system kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_%28operating_system%29) is the core of the operating system, and is
responsible for managing most of the operations that a computer performs.
In particular, the kernel manages the computer's memory and CPU time as
well as ensures isolation between two programs running on the same
computer. Given its important role, the kernel has access to all the data
stored in the computer's memory, including data belonging to other
programs.

So how does Foreshadow-NG affect the kernel?

Using Foreshadow-NG, a malicious program running on the computer might be able to read some parts of the kernel's data. As the kernel has access to data stored by other programs, a malicious program might be able
to exploit Foreshadow-NG to access data belonging to other programs.

What is Intel SGX?

[Intel Software Guard eXtensions (SGX)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Guard_Extensions)
is a Trusted Execution Environment
(TEE) that enables secure program execution in untrusted environments. The program
and the data it operates on, are placed inside a secure enclave. There they are protected from modification or inspection, even
in the presence of a highly-privileged adversary corrupting the operating system, hypervisor, or firmware (BIOS). SGX also provides a remote attestation protocol that allows software to prove to a remote party that it is running on a genuine SGX-enabled Intel processor, as opposed to a (potentially malicious) simulator.

Was the confidentiality of SGX enclaves affected by Foreshadow?

Yes. Foreshadow enables an attacker to read the entire SGX enclave's memory contents.
This includes architectural enclaves provided
by Intel such as the Quoting and Launch Enclaves.

Was the remote attestation protocol affected by Foreshadow?

Yes. Using Foreshadow we have successfully extracted the attestation keys, used by the Intel
Quoting Enclave to vouch for the authenticity of enclaves. As a result, we
were able to generate "valid" attestation quotes. Using these counterfeit quotes,
successfully "proved" to a remote party that a "genuine" enclave was running while, in fact,
the code was running outside of SGX, under our complete control.

Is SGX long-term storage affected by Foreshadow?

Yes. As Foreshadow enables an attacker to extract SGX sealing keys, previously sealed data can be modified and re-sealed. With the extracted sealing key, an attacker can trivially calculate a valid Message Authentication Code (MAC), thus depriving the data owner from the ability to detect the modification.

Can I detect if someone has exploited Foreshadow to read my data?

Not likely. Foreshadow does not leave traces in typical log files.
While installing a new (malicious) driver may leave traces in the system log,
the attacker can probably alter the log buffer, since she has root privileges.

A kernel-level attacker using a Foreshadow attack may apply tricks to significantly increase her chances of success.
While installing a new (malicious) driver may leave traces in the system log,
such a privileged attacker can probably alter the log afterwards.

What about other processors (AMD/ARM)?

The original Foreshadow attack affects most SGX-enabled Intel processors. As SGX is currently
present only in Intel CPUs, we are unaware of Foreshadow affecting other CPU
vendors. To the best of our understanding, Foreshadow-NG only affects Intel processors. However, we are still working to better understand the implications of Foreshadow-NG and this answer might change as the situation develops.

Did you release the source code of your exploits?

For educational purposes, we integrated basic support for Foreshadow-type
transient execution attacks into the open-source SGX-Step enclave
side-channel attack framework available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/jovanbulck/sgx-step/tree/master/app/foreshadow).

Are there mitigations against Foreshadow?

Foreshadow and Foreshadow-NG require mitigations at the both software and microcode level. This includes updates to most operating systems, hypervisors as well as CPU microcode updates. See
[Intel's security advisory](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00161.html) and our [technical report](foreshadow-NG.pdf) for additional details.

Have you evaluated any software or microcode updates?

We are currently still evaluating microcode and software patches but have not discovered any vulnerabilities. For technical experts, our technical report discusses our view on these mitigations in more detail.

Do Spectre and Meltdown mitigations such as Retpoline,
KPTI,
IBRS,
STIBP, or
IBPB
mitigate Foreshadow?

No. The mitigations against Meltdown and Spectre are not effective against Foreshadow and Foreshadow-NG.

How is Foreshadow different from Meltdown?

Foreshadow is different from Meltdown as it targets virtual machines and SGX in addition to data stored in the operating system's kernel (which was targeted by Meltdown). While harder to exploit, Foreshadow is effective against systems deploying Kernel Page Table Isolation (KPTI), which stops Meltdown attacks.

How is Foreshadow different from prior Spectre-like attacks on SGX?

Concurrent speculative execution attacks on SGX, e.g., [SGXPectre](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09085),
rely on the code of the affected enclave to contain gadgets vulnerable to
Spectre. Thus, such attacks can be theoretically mitigated
by removing these gadgets from the affected enclave. In contrast, Foreshadow
extracts enclave memory without relying on *any* code vulnerability in
the victim enclave or even without requiring the affected enclave to execute.
As such, Foreshadow can be used even in the case where the code of the affected
enclave is "perfect", i.e., does not contain any side-channel vulnerability.

What CPUs are affected by Foreshadow and Foreshadow-NG?

Intel confirmed that Foreshadow affects all SGX-enabled Core processors
(Skylake and Kaby Lake), while Atom family processors with SGX support
remain unaffected. Intel confirmed that Foreshadow-NG affects the following processes:

* Intel Core™ i3/i5/i7/M processor (45nm and 32nm)
* 2nd/3rd/4th/5th/6th/7th/8th generation Intel Core processors
* Intel Core X-series Processor Family for Intel X99 and X299 platforms
* Intel Xeon processor 3400/3600/5500/5600/6500/7500 series
* Intel Xeon Processor E3 v1/v2/v3/v4/v5/v6 Family
* Intel® Xeon® Processor E5 v1/v2/v3/v4 Family
* Intel® Xeon® Processor E7 v1/v2/v3/v4 Family
* Intel® Xeon® Processor Scalable Family
* Intel® Xeon® Processor D (1500, 2100)

See
[Intel's security advisory](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00161.html) for additional details.

Why is it called Foreshadow?

In literature, ["foreshadowing"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreshadowing)
is used to indicate a trick where a writer provides a subtle hint of
what is to come later in the story. Analogous to how a good story teller
tries to keep the outcome of the story (mostly) secret, the speculative
execution mechanisms found in modern processors, do not *directly*
leak secrets. In the storytelling analogy,
the Foreshadow attack shows, however, that
clever adversaries can abuse subtle hints in the present to reconstruct
secrets from future instructions.

| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCPU Side-Channel Information Disclosure Vulnerabilities: August 2018 Medium   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20180814-cpusidechannel  First Published: 2018 August 14 17:00 GMT  Last Updated:  2018 August 31 20:37 GMT  Version 1.5:  [Interim](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#interim)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  CVE-2018-3615 CVE-2018-3620 CVE-2018-3646           CVE-2018-3615 CVE-2018-3620 CVE-2018-3646        [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180814-cpusidechannel/csaf/cisco-sa-20180814-cpusidechannel.json)   Email      Summary  * 5On August 14th, 2018, three vulnerabilities were disclosed by Intel and security researchers that leverage a speculative execution side-channel method referred to as *L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF)* that affects modern Intel microprocessors. These vulnerabilities could allow an unprivileged, local attacker, in specific circumstances, to read privileged memory belonging to other processes. The first vulnerability, CVE-2018-3615, affects Intel SGX technology and is referred to by the researchers who discovered it as *foreshadow.* This vulnerability is not known to affect any Cisco devices as the Cisco devices do not utilize Intel SGX technology.  The second vulnerability, CVE-2018-3620, and the third vulnerability, CVE-2018-3646, are referred to as *L1 Terminal Fault* attacks by Intel. These two vulnerabilities affect multi-core processors that leverage Intel Hyper-Threading technology supporting Operating System, System Management Mode, and Virtualized workloads. Like the previously disclosed Spectre vulnerabilities, all three new vulnerabilities leverage cache-timing attacks to infer any disclosed data.  To exploit any of these vulnerabilities, an attacker must be able to run crafted or script code on an affected device. Although the underlying CPU and operating system combination in a product or service may be affected by these vulnerabilities, the majority of Cisco products are closed systems that do not allow customers to run custom code and are, therefore, not vulnerable. There is no vector from which to exploit them. Cisco products are considered potentially vulnerable only if they allow customers to execute custom code side-by-side with Cisco code on the same microprocessor.      A Cisco product that may be deployed as a virtual machine or a container, even while not directly affected by any of these vulnerabilities, could be targeted by such attacks if the hosting environment is vulnerable. Cisco recommends that customers harden their virtual environments, tightly control user access, and ensure that all security updates are installed. Customers who are deploying products as a virtual device in multi-tenant hosting environments should ensure that the underlying hardware, as well as the operating system or hypervisor, is patched against the vulnerabilities in question.      Although Cisco cloud services are not directly affected by these vulnerabilities, the infrastructure on which they run may be impacted. See the [Affected Products](#ap) section of this advisory for information about the impact of these vulnerabilities on Cisco cloud services.       Cisco will release software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.      This advisory is available at the following link:   <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180814-cpusidechannel>  Affected Products  * Any product or service not listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory is to be considered not vulnerable. The criteria for considering whether a product is vulnerable is explained in the [Summary](#sum) section of this advisory.  Because this is an ongoing investigation, please be aware that products and services currently considered not vulnerable may subsequently be considered vulnerable as additional information becomes available.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• As a prerequisite for an attack, an attacker must be able to run untrusted code on affected systems.
Therefore, Siemens recommends determining if it is possible that untrusted code can be run
on these systems, or if existing measures implemented by the operator reduce the likelihood of
untrusted code being run.

Siemens recommends limiting the possibilities to run untrusted code if possible.

• Applying a Defense-in-Depth concept can help to reduce the probability that untrusted code is run
on the system. Siemens recommends to apply the Defense-in-Depth concept: https://www.siemens.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

# Resources and Response to Side Channel L1 Terminal Fault

## Overview

On August 14, 2018, [Intel and industry partners shared](https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/protecting-our-customers-through-lifecycle-security-threats/) more details and mitigation information about a recently identified speculative execution side-channel method called L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF).

L1TF is a speculative execution side channel cache timing vulnerability. In this regard, it is similar to previously reported variants. There are three varieties of L1TF that have been identified. Each variety of L1TF could potentially allow unauthorized disclosure of information residing in the L1 data cache, a small pool of memory within each processor core designed to store information about what the processor core is most likely to do next.

The microcode updates released earlier this year when coupled with operating system and hypervisor software available from our industry partners, ensure consumers, IT professionals and cloud service providers have access to the protections they need. Intel recommends people keep their systems up to date to protect against the evolving threat landscape.

For the latest Intel security news, please visit [security newsroom](https://newsroom.intel.com/category/security/).

For all others, visit the [Intel Security Center](/content/www/us/en/security-center/default.html) for the latest security information.

L1TF is a highly sophisticated attack method, and today, Intel is not aware of any reported real-world exploits.

## Protecting your Systems

Once systems are updated, the expected risk to consumer and enterprise users running non-virtualized operating systems will be low. This includes most of the data center installed base and the vast majority of PC clients. In these cases, there has been no meaningful performance impact observed as a result of mitigations applied. For a portion of the market – specifically a subset of those running traditional virtualization technology, and primarily in the data center – it may be advisable that customers or partners take additional steps to protect their systems.

This is principally to safeguard against situations where the IT admin or cloud provider cannot guarantee that all virtualized operating systems are protected. Deciding to take additional steps depends on the system software in use, the workload, and the customer’s assessment of the security threat model for their environment.

Depending on the additional steps taken, performance or resource utilization on select workloads may be affected and vary accordingly. The following charts show the observed performance of numerous PC client and Data center configurations. See the charts below for details.

There are three varieties of L1TF that have been identified that could potentially allow unauthorized disclosure of information residing in the L1 data cache, a small pool of memory within each processor core. The three varieties include:

·         **L1 Terminal Fault – SGX (aka “**[**Foreshadow**](http://foreshadowattack.eu/)**”)** - may allow unauthorized disclosure of information residing in the L1 data cache from an Intel® SGX Enclave

·         **L1 Terminal Fault – OS/ SMM** - may allow unauthorized disclosure of information residing in the L1 data cache from the Operating System (OS) or System Management Mode (SMM)

·         **L1 Terminal Fault – VMM** - may allow unauthorized disclosure of information residing in the L1 data cache from a virtualized guest in Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM)

####

#### Is my data at risk of L1TF?

L1TF is a highly sophisticated attack method, and today Intel is not aware of any reported real-world usage of the new security issues. The best thing for people to do is to keep their systems up to date.

The microcode updates released earlier this year, when coupled with corresponding updates to operating system and hypervisor software available today from our industry partners, provide the vast majority of the Data center and PC Client installed base with the protections they need. Once systems are updated, the risk to most consumers and enterprise users is expected to be low. This includes most of the data center installed base and the vast majority of PC clients.

####

#### L1TF seems to affect a small segment of the market, will Intel provide solutions to all customers?

While these additional actions might be applicable to a relatively small portion of the market, we think it’s important to provide solutions for all our customers now, with future improvements available over time.

####

#### Are there mitigations in place?

Yes. The microcode updates released earlier this year when coupled with operating system and hypervisor software updates available now from our industry partners, ensure consumers, IT professionals and cloud service providers have access to the protections they need.

For in-depth information, visit our Software Security website at [software.intel.com/side-channel.](https://software.intel.com/security-software-guidance/)

####

#### Is Intel aware of any real-world usage of these new security issues?

No. Today, Intel is not aware of any reported real-world usage of the new security issues.

####

#### Is this mitigated in future hardware?

Yes. L1TF vulnerabilities are addressed by the same changes in hardware that also mitigate GPZ Variant 3.

####

#### Are there tools to detect a bad actor attempting a L1TF exploit on my system?

Intel has developed a method to detect L1TF-based exploits during system operation, applying mitigation only when necessary. Intel has provided pre-release microcode with this capability to some of our partners for evaluation, and hope to expand this offering over time.

####

#### When did Intel learn about the issue?

L1TF-SGX was presented to Intel and other companies in January 2018. Further research by our security team identified two related varieties of L1TF with the potential to impact other microprocessors, operating systems and virtualization software. We and other companies worked together to develop and validate firmware, operating system and virtualization software updates for impacted technologies, and make them widely available as quickly as possible. Intel – and nearly the entire technology industry – follows a disclosure practice called Coordinated Disclosure, under which a cybersecurity vulnerability is generally publicly disclosed only after mitigations are deployed. ([See CERT Guide to Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetid=503330).) Intel is committed to coordinated disclosure as the industry standard.

####

#### Is Intel recommending that I disable HT?

No. The [Microcode updates](https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/addressing-new-research-for-side-channel-analysis/) (MCUs) we released earlier this year are an important component of the mitigation strategy for all three varieties of L1TF. When coupled with corresponding updates to operating system and hypervisor software released by our industry partners and the open source community starting today, these updates help ensure consumers, IT professionals, and cloud service providers have access to the protections they need.

For a portion of the market – specifically a subset of those running traditional virtualization technology, and primarily in the datacenter – it may be advisable that customers or partners take additional steps to protect their systems. These additional steps will depend on the system software in use, the workload, and the customer’s assessment of the security threat model for their environment. In many of those cases, Intel Hyper-Threading will NOT need to be turned off in order to provide full mitigation. Consult with your hypervisor vendor for more guidance.

####

#### What is “coordinated disclosure” and why is it important?

Coordinated disclosure (also referred to as “responsible disclosure”) is widely regarded as the best way to responsibly protect customers from security vulnerabilities. Coordinated disclosure is based on two foundational concepts: (1) when companies become aware of security vulnerabilities, they work as quickly, collaboratively, and effectively as possible to mitigate those vulnerabilities, and (2) the companies simultaneously take steps to minimize the risk that exploitable information becomes available before mitigations are available – through leaks or otherwise – to those who would use it for malicious purposes.

These principles are perhaps best expressed by the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) at Carnegie Mellon’s Software Engineering Institute:

“The public and especially users of vulnerable products deserve to be informed about issues with those products and how the vendor handles those issues. At the same time, disclosing such information without review and mitigation only opens the public up to exploitation. The ideal scenario occurs when everyone coordinates and cooperates to protect the public.”

More information on coordinated disclosure and its importance can be found in the [Guide to Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/asset_files/SpecialReport/2017_003_001_503340.pdf).”

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed).

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

**Summary:**

Security researchers have identified a speculative execution side-channel method called L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF). This method impacts select microprocessor products supporting Intel® Software Guard Extensions (Intel® SGX). Further investigation by Intel has identified two related applications of L1TF with the potential to impact additional microprocessors, operating systems, system management mode, and virtualization software. If used for malicious purposes, this class of vulnerability has the potential to improperly infer data values from multiple types of computing devices.

Intel is committed to product and customer security and to coordinated disclosure. We worked closely with other technology companies, operating system, and hypervisor software vendors, developing an industry-wide approach to mitigate these issues promptly and constructively.

For facts about these new exploits, technical resources, and steps you can take to help protect systems and information please visit: <https://www.intel.com/securityfirst>.

## Intel processors are vulnerable to a speculative execution side-channel attack called L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF)

#### Vulnerability Note VU#982149

Original Release Date: 2018-08-15 | Last Revised: 2018-09-10

---

### Overview

Intel processors are vulnerable to one or more L1 data cache information disclosure and terminal fault attacks via a speculative execution side channel. These attacks are known as L1 Terminal Fault: SGX, L1 Terminal Fault: OS/SMM, and L1 Terminal Fault: VMM.

### Description

| Speculative execution is a technique used by many modern processors to improve performance by predicting which instructions may be executed based on past execution history. When a program attempts to access data in memory, the logical memory address is translated to a physical address by the hardware. Accessing a logical or linear address that is not mapped to a physical location on the hardware will result in a terminal fault. Once the fault is triggered, there is a gap before resolution where the processor will use speculative execution to try to load data. During this time, the processor could speculatively access the level 1 data cache, potentially allowing side-channel methods to infer information that would otherwise be protected. More information about L1 terminal fault can be found [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/l1tf.html).  [**CWE-208**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/208.html)**: Information Exposure Through Timing Discrepancy**CVE-2018-3615 - L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF) SGX - also known as Foreshadow or Foreshadow-SGXSystems with microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and Intel software guard extensions (Intel SGX) may allow unauthorized disclosure of information residing in the L1 data cache from an enclave to an attacker with local user access via side-channel analysis. An unprivileged attacker can execute transient instructions, and once the processor determines that it should not have speculatively executed them, the changes are discarded and a page fault is issued. After the OS catches the fault, the user-level exception handler is called and the user can measure the secret enclave byte and use this to find the secret index in the CPU cache. CVE-2018-3620 - L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF) OS/SMM - also known as Foreshadow-OSSystems with microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and address translations may allow unauthorized disclosure of information residing in the L1 data cache to an attacker with local user access via a terminal page fault and side-channel analysis. When the OS kernel decides to swap virtual memory, it may leave metadata in a page table after unmapping a virtual page that could point to a valid physical address that contains sensitive data. After the kernel clears this data, it produces a terminal fault while dereferencing the unmapped page. Even with the terminal fault, the L1 data cache still sends the unauthorized data on to the transient out-of-order execution in case the metadata present represents a cached physical address. The information that could be read by an attacker can include information from the operating system's kernel (OS) and the System Management Mode (SMM). CVE-2018-3646 - L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF) VMM - also known as Foreshadow-VMMSystems with microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and address translations may allow unauthorized disclosure of information residing in the L1 data cache to an attacker with local user access with guest OS privilege via a terminal page fault and a side-channel analysis. Since a guest VM has control over the first address mapping, they can trigger terminal faults that allow them to transiently read any cached physical memory on the system, including memory from other VMs. Unlike L1TF OS/SMM, an attacker exploiting the virtual machine can control physical addresses used to access the L1 cache during transient instructions and even point to guest physical memory. |

### Impact

| An attacker with the ability to execute arbitrary code, with or without root privileges, can infer the contents of operating system, application, or SMM memory (CVE-2018-3620), secure SGX enclave memory (CVE-2018-3615), or memory used by virtual machines on the same host as the attacker (CVE-2018-3646).Only some Intel processors are affected by these vulnerabilities. Please see [INTEL-SA-00161](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00161.html) for details. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply BIOS and OS updates**Only some Intel processors are impacted by CVE-2018-3615, as older ones are not SGX capable. Please see the full list of affected products [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00161.html).Mitigating all three vulnerabilities requires microcode updates provided by Intel and are typically delivered by OEM vendors through BIOS updates. The status of available microcode can be found [here](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/sa00115-microcode-update-guidance.pdf).Mitigating CVE-2018-3620 (OS/SMM) requires updates to operating system software.Mitigating CVE-2018-3646 (VMM) requires updates to operating system and virtualization software.**Disable Hyper-threading**CVE-2018-3646 (VMM) can also be mitigated by disabling hyper-threading. If microcode, BIOS, OS, and virtualization software has been updated on both hosts and guests, it is not necessary to disable hyper-threading.**Perform TCB Recovery**Out of concern that an attacker could have compromised secret SGX keys using CVE-2018-3615, consider re-keying trusted computing base and SGX applications. This can be achieved by updating the BIOS and receiving an update from the application’s support team. |

### Vendor Statement

INTEL-SA-00161

Security researchers have identified a speculative execution side-channel method called L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF). This method impacts select microprocessor products supporting Intel® Software Guard Extensions (Intel® SGX). Further investigation by Intel has identified two related applications of L1TF with the potential to impact additional microprocessors, operating systems, system management mode, and virtualization software. If used for malicious purposes, this class of vulnerability has the potential to improperly infer data values from multiple types of computing devices.
Intel is committed to product and customer security and to coordinated disclosure. We worked closely with other technology companies, operating system, and hypervisor software vendors, developing an industry-wide approach to mitigate these issues promptly and constructively.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• As a prerequisite for an attack, an attacker must be able to run untrusted code on affected systems.

Siemens recommends limiting the possibilities to run untrusted code if possible.

• Applying a Defense-in-Depth concept can help to reduce the probability that untrusted code is run
on the system. Siemens recommends to apply the Defense-in-Depth concept: https://www.siemens.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

### Intel® Product Security Announcements

Intel is focused on ensuring the security of our customers computing environments. We are committed to rapidly addressing issues as they arise, and providing recommendations through security advisories and security [announcements](/content/www/us/en/security-center/announcement/default.html).

### Report a Vulnerability

If you have information about a security issue or vulnerability with an **Intel branded product or technology**, please send an e-mail to secure@intel.com. Encrypt sensitive information using our [PGP public key](/content/www/us/en/security-center/pgp-public-key.html).

Please provide as much information as possible, including:

* The products and versions affected
* Detailed description of the vulnerability
* Information on known exploits

A member of the Intel Product Security Team will review your e-mail and contact you to collaborate on resolving the issue. For more information on how Intel works to resolve security issues, see:

* [Vulnerability handling guidelines](/content/www/us/en/security-center/vulnerability-handling-guidelines.html)

For issues related to Intel's external web presence (Intel.com and related subdomains), please contact Intel's External Security Research team.

### Intel® Bug Bounty Program

Intel Corporation believes that working with skilled security researchers across the globe is a crucial part of identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities in Intel products. Like other major technology companies, Intel incentivizes security researchers to report security vulnerabilities in Intel products to us to enable a coordinated response. To encourage closer collaboration with the security research community on these kinds of issues, Intel created its Bug Bounty Program. If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in an Intel product or technology, we encourage you to notify us through our program and work with us to mitigate and to coordinate disclosure of the vulnerability.

Watch this video, [So You Found a Vulnerability](/content/www/us/en/security-center/so-you-found-a-vulnerability.html), to find out what you can expect when participating in the Intel® Bug Bounty Program.

### Intel Security Vulnerability Researcher Community Code of Conduct

The [Code of Conduct](/content/www/us/en/security-center/Code_of_Conduct.html) applies to all interactions among persons reporting or discussing security issues with Intel employees (‘Community Members’). It outlines the expected/acceptable standards of behavior, classifies some unacceptable behaviors, and describes possible enforcement actions for the Community Member interactions if unacceptable behavior arises during crowdsourced security vulnerability research such as the Intel® Bug Bounty Program, Project Circuit Breaker, vulnerability reporting, or any other communications interactions such as slack channels, email communication, or in person communications.
