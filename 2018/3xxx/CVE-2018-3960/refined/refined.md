  "CVE-2018-3960": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in accessing saved references to certain properties of the `this.info` object after the document has been closed using the `closeDoc` method which frees the object in memory. Subsequent access of the freed object leads to a use-after-free condition.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use-after-free",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution",
    "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted PDF document, or visiting a malicious site if the browser plugin is enabled",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick the user to open the malicious PDF document. If the browser plugin extension is enabled, visiting a malicious site can also trigger the vulnerability."
