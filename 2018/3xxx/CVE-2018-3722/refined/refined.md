Based on the provided content, here's an analysis relating to CVE-2018-3722:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the `__proto__` property within the `merge-deep` JavaScript library. The code was not explicitly checking for and excluding `__proto__` when iterating through object keys during the merging process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The primary vulnerability is prototype pollution. By including `__proto__` as a key in the source object, an attacker could overwrite properties of the `Object.prototype`. This is possible because the code iterates through the keys of the source object and merges them into the target object without explicitly excluding the `__proto__` property.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Overwriting properties of the `Object.prototype` can lead to unexpected behavior in the application, potentially resulting in a DoS.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In specific scenarios where the overwritten properties are later accessed and used within a vulnerable application's logic, this could be leveraged to achieve RCE.
- **Data Tampering:**  An attacker might manipulate the behavior of code by modifying the prototype.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker provides a crafted JSON object to `mergeDeep` that contains a `__proto__` key with malicious values to be merged into other objects.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input object that is provided to the `mergeDeep` function. This requires having the ability to provide data to be merged, often through API calls or manipulation of configuration files.

**Additional Details:**
The provided content shows a commit that addresses this issue by adding a check to prevent the `__proto__` property from being merged.
```javascript
if (key === '__proto__' || !hasOwn(obj, key)) {
  continue;
}
```
This commit explicitly prevents the `__proto__` key from being processed, thus mitigating the prototype pollution vulnerability.
