Based on the provided content, here's an analysis in relation to CVE-2018-3720:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The commit `19953a8c089b0328c470acaaaf6accdfcb34da11` in the `assign-deep` repository addresses a vulnerability related to the handling of the `__proto__` property during deep object assignment. The original code iterated over all keys in the source object and assigned them to the target object. This includes the `__proto__` property, which can be used to modify the prototype of the target object, leading to potential prototype pollution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `assign-deep` function, prior to the fix, did not prevent the `__proto__` property from being copied, which can lead to modification of the Object prototype.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potential):** By modifying the prototype of objects, an attacker could potentially inject malicious properties or methods that are then inherited by all objects. This could lead to arbitrary code execution or other malicious behavior.
- **Denial of Service:** Prototype pollution can be used to create unexpected or problematic behavior that can disrupt or crash an application, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Manipulated Input:** An attacker could provide a maliciously crafted object containing a `__proto__` property as a source object to the `assign-deep` function.
- **Indirect Injection:** If an application using `assign-deep` takes user input, even indirectly, which can be used as source data for the function, this can also create an attack vector.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to control or influence the source object that's passed to the vulnerable `assign-deep` function.

**Summary of Fix:**
The commit `19953a8c089b0328c470acaaaf6accdfcb34da11` addresses the prototype pollution issue by adding a check:
```javascript
if (key !== '__proto__' && hasOwn(obj, key)) {
```
This change specifically excludes the `__proto__` property from being copied during deep object assignment, preventing the prototype pollution vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The commit message `exclude __proto__` is concise but clearly indicates the intention of the fix.
- The diff shows that one line was added (`if (key !== '__proto__' && hasOwn(obj, key))`) and one line was deleted (`if (hasOwn(obj, key))`). This shows that the core fix is a check to exclude the `__proto__` property.
