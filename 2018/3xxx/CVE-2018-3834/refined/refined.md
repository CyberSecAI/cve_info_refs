- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Insteon Hub firmware upgrade process fetches firmware images via plain HTTP and doesn't validate if the firmware image matches the target MCU before flashing. The device trusts signed firmware without checking if it's the correct type ("FW" or "PLM").
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Lack of firmware type validation during upgrade: The device does not verify if the downloaded firmware is intended for the specific MCU it is about to flash.
    - Usage of plain HTTP for firmware downloads: The device downloads firmware using unencrypted HTTP, allowing for a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack.
    - Improper access control (CWE-284): The device doesn't properly control access to the firmware flashing process, allowing an attacker to substitute firmware intended for different components.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful attack results in a permanent denial of service (bricking) of the Insteon Hub device. Flashing an incorrect firmware erases the main MCU's flash memory, rendering the device unusable.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack: An attacker intercepts the HTTP request for firmware and substitutes a malicious firmware image.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept and modify network traffic between the Insteon Hub and the remote server "cache.insteon.com".
    - The attacker needs to be able to serve a signed firmware image, even if it is not for the correct MCU.
