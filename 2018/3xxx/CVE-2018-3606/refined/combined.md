# Advisory Details

## Trend Micro Control Manager ComponentCompliance SQL Injection Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-18-105ZDI-CAN-5128

| CVE ID | [CVE-2018-3606](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-3606) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 6.0, [AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Trend Micro](http://www.trendmicro.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | Control Manager |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['29806']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Trend Micro Control Manager. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.  The specific flaw exists within the ComponentCompliance method, which is called by the reporting servlet. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to construct SQL queries. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the Network Service account. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Trend Micro has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |
