# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2018-0586

## Computerinsel Photoline ANI Parsing Code Execution Vulnerability

##### July 11, 2018

##### CVE Number

CVE-2018-3922

### Summary

A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the ANI-parsing functionality of Computerinsel Photoline 20.54. A specially crafted ANI image processed via the application can lead to a stack overflow, overwriting arbitrary data. An attacker can deliver an ANI image to trigger this vulnerability and gain code execution.

### Tested Versions

Computerinsel Photoline 20.54 for OS X

### Product URLs

<https://www.pl32.com/>

### CVSSv3 Score

8.8 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow

### Details

Photoline is an image processing tool used to modify and edit images, as well as other graphics-editing tasks. This product has a large user base, and is popular in the graphic design field. The vulnerability arises in parsing the ANI image, specifically dealing with the size value in the header. Below is a small dump of the included proof of concept.

```
52 49 46 46 D6 E3 01 00 41 43 4F 4E 4C 49 53 54 4E 00 00 00 49 4E 46 4F 49 4E 41 4D FF 00 60 00  [0]

```

At [0], the last four bytes are interpreted as a length value for the image data. By supplying an overly large value, in this case 0x600000FF, the program will read beyond the bounds of the supplied buffer. The code causing the crash is shown below.

```
  if ( v19 == 'INAM' )                                    [1]
  {
    v12 = 1;
    if ( !v10 )
      v12 = memcpy_wrapper(source, &dest, length) != 0;    [2]

```

The code at [1] is doing a comparison on a header value, then subsequently calling in to memcpy. The length value passed in [2] is taken from the header shown above. This allows an attacker to supply an arbitrary length and overflow as much as desired. This creates an out-of-bounds write that could be exploited to gain code execution.
