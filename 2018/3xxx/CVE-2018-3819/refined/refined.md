- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An incomplete fix for a previous security issue (ESA-2017-23) in Kibana's login page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Open redirect vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can craft a malicious link that redirects users to an arbitrary website, potentially leading to phishing attacks or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious URL that uses the vulnerable Kibana login page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to craft URLs and entice users to click them. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the open redirect, it can be triggered on the login page.
