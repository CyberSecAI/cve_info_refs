      "ID": "CVE-2018-3942",
      "description": "An exploitable use-after-free vulnerability exists in the JavaScript engine of Foxit Softwareâ€™s PDF Reader, version 9.1.0.5096. A specially crafted PDF document can trigger a previously freed object in memory to be reused, resulting in arbitrary code execution. An attacker needs to trick the user to open the malicious file to trigger this vulnerability. If the browser plugin extension is enabled, visiting a malicious site can also trigger the vulnerability.",
      "vulnerability_details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from closing a PDF document while JavaScript code is still executing. This action frees objects used by the JavaScript engine, but the JavaScript execution may continue, referencing objects that have already been freed.",

          "Use-after-free condition."
