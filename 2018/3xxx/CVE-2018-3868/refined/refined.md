- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from parsing a PSD document where the application uses unchecked data from the document to calculate an address. Specifically, a crafted blending channel value leads to a miscalculation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write vulnerability (CWE-787) due to a crafted blending channel value in a PSD file causing a loop to write beyond the allocated buffer. The decrement variable is converted to an unsigned int which allows for an overflow causing out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can deliver a crafted PSD document which, when processed by the application, can lead to an out-of-bounds write allowing for arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a specially crafted PSD document.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to deliver a malicious PSD file to a user of the vulnerable software and have that user open the file with the vulnerable application.
