Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-3993:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**
   - The provided text explicitly mentions "CVE-2018-3993" and describes a "Foxit PDF Reader Javascript Optional Content Group Remote Code Execution Vulnerability" which matches the title given in the CVE. Thus, this information is relevant to the CVE.

**2. Root Cause of the Vulnerability**
   - The root cause is a use-after-free vulnerability within Foxit PDF Reader's JavaScript engine. This occurs when a JavaScript attempts to access an Optional Content Group (OCG) object after the document it belongs to has been closed, leading to a reference to a freed object.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**
    - Use-After-Free: The core vulnerability is a use-after-free condition, where a memory region is accessed after it has been released.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**
   - **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows arbitrary code execution, enabling the attacker to perform malicious actions on the victim's system.
   - **Crash:** The vulnerability also causes the application to crash if exploited unsuccessfully.

**5. Attack Vectors**
   - **Malicious PDF Document:** An attacker can craft a malicious PDF document containing the exploit. The user needs to be tricked into opening this file.
   - **Browser Plugin Extension:** If the Foxit PDF Reader browser plugin is enabled, a malicious website can trigger this vulnerability if the user visits it.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**
   - **Social Engineering:** The attacker must convince the user to open the malicious PDF document.
    -   **Knowledge of Exploit:** The attacker requires knowledge of how to exploit the use-after-free vulnerability.
    -   **Malicious Infrastructure:** If exploiting through the browser plugin, the attacker needs a malicious website.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when JavaScript code attempts to access an Optional Content Group (OCG) object after the document containing that OCG has been closed.
*   A reference to the OCG object persists in the JavaScript, even after the document's closure which frees the memory.
*   Accessing the freed memory results in the use-after-free condition.
*  The vulnerability can be triggered by using the following javascript:
```
var tmp = this.getOCGs()[0];  // save reference to first OCG
app.activeDocs[0].closeDoc(); // close and free objects
tmp["state"] = 0; // access stale reference causes use-after-free

```
*   Heap spraying can be used to manipulate the memory layout to gain more reliable control of the program's execution flow.
