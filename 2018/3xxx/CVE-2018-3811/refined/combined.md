# 2. Technical Details & Description:

Authentication Bypass vulnerability in the Smart Google Code Inserter plugin 3.4 allows unauthenticated attackers to insert arbitrary javascript or HTML code which runs on all pages served by Wordpress. The saveGoogleCode() function in smartgooglecode.php does not check if the current request is made by an authorized user, thus allowing any unauthenticated user to successfully update the inserted code.

SQL Injection vulnerability, when coupled with the Authentication Bypass vulnerability in the Smart Google Code Inserter plugin 3.4 allows unauthenticated attackers to execute SQL queries in the context of the webserver. The saveGoogleAdWords() function in smartgooglecode.php did not use prepared statements and did not sanitize the $\_POST["oId"] variable before passing it as input into the SQL query.

I ran into an issue with the plugin when I upgraded. I emailed them from their website and within minutes they replied with a solution to my issue.
Also, plugin works great for us as we need lots of different adwords conversion codes.

We use this plugin to manage our meta verification for Bing and Google’s Webmaster Tools. We also have AdWords campaigns we use for a few of our programs, and need separate conversion codes for each campaign. This plugin allows us to do just that, which isn’t something I was able to get from any of the other plugins we tried.

CVE : CVE-2018-3810 (Authentication Bypass with resultant XSS)
CVE : CVE-2018-3811 (SQL Injection)

1. Product & Service Introduction:
==================================
Smart Google Code Inserter is a Wordpress plugin that makes it easy to add
Google Analytics tracking code as well as meta tag verification of
Webmaster Tools. As of now, the plugin has been downloaded 34,207 times and
has 9,000+ active installs.

2. Technical Details & Description:
===================================
Authentication Bypass vulnerability in the Smart Google Code Inserter

or HTML code which runs on all pages served by Wordpress. The
saveGoogleCode() function in smartgooglecode.php does not check if the

SQL Injection vulnerability, when coupled with the Authentication Bypass
vulnerability in the Smart Google Code Inserter plugin 3.4 allows

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
