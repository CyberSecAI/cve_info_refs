Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2018-3811:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `saveGoogleAdWords()` function within the `smartgooglecode.php` file of the Smart Google Code Inserter WordPress plugin does not properly sanitize the `$_POST["oId"]` variable before using it in an SQL query. Additionally, the function doesn't use prepared statements, which exacerbates the issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The lack of sanitization and prepared statements allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code via the `$_POST["oId"]` parameter, leading to arbitrary SQL query execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL query execution:** An unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries within the context of the webserver. This could lead to data breaches, modification of data, or complete database compromise.
- Combined with the authentication bypass (CVE-2018-3810), the SQLi vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to gain access to sensitive information, modify database records, or potentially take over the WordPress website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed via a crafted HTTP POST request to the `wp-admin/options-general.php?page=smartcode` endpoint.
- **`$_POST["oId"]` Parameter:** The malicious SQL code is injected through the `oId` parameter of the POST data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be logged in to the WordPress admin panel. They can exploit the vulnerability directly without prior authentication.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send the malicious HTTP POST request to the vulnerable server.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is present in version 3.4 of the Smart Google Code Inserter plugin.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to exploit this vulnerability using a `curl` command.
- The vendor was contacted, and a fix was implemented in version 3.5 of the plugin.
