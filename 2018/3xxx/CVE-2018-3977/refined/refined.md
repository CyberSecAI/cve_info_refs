{
  "CVE-2018-3977": {
    "Root cause": "Heap buffer overflow in the XCF image rendering functionality.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The library does not properly validate the number of tiles within an XCF layer against the destination surface size.",
      "The library uses an array of tile file offsets which is controlled by the attacker"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution or denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "By enticing a user to open a specially crafted XCF image file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious XCF file to the victim."
