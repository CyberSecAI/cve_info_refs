- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the IOCTL handler for the 0x222000 control code in the `hmpalert.sys` driver. Specifically, the `sub_975CAED0` function does not properly initialize a buffer before returning it to user mode. The function sets specific bytes at offsets 0, 1, 8 and 12 but not the bytes between offset 2 and 7 which are then returned to the user mode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Kernel memory disclosure due to uninitialized buffer being returned to user mode.
    - Lack of input validation, specifically the size of `SystemBuffer` is not checked before being passed to `sub_975CAED0`.
    - The device driver allows any user on the system to send IOCTL requests due to insecure access control.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Disclosure of kernel memory, potentially exposing sensitive information. The leaked information can potentially be leveraged for further attacks or gaining system-level access.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Sending a specially crafted IRP (I/O Request Packet) with the IOCTL code 0x222000 to the `\Device\hmpalert` device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Attacker needs to be a user on the local system, due to insecure access controls on the device file.
    - Ability to send IOCTL requests to the device driver.
