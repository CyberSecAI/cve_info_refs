|  |  | ## Exceptions |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | If you do not receive an acknowledgement within the said time frame please give |
|  |  | us the benefit of the doubt as it's possible that we haven't seen it yet. In |
|  |  | this case please send us a message \*\*without details\*\* using one of the |
|  |  | following methods: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - Give a poke on Twitter [@3rdEden](https://twitter.com/3rdEden) |
|  |  | - Contact the lead developers of this project on their personal e-mails. You |
|  |  | can find the e-mails in the git logs, for example using the following command: |
|  |  | `git --no-pager show -s --format='%an <%ae>' <gitsha>` where `<gitsha>` is the |
|  |  | SHA1 of their latest commit in the project. |
|  |  |  |
