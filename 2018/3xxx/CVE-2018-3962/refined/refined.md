Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2018-3962:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly mentions CVE-2018-3962 within the "Vulnerability details" section of the Talos Intelligence report, thus it's a relevant source.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of CVE-2018-3962 lies in a use-after-free vulnerability present in Foxit PDF Reader's JavaScript engine. When a PDF document with embedded JavaScript is closed using `closeDoc`, specific properties of `this.info` object, specifically `CreationDate`, can still be referenced, which leads to a use-after-free condition.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Free (UAF):**  The core vulnerability is a use-after-free condition. This arises when the application tries to access memory that has already been freed, resulting in corruption and potential arbitrary code execution.
*   **JavaScript Engine Vulnerability:** The JavaScript engine fails to properly handle object references after document closure.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** By controlling the freed memory, an attacker could control the execution flow of the application and potentially execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
*   **Application Crash:** The UAF condition leads to an application crash.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PDF Document:**  An attacker can embed malicious JavaScript within a PDF document to trigger the use-after-free condition.
*   **Malicious Website (with Plugin Enabled):** If the browser plugin extension is enabled for Foxit PDF Reader, visiting a website containing malicious code can also trigger this vulnerability.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Attacker Needs to Trick the User:** The attacker needs to entice the user into opening a specifically crafted malicious PDF document to trigger this vulnerability.
*  **Browser Plugin:** If a malicious website is used as the attack vector, the Foxit PDF Reader's browser plugin needs to be enabled.

**Technical Details:**

The provided content details the vulnerability using the following example javascript code which illustrates the vulnerability:
```javascript
function main() {
var tmp = this.info;
app.activeDocs[0].closeDoc();
tmp['CreationDate'].toString();
}
main();
```

This code snippet when executed within a vulnerable version of Foxit PDF Reader causes a crash with the following access violation information:

```
(aa0.1350): Access violation - code c0000005 (first chance)
First chance exceptions are reported before any exception handling.
This exception may be expected and handled.

FoxitReader!CryptVerifyMessageSignature+0x695c6:
01a50e76 8b01            mov     eax,dword ptr [ecx]  ds:0023:0e492da8=????????
```

The crash occurs when the code tries to dereference a pointer `ecx` that contains a freed memory address. This highlights the root cause of the vulnerability:  `tmp['CreationDate'].toString()` attempts to access a now invalid memory location after the document is closed, which leads to an access violation. This use-after-free condition allows an attacker to potentially overwrite the memory and execute arbitrary code by controlling the contents of the `edx` register which is used in a call instruction.
