Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-3887

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the PCX image parsing functionality of Computerinsel Photoline 20.53, specifically within the run-length encoding decompression. The program incorrectly calculates the size of the compressed data.
*   **Weaknesses:** The code lacks proper bounds checking after incrementing the `image_buffer` pointer during decompression. This allows writing beyond the allocated buffer.
*   **Vulnerability:** An out-of-bounds write occurs due to missing validation, enabling the overwriting of arbitrary data. Specifically, the code reads a byte from the compressed data stream. If the byte's value is less than `0xC0`, the byte is written to the image buffer, incrementing the buffer pointer. There is no check if the pointer goes beyond the allocated buffer. This allows an attacker to control the written data and location and can be leveraged to gain code execution.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution, as attackers can control the out-of-bounds write and overwrite crucial data/code.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can deliver a specially crafted PCX image to the application. When the application parses this image, the vulnerability is triggered.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted PCX file to be opened by the vulnerable application (Photoline 20.53)

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Software:** Computerinsel Photoline 20.53 for OS X
*   **CWE:** CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write
*   **CVSS Score:** 8.8 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
*   **Exploitability:**  The provided crash log shows the crash happening at the instruction `movb  %al,(%r9)` during a write operation (access_type=write), suggesting the vulnerability is exploitable.
