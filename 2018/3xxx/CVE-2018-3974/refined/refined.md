- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The GOG Galaxy installation directory and its files, including the `GalaxyClientService.exe`, have insecure default file permissions, granting "Full Control" to the "Everyone" group.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Incorrect default file system permissions (CWE-276).
    - The service executable `GalaxyClientService.exe` runs with `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` privileges, making it a high-value target.
    - The GOG Galaxy client launches automatically on login via a registry key, triggering the execution of the vulnerable service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can achieve local privilege escalation by overwriting the `GalaxyClientService.exe` with a malicious executable. The next time the service starts (which is upon login), the malicious code will execute with `SYSTEM` privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Local attacker, can be any user on the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to write files to the GOG Galaxy installation directory, which is granted by the default insecure permissions.
