# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2018-0640

## GOG Galaxy service insecure file permissions local privilege elevation vulnerability

##### March 26, 2019

##### CVE Number

CVE-2018-3974

### Summary

An exploitable local privilege elevation vulnerability exists in the file system permissions of GOG Galaxy’s install directory. An attacker can overwrite an executable that is launched as a system service on boot by default to exploit this vulnerability and execute arbitrary code with system privileges.

### Tested Versions

Gog Galaxy 1.2.45.61 (Windows 64-bit Installer)

### Product URLs

<https://www.gog.com/galaxy>

### CVSSv3 Score

9.3 - CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions

### Details

GOG Galaxy is a platform that allows users to launch, update and manage video games. By default, GOG Galaxy is installed in a directory that allows anyone on the system to have “full control.” This allows all users to read, write or modify arbitrary files in the install directory.

```
C:>icacls “C:\Program Files (x86)\GOG Galaxy”
C:\Program Files (x86)\GOG Galaxy Everyone:(F)
Everyone:(OI)(CI)(IO)(F)
Everyone:(OI)(CI)(IO)(M,WDAC,WO,GA,DC)
NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller:(I)(F)
NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller:(I)(CI)(IO)(F)
NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(F)
NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(OI)(CI)(IO)(F)
BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(F)
BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(OI)(CI)(IO)(F)
BUILTIN\Users:(I)(RX)

CREATOR OWNER:(I)(OI)(CI)(IO)(F)
APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES:(I)(RX)
APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES:(I)(OI)(CI)(IO)(GR,GE)
APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL RESTRICTED APPLICATION PACKAGES:(I)(RX)
APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL RESTRICTED APPLICATION PACKAGES:(I)(OI)(CI)(IO)(GR,GE)

GalaxyClientService.exe is installed as a local service that is run with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM privileges and allows users to replace or modify the executable.

```
C:\>icacls "C:\Program Files (x86)\GOG Galaxy\GalaxyClientService.exe"
C:\Program Files (x86)\GOG Galaxy\GalaxyClientService.exe Everyone:(I)(F)
                                                          NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(F)
                                                          BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(F)
                                                          BUILTIN\Users:(I)(RX)
                                                          ORBIT\rjohnson:(I)(F)
                                                          APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES:(I)(RX)
                                                          APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL RESTRICTED APPLICATION PACKAGES:(I)(RX)

```

This command shows that the service runs with LocalSystem permissions.

```
C:\>sc qc GalaxyClientService
[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS

SERVICE_NAME: GalaxyClientService
        TYPE               : 10  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS
        START_TYPE         : 3   DEMAND_START
        ERROR_CONTROL      : 1   NORMAL
        BINARY_PATH_NAME   : "C:\Program Files (x86)\GOG Galaxy\GalaxyClientService.exe"
        LOAD_ORDER_GROUP   :
        TAG                : 0
        DISPLAY_NAME       : GalaxyClientService
        DEPENDENCIES       :
        SERVICE_START_NAME : LocalSystem

```

This shows that this service is set to start manually on demand. GOG Galaxy installs a registry key to launch the GalaxyClient.exe on login, which in turn triggers the privileged service to run.

```
C:\tools\sysinternals>autorunsc64.exe -a l -m
-- snip --
HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
   GalaxyClient
     C:\Program Files (x86)\GOG Galaxy\GalaxyClient.exe /launchViaAutoStart
     GOG Galaxy
     GOG.com
     1.2.45.61
     c:\program files (x86)\gog galaxy\galaxyclient.exe
     7/10/2018 3:39 AM
--snip--

```
### Mitigation

Users of GOG Galaxy can replace the `Full Control` permission with `Read and Execute` for the `Everyone` group on the GOG Galaxy install directory and ensure all file system objects below that path inherit from the parent directory.
