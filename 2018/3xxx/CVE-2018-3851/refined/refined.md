- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the way Hyland Perceptive Document Filters processes CDATA sections within Microsoft Word XML documents. Specifically, when a CDATA section is empty, the code incorrectly calculates the size of the text content, resulting in a negative value being passed to `memcpy`. This leads to an out-of-bounds write.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap corruption due to an out-of-bounds write during a `memcpy` operation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution is possible if the heap corruption is properly leveraged.
- **Attack vectors:**  A specially crafted Microsoft Word (XML) file needs to be processed by the vulnerable document filter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to provide a crafted malicious document. No special privileges are required on the user end.
