Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-3721:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the way the `lodash` library handles property merging, specifically when dealing with the `__proto__` property.
*   Older versions of `lodash` (prior to 4.17.5) did not properly sanitize or check for `__proto__` properties during merge operations, leading to potential prototype pollution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Prototype Pollution:** The core vulnerability is prototype pollution. By crafting a malicious object with a `__proto__` property, an attacker can inject or overwrite properties in the base `Object.prototype`, which affects all objects within the JavaScript environment.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Modification:** An attacker can modify existing object properties by polluting the prototype.
*   **Potential for DoS:** Although not directly mentioned in the provided text, prototype pollution can sometimes lead to denial-of-service by injecting properties or methods that cause errors or unexpected behaviors.
*   **Privilege escalation**: It's possible that an attacker could leverage prototype pollution to gain elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited through the `_.merge` or `_.mergeWith` functions of the Lodash library. By providing a specially crafted object to these functions, an attacker could cause the properties to be merged into the prototype.
*   Specifically, the attacker would provide a JSON object containing a `__proto__` key with malicious values.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to control input:** The attacker needs to be able to influence or control the data that is passed to the vulnerable `lodash` functions. This would typically require an attacker to control either data that's being merged into the object or some data stored by the application and later merged with other objects.
*   **Low privileges:** The CVSS score indicates that the attacker needs low level privileges to execute this vulnerability.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

*   The provided GitHub commit ([d8e069c](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/commit/d8e069cc3410082e44eb18fcf8e7f3d08ebe1d4a)) addresses this issue by implementing the `safeGet` function, which avoids retrieving properties from the `__proto__` object. This is done in the `baseMergeDeep` function, which is used by `_.merge` and `_.mergeWith`.
*   The NetApp advisory ([NTAP-20190919-0004](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190919-0004)) lists several NetApp products that were affected by this vulnerability due to their use of vulnerable `lodash` versions.
*   The fix involves upgrading `lodash` to version 4.17.5 or later which contains the fix included in commit `d8e069c`.

In summary, CVE-2018-3721 is a prototype pollution vulnerability in `lodash` that allows attackers to manipulate object prototypes by controlling input to specific lodash functions and can result in data modification and potential denial-of-service, requiring a low level of privilege.
