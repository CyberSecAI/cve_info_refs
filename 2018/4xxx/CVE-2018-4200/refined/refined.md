Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2018-4200:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a memory corruption issue. Specifically, it's a use-after-free vulnerability in `WebCore::jsElementScrollHeightGetter`
*   **Weakness:** The core weakness lies in improper state management within the WebKit component.
*  **Impact:** The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is the potential for arbitrary code execution. Additionally, it can cause denial of service by causing the application to crash.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector involves processing maliciously crafted web content. This could be through a website or any application that uses WebKit to render web content.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to create or control a web page or piece of content with malicious code that can trigger the vulnerability within the WebKit engine. They need to trick the victim into accessing this content.

**Affected Products/Systems:**

*   **Safari 11.1:** Affected on macOS El Capitan, macOS Sierra, and macOS High Sierra.
*   **iTunes 12.7.5 for Windows:** Affected on Windows 7 and later.
*  **iCloud for Windows 7.5:** Affected on Windows 7 and later.
*   **iOS 11.3.1:** Affected on iPhone 5s and later, iPad Air and later, and iPod touch 6th generation.
*   **tvOS 11.4:** Affected on Apple TV 4K and Apple TV (4th generation).
*   **WebKitGTK+:** Affected versions prior to 2.20.4 in Ubuntu.

**Technical Details from Exploit-DB:**

*   The exploit-db entry provides a Proof of Concept (PoC) HTML code demonstrating the use-after-free in `WebCore::jsElementScrollHeightGetter` which triggers the vulnerability when the `scrollHeight` property of an input element is accessed after its render object has been destroyed
*   The PoC uses CSS to scale the keygen element, and Javascript to trigger the vulnerability when the `scrollHeight` of an input element is called.
*   The provided ASan log from the Exploit-DB entry shows the heap-use-after-free occurring when a freed StyleRareInheritedData object is accessed.

**Patches/Mitigations:**

*   Apple addressed the vulnerability by improving state management within WebKit in Safari, iTunes, iCloud, iOS, and tvOS.
*   Ubuntu addressed the vulnerability by updating WebKitGTK+ to version 2.20.4, which included the fix.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is reported to have been found by Ivan Fratric of Google Project Zero.
*   The Exploit-DB entry labels the type as "dos", but the descriptions across the different sources indicate that it can also lead to arbitrary code execution.
