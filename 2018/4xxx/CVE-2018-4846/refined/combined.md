PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The RAPIDLab 1200 system is a cartridge-based blood gas, electrolyte, and metabolite analyzer designed
for use in medium- to high-volume clinical laboratories.

The RAPIDPoint 400/405/500 systems are cartridge-based analyzers for blood-gas, electrolytes, and
metabolites designed for use in point-of-care environments.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.0
(CVSS v3.0) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.
