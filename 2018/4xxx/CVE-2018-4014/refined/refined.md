The content is related to CVE-2018-4014.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the handling of Wi-Fi command 9999 within the Roav A1 Dashcam firmware. The vulnerability occurs when processing a user-supplied string within the `str` parameter of the command. The string is copied using `sprintf` into a fixed-size stack buffer without proper bounds checking.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is a stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121) due to the use of `sprintf` with an unbounded user-controlled string as input, leading to memory corruption. The encoding function itself operates in-place on this buffer, further complicating exploitation since the buffer's contents must remain valid to avoid a crash prior to return.

- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution on the device by overwriting the return address on the stack.

- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the dashcam, specifically targeting the `custom=1&cmd=9999` command, including a long string in the `str` parameter. The dashcam must be in "Wi-Fi AP" mode for the attack to be successful, and the attacker must be connected to the dashcam's Wi-Fi network.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be within the Wi-Fi range of the dashcam and be connected to its Wi-Fi network.
    - The attacker needs to know that the dashcam is using the vulnerable firmware.
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the dashcam's web server on port 80 without authentication.
    - The attacker needs to know the format of the custom command string and be able to craft a long enough string to overflow the stack buffer.
