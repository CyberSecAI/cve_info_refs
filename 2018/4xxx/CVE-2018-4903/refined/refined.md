Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing TIFF Software tags within XPS files. This inadequate validation can lead to a read operation beyond the bounds of an allocated memory object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The core weakness is that the software reads memory outside of the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to disclose sensitive information from the application's memory.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Although the advisory specifies that this specific vulnerability results in information disclosure, it also mentions that an attacker could leverage it in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the current process. The Adobe bulletin also lists this vulnerability as being exploitable to achieve remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious File:** The target user must open a malicious XPS file containing a specially crafted TIFF Software tag.
*   **Malicious Web Page:** The target user must visit a malicious web page that triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by delivering a malicious file or directing the victim to a malicious page.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction, specifically the user needs to open the malicious file or visit a malicious page.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability affects Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.
* The vulnerability was reported to Adobe by Ke Liu of Tencent's Xuanwu LAB, along with willJ of Tencent PC Manager via Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.
* Adobe has released updates to address this vulnerability.
