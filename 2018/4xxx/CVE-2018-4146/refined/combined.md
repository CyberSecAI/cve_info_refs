# USN-3635-1: WebKitGTK+ vulnerabilities

30 April 2018

Several security issues were fixed in WebKitGTK+.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [webkit2gtk](/security/cves?package=webkit2gtk) - Web content engine library for GTK+

## Details

A large number of security issues were discovered in the WebKitGTK+ Web and

JavaScript engines. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious

website, a remote attacker could exploit a variety of issues related to web

browser security, including cross-site scripting attacks, denial of service

attacks, and arbitrary code execution.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 17.10

* [libjavascriptcoregtk-4.0-18](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit2gtk)
  -
  [2.20.1-0ubuntu0.17.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit2gtk/2.20.1-0ubuntu0.17.10.1)
* [libwebkit2gtk-4.0-37](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit2gtk)
  -
  [2.20.1-0ubuntu0.17.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit2gtk/2.20.1-0ubuntu0.17.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [libjavascriptcoregtk-4.0-18](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit2gtk)
  -
  [2.20.1-0ubuntu0.16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit2gtk/2.20.1-0ubuntu0.16.04.1)
* [libwebkit2gtk-4.0-37](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit2gtk)
  -
  [2.20.1-0ubuntu0.16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit2gtk/2.20.1-0ubuntu0.16.04.1)

This update uses a new upstream release, which includes additional bug

fixes. After a standard system update you need to restart any applications

that use WebKitGTK+, such as Epiphany, to make all the necessary changes.
