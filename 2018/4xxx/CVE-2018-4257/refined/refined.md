- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `AppleGraphicsPowerManagement` component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow due to insufficient size validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An application can execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious application running on the system can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to run a malicious application on the target macOS system.
