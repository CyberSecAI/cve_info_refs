These updates resolve an [important](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/severity-ratings.html) insecure library loading vulnerability (CVE-2018-4938), an [important](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/severity-ratings.html) cross-site scripting vulnerability that could lead to code injection (CVE-2018-4940) and an [important](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/severity-ratings.html) cross-site scripting vulnerability that could lead to information disclosure (CVE-2018-4941). These updates also include a mitigation for a [critical](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/severity-ratings.html) unsafe Java deserialization vulnerability (CVE-2018-4939) and a mitigation for a [critical](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/severity-ratings.html) unsafe XML parsing vulnerability (CVE-2018-4942).

### Affected Versions

| **Product** | **Affected Versions** | **Platform** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ColdFusion (2016 release) | Update 5 and earlier versions | All |
| ColdFusion 11 | Update 13 and earlier versions | All |

### Solution

Adobe categorizes this update with the following [priority rating](/security/severity-ratings.html) and recommends users update their installations to the newest versions:

| **Product** | **Updated Version** | **Platform** | **Priority rating** | **Availability** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### ColdFusion JDK Requirement

**COLDFUSION 2016 HF6**

This security update requires ColdFusion to be on JDK 8u121 or higher. Adobe recommends updating your ColdFusion JDK/JRE to the latest version. Applying the ColdFusion update without a corresponding JDK update will NOT secure the server.

**For Application Servers**

Additionally, on JEE installations, set the following JVM flag, "-Djdk.serialFilter= !org.mozilla.\*\*;!com.sun.syndication.\*\*", in the respective startup file depending on the type of Application Server being used.

For example:

On Apache Tomcat Application Server, edit JAVA\_OPTS in the ‘Catalina.bat/sh’ file

On WebLogic Application Server, edit JAVA\_OPTIONS in the ‘startWeblogic.cmd’ file

On a WildFly/EAP Application Server, edit JAVA\_OPTS in the ‘standalone.conf’ file

Set the JVM flags on a JEE installation of ColdFusion, not on a standalone installation.

**COLDFUSION 11 HF14**

This security update requires ColdFusion to be on JDK 7u131 or JDK 8u121 or higher.

Adobe recommends updating your ColdFusion JDK/JRE to the latest version. Applying the ColdFusion update without a corresponding JDK update will NOT secure the server.

**For Application Servers**

Additionally, on J2EE installations, set the following JVM flag, "-Djdk.serialFilter= !org.mozilla.\*\*;!com.sun.syndication.\*\*", in the respective startup file depending on the type of Application Server being used.

For example:

On Apache Tomcat Application Server, edit JAVA\_OPTS in the ‘Catalina.bat/sh’ file

On WebLogic Application Server, edit JAVA\_OPTIONS in the ‘startWeblogic.cmd’ file

On a WildFly/EAP Application Server, edit JAVA\_OPTS in the ‘standalone.conf’ file

Set the JVM flags on a JEE installation of ColdFusion, not on a standalone installation.

Priority and Severity rating systems for Security Bulletins

The Adobe Priority Rating System is a guideline to help our customers in managed environments prioritize Adobe security updates. We base our priority rankings on historical attack patterns for the relevant product, the type of vulnerability, the platform(s) affected, and any potential mitigations that are in place.

The definitions of the priority ratings are:

| **Rating** | **Definition** |
| --- | --- |
| **Priority 1** | This update resolves vulnerabilities being targeted, or which have a higher risk of being targeted, by exploit(s) in the wild for a given product version and platform. Adobe recommends administrators install the update as soon as possible. (for example, within 72 hours). |
| **Priority 2** | This update resolves vulnerabilities in a product that has historically been at elevated risk. There are currently no known exploits. Based on previous experience, we do not anticipate exploits are imminent. As a best practice, Adobe recommends administrators install the update soon (for example, within 30 days). |
| **Priority 3** | This update resolves vulnerabilities in a product that has historically not been a target for attackers. Adobe recommends administrators install the update at their discretion. |

The Adobe Severity Rating System is a guideline to help our customers assess the security impact of known software vulnerabilities.

The definitions of the severity ratings are:

| **Rating** | **Definition** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical** | A vulnerability, which, if exploited would allow malicious native-code to execute, potentially without a user being aware. |
| **Important** | A vulnerability, which, if exploited would compromise data security, potentially allowing access to confidential data, or could compromise processing resources. |
| **Moderate** | A vulnerability that is limited to a significant degree by factors such as default configuration, auditing, or is difficult to exploit. |
