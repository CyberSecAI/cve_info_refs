- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in the `removeASL` functionality of the Clean My Mac X helper service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of validation on the calling application, allowing any user to access the privileged `removeASL` function. This function stops system daemons and removes log files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local, unprivileged user can exploit the vulnerability to delete protected system logs and stop root daemons, which constitutes a privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the machine is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access to the vulnerable machine. No special permissions or privileges beyond a normal user account are needed before exploitation.
