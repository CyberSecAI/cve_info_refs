Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-4065:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `ping_result.cgi` binary in Sierra Wireless AirLink ES450 devices does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before reflecting it back to the client in the HTTP response.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS flaw.  By injecting malicious JavaScript code into the `host` parameter of the `ping_result.cgi` request, an attacker can cause the injected script to execute in the victim's browser when the server reflects the unsanitized input in its response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser session.
*   **Potential for Malicious Actions:** This can lead to a variety of malicious actions, including:
    *   Making requests on behalf of the user (e.g., changing settings).
    *   Disclosing confidential information or tokens.
    *   Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
    *   Other attacks depending on the userâ€™s browser context within the web application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be triggered via a crafted GET request to `ping_result.cgi`, with the malicious JavaScript code included in the `host` parameter. Example:
    ```
    GET /admin/tools/ping_result.cgi?host=1.1.1.1%27%3Cscript%3Ealert(%27xss%27)%3C/script%3E
    ```
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability can also be exploited via a crafted POST request to `ping_result.cgi` with the malicious payload in the `host` parameter of the request body. Example:
    ```
    POST /admin/tools/ping_result.cgi HTTP/1.1
    ...
    host=192.168.13.31<script>alert('xss')</script>
    ```
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to entice a victim to visit a crafted URL or click a link that redirects to the vulnerable `ping_result.cgi` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Prior Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without the need for prior authentication to the ACEManager web interface.
*  **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious link to the victim.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was tested on Sierra Wireless AirLink ES450 FW 4.9.3, and it is likely that the AirLink GX450 is also affected.
*   The vulnerability is present in the ACEManager web server, which is responsible for the majority of device interactions.
*   The vendor has stated that the ACEManager web application is not accessible by default from the Cellular WAN.
