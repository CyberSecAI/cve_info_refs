- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An authentication mechanism in the SICLOCK TC devices can be bypassed if an attacker gains specific device knowledge.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authentication bypass
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially read and modify the device configuration.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access is required to exploit the vulnerability, and the attacker needs to obtain specific device knowledge.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires network access to the affected devices and must obtain certain knowledge that is specific to the device. Successful exploitation requires no user interaction.
