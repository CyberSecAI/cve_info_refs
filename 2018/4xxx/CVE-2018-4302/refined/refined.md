Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2018-4302:

**Vulnerability:** CVE-2018-4302

**Root Cause:** A null pointer dereference vulnerability exists within the `libxml2` library.

**Weakness:** The vulnerability arises due to a lack of proper validation when processing XML data. Specifically, a null pointer dereference occurs, which can lead to a crash or potentially other undefined behavior.

**Impact:** Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. If the attacker can control the XML being processed, they could craft malicious XML that triggers the null pointer dereference, potentially crashing the application or gaining arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vector:** This vulnerability is triggered by processing maliciously crafted XML files or data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs the ability to supply or have the vulnerable application process malicious XML. This can be achieved through various means, such as by getting the application to parse a malicious XML file from disk or over the network, or by injecting the malicious XML into the application via a web page or other input mechanism.

**Affected Products:**
*   macOS High Sierra 10.13
*   iOS 11
*   iCloud for Windows 7.0
*   iTunes 12.7 for Windows
