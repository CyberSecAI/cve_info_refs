- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in the `removeDiagnosticLogs` function of the CleanMyMac X helper tool, which runs as root.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The privileged helper tool does not validate the calling application, allowing any application to call the `removeDiagnosticLogs` function. This function executes the `/usr/bin/log` command with the `--all` argument, which deletes the main log data from the system.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker can escalate privileges by calling the vulnerable function and deleting system logs, which could hinder auditing and potentially other security mechanisms relying on those logs.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the system is required. Any application can trigger the vulnerable function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access and the ability to execute code on the target machine.
