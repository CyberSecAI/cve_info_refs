- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The default configuration of coTURN allows relaying external traffic to the loopback interface of the host.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unsafe default configuration allows loopback forwarding.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can bypass firewalls and access other private services running on the loopback interface of the server, leading to further attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker sets up a TURN relay with a loopback address as the peer on an affected server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the coTURN server (typically in the DMZ) and act as a TURN client.
