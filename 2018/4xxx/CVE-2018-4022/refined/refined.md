The provided content is a vulnerability report for CVE-2018-4022.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the way MKVToolNix MKVINFO handles the MKV (matroska) file format. This occurs due to a double-free condition.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free: The program attempts to access memory that has already been freed, leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.
- Double-free: The same memory location is freed multiple times which leads to heap corruption.
- Lack of validation: The parser does not properly validate the element before attempting to use it, even after deletion.
- Improper error handling: An exception handler doesn't prevent the double-free condition.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- Program crash: The vulnerability can cause the program to terminate unexpectedly.
- Heap corruption: The double-free can corrupt the heap, leading to instability and potential further exploits.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious MKV file: The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted MKV file as input to the `mkvinfo` tool.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious MKV file to the user and convince them to open it using the vulnerable `mkvinfo` tool. Local access is sufficient.
