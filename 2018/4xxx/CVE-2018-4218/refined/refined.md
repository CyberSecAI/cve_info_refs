{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a use-after-free condition that occurs when resuming a JavaScript generator in WebKit. The generator's internal state (@generatorState) is checked to prevent recursion. However, it is possible to create a non-generator object with the generator state set to 'completed'. By then setting the prototype of this object to a generator, a bypass of the recursion check happens, and the generator's scope is released, leading to use-after-free.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-After-Free (UAF)",
	   "Insufficient type checking",
       "Incorrect handling of object properties",
       "Bypassing recursion checks"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by tricking a user into visiting a malicious website with crafted Javascript.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage and lure a victim to view it."
