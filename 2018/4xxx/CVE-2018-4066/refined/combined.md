A specially crafted authenticated HTTP request can inject arbitrary commands, resulting in remote code execution.

[CVE-2018-4061](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-4061) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### 4.2.2    [USE OF HARD-CODED CREDENTIALS CWE-798](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html)

Activating SNMPD outside of the WebUI can cause the activation of the hard-coded credentials, resulting in the exposure of a privileged user. An attacker can activate SNMPD without any configuration changes to trigger this vulnerability.

[CVE-2018-4062](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-4062) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:H)).

#### 4.2.3    [UNRESTRICTED UPLOAD OF FILE WITH DANGEROUS TYPE CWE-434](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/434.html)

A specially crafted authenticated HTTP request can upload a file, resulting in an executable, routable code upload to the web server.

[CVE-2018-4063](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-4063) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### 4.2.4    [IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

A specially crafted HTTP ping request can cause reflected JavaScript to be executed and run on the user’s browser. An attacker can exploit this by convincing a user to click a link or embedded URL that redirects to the reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability.

[CVE-2018-4065](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-4065) has been assigned to this vulnerability.

* If ALEOS Application Framework (AAF) is enabled, ensure a strong password is set for the AAF User account.
* If Telnet or SSH is enabled, ensure a strong password is set for the console account.

When connecting directly to ACEmanager:

* Use only HTTPS.
* Utilize an up-to-date, modern web browser with built-in CSS and CSRF protection, such as Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.

For more information, see the [Sierra Wireless security advisory](https://source.sierrawireless.com/resources/airlink/software_reference_docs/technical-bulletin/sierra-wireless-technical-bulletin---swi-psa-2019-003/).

The following SNORT rules will detect exploitation attempts. Note that additional rules may be released at a future date and current rules are subject to change pending additional vulnerability information. For the most current rule information, please refer to a Firepower Management Center or Snort.org.

Snort Rules: 48600, 48635, 48614 - 48621, 48747

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet.](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01)
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practice](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices)s on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics) in the technical information paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:

* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.
* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf) for more information on avoiding email scams.
* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-014) for more information on social engineering attacks.​​

# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2018-0751

## Sierra Wireless AirLink ES450 ACEManager Cross-Site Request Forgery Vulnerability

##### April 25, 2019

##### CVE Number

CVE-2018-4066

### Summary

An exploitable cross-site request forgery vulnerability exists in the ACEManager functionality of Sierra Wireless AirLink ES450 FW 4.9.3. A specially crafted HTTP request can cause an authenticated user to perform privileged requests unknowingly, resulting in unauthenticated requests being requested through an authenticated user. An attacker can get an authenticated user to request authenticated pages on the attacker’s behalf to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

Sierra Wireless AirLink ES450 FW 4.9.3

### Product URLs

<https://www.sierrawireless.com/products-and-solutions/routers-gateways/es450/>

### CVSSv3 Score

6.4 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

### Details

Sierra Wireless is a wireless communications equipement designer and manufacturer. They provide both embedded solutions as well as wireless hardware solutions, including both the ES450 and GX450 devices. The AirLink ES450 is a LTE gateway designed for distributed enterprise. The ES450 is typically seen connecting Point-of-sale devices, remote SCADA equipment, or other business critical equipment. The AirLink ES450 also provides a terminal server for remote out-of-band administration.

ACEManager is the web server included with the AirLink ES450. This web server is responsible for the majority of interactions in the device. Some specific capabilities of the web server are routing, device reconfiguration, user authentication and certificate management. The vendor has stated that the ACEManager web application is not accessible by default from the Cellular WAN.

The webserver ACEManager is lacking the presence of a cross-site request forgery prevent header. As seen in the request below, there are no headers provided to check for cross-site request forgery. These headers would provide the server the ability to check that requests are coming from a similar session in a coherent manner, instead of coming from a link of an unrelated browser that is capitalizing on a pre-authenticated session.
