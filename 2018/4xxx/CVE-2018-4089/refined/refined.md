Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-4089:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A use-after-free vulnerability exists within the WebKit component, specifically in how `SVGPropertyTearOff` manages pointers to SVG properties. When `detachWrapper()` is called, the pointer to the SVG property stored in `m_value` is dereferenced. If this pointer points to memory that has been freed (because a Vector containing the list of values was reallocated), a use-after-free occurs. This can happen when an SVG property is a list of values, and that list is resized.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability in `SVGPropertyTearOff`.
- Incorrect memory management during resizing operations within SVG list properties.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution as a result of memory corruption.
- Denial of Service via crashing the application

**Attack vectors:**
- Processing maliciously crafted web content.
- Specifically, crafted SVG content that manipulates list properties, can trigger the UAF by resizing the underlying vector of properties before `detachWrapper()` is called on a `SVGPropertyTearOff` object.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide/serve malicious web content to a vulnerable system (e.g., via a malicious website, or a compromised webpage).
- No special privileges needed, just needs to get a vulnerable application to process the malicious SVG content.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was identified on an ASan build of WebKit revision 225572 on macOS, as mentioned in the exploit-db entry.
- The exploit-db entry includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit.
- The vulnerability is triggered within the context of SVG animations, specifically when SVG elements with animated list properties are processed.
- The issue can be triggered by resizing the vector holding the property values before detachWrapper() is called.

The fix involves improved memory handling.
