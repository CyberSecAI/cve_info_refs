The provided content is related to CVE-2018-4071.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the `Embedded_Ace_TLGet_Task.cgi` executable not having restricted configuration settings, allowing an authenticated user to retrieve MSCII configuration values through the `/cgi-bin/Embedded_Ace_TLGet_Task.cgi` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Information Disclosure: The `Embedded_Ace_TLGet_Task.cgi` allows an authenticated user to retrieve sensitive information like plaintext passwords and SNMP community strings.
- Lack of access control: The CGI executable does not enforce access control, allowing any authenticated user to retrieve any configuration on the device.
- Executable permission: The executable has `-rwxr-xr-x` permissions, allowing execution outside of the web UI.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can retrieve sensitive information, including plaintext passwords and SNMP community strings.
- An attacker can retrieve any configuration on the device, potentially leading to further attacks.
- A low-privilege user can retrieve the password of other users and gain higher privileges.
- Exposure of system configurations, which can lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the `/cgi-bin/Embedded_Ace_TLGet_Task.cgi` endpoint.
- Executing the binary directly, such as when a user logs in via SSH.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to authenticate to the web server.
- The attacker needs to know the correct MSCIID values to request sensitive configuration data.
- The attacker can be a low-privilege user once authenticated.
