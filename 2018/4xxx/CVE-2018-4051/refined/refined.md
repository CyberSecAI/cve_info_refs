- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in the `createFolderAtPath` function of the privileged helper tool of GOG Galaxy. This function takes a path as input and creates a folder at that location, including any necessary nested directories.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `createFolderAtPath` function does not properly validate the input path, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary paths on the root file system. The created directories have global read, write, and execute permissions, with root wheel ownership.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can create arbitrary directories and subdirectories on the root file system, as well as modify the permissions of existing directories. This leads to local privilege escalation, allowing the attacker to potentially take control of the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted path to the `createFolderAtPath` function of the GOG Galaxy helper tool. This tool is a service that runs with root privileges and is listening for connections.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the vulnerable GOG Galaxy helper tool to send the malicious path. This indicates the attack is local.
