SUMMARY

IEC 61850 system conﬁgurator, DIGSI 5, DIGSI 4, SICAM PAS/PQS, SICAM PQ Analyzer, and SICAM
SCC products are affected by a security vulnerability which could allow an attacker to either exﬁltrate
limited data from the system or to execute code with operating system user permissions.

Siemens has released updates for several affected products, and recommends that customers update to
the new version. Siemens is preparing further updates and recommends speciﬁc countermeasures until
patches are available.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Change ﬁrewall conﬁguration to restrict access to port 4884/TCP, 5885/TCP or 5886/TCP to

localhost (depending on the affected product in use).

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

• Follow Secure Substations security guidelines https://www.siemens.com/gridsecurity

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate
mechanisms (e.g. ﬁrewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to conﬁgure the environment according to
our operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

Recommended security guidelines to Secure Substations can be found at:

https://www.siemens.com/gridsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The IEC 61850 system conﬁgurator is a manufacturer-neutral solution for the interoperable engineering
of IEC 61850 products and systems.

DIGSI 5 is the operation and conﬁguration software for SIPROTEC 5 protection devices.

DIGSI 4 is the operation and conﬁguration software for SIPROTEC 4 and SIPROTEC Compact protection
devices.

SICAM PAS/PQS is an energy automation solution for operating an electrical substation with its devices.

SICAM PQ Analyzer is a power quality system software that provides options to evaluate archived PQ
measuring data and fault records.

SICAM SCC is a process and visualization system for energy automation solutions.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.0
(CVSS v3.0) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-4858

A service of the affected products listening on all of the host’s network interfaces on either port
4884/TCP, 5885/TCP, or port 5886/TCP could allow an attacker to either exﬁltrate limited data from the
system or to execute code with Microsoft Windows user permissions.

Successful exploitation requires an attacker to be able to send a specially crafted network request to
the vulnerable service and a user interacting with the service’s client application on the host. In order
to execute arbitrary code with Microsoft Windows user permissions, an attacker must be able to plant
the code in advance on the host by other means. The vulnerability has limited impact to conﬁdentiality
and integrity of the affected system.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.
Siemens conﬁrms the security vulnerability and provides mitigations to resolve the security issue.

For additional information see Siemens’ security advisory SSA-159860 at the following location:

<http://www.siemens.com/cert/en/cert-security-advisories.htm>

NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS-CERT website](/ics/) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

NCCIC also recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:

* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.
* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](/reading_room/emailscams_0905.pdf) for more information on avoiding email scams.
* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](/cas/tips/ST04-014.html) for more information on social engineering attacks.

No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. High skill level is needed to exploit.
