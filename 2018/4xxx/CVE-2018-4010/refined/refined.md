- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The ProtonVPN client failed to properly sanitize OpenVPN configuration files, allowing an attacker to bypass the intended restrictions and inject malicious commands through the use of quotation marks around blocked directives.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: OS Command Injection (CWE-78) due to insufficient input sanitization of OpenVPN configuration files. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the fact that the client's validator does not account for the usage of quotation marks in the configuration file, which are parsed by OpenVPN.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with system-level privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted OpenVPN configuration file containing malicious commands is loaded by the client. The vulnerability is triggered when the GUI requests the service to execute OpenVPN with this malicious configuration file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to create or modify the OpenVPN configuration file, which the ProtonVPN client will use, which could be possible through social engineering or by controlling a local resource. Local access to the system and user privileges are required.
