- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in the `disableLaunchdAgentAtPath` function of the helper protocol in Clean My Mac X. The application directly passes user-provided file paths to `launchtl` without validating the calling application, allowing unprivileged users to execute commands as root.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Privilege escalation due to lack of input validation and improper privilege boundary crossing, allowing non-root users to uninstall launchd scripts as root.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can modify the file system as root, leading to potential compromise of the system by modifying system configurations, or removing critical system services.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability. Any application can access the vulnerable function due to the lack of calling application validation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access to the machine and ability to run an application or script that interacts with the vulnerable function.
