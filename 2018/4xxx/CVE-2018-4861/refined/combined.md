SSA-977428: Vulnerabilities in SCALANCE M875

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.0 Base Score: 7.5

SUMMARY

Multiple vulnerabilities have been identiﬁed in the web interface of SCALANCE M875. The web interface
of SCALANCE M875 could allow Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS),
or command injection attacks if an attacker is authenticated or tricks a legitimate authenticated user into
accessing a malicious link.

Siemens recommends customers to upgrade their hardware, and provides mitigations until hardware
upgrades can be applied.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

Affected Product and Versions

Remediation

SCALANCE M875:
All versions

Upgrade hardware to SCALANCE M876-4 or
RUGGEDCOM RM1224, or follow recommenda-
tions from Section Workarounds and Mitigations.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict access to the web-based management interface to the internal or VPN network.

• Use the built-in ﬁrewall to further restrict access to the web interface to trusted IP addresses if

possible.

• Protect administrative user account with strong passwords.

• Do not browse other websites and do not click on external links while being authenticated to the

administrative web interface.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SCALANCE M industrial routers are used for secure remote access to plants via mobile networks,
e.g. GPRS or UMTS with the integrated security functions of a ﬁrewall for protection against unauthorized
access and VPN to protect data transmission.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.0
(CVSS v3.0) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-4859

An authenticated remote attacker with access to the web interface (443/tcp), could execute arbitrary
operating system commands.

Successful exploitation requires that the attacker has network access to the web interface. The
attacker must be authenticated as administrative user to exploit the security vulnerability.

The vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-4861

An authenticated remote attacker with access to the web interface (443/tcp), could potentially read
and download arbitrary ﬁles from the device’s ﬁle system.

Successful exploitation requires that the attacker has network access to the web interface. The
attacker must be authenticated as administrative user to exploit the security vulnerability.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-11447

The web interface on port 443/tcp could allow a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack if an
unsuspecting user is tricked into accessing a malicious link.

Successful exploitation requires user interaction by an legitimate user, who must be authenticated to
the web interface as administrative user. A successful attack could allow an attacker to interact with
the web interface as an administrative user. This could allow the attacker to read or modify the device
conﬁguration, or to exploit other vulnerabilities that require authentication as administrative user.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-11448

The web interface on port 443/tcp could allow a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack if an
unsuspecting user is tricked into accessing a malicious link.

Successful exploitation requires that the attacker has access to the web interface of an affected
device. The attacker must be authenticated as administrative user on the web interface. Afterwards, a
legitimate user must access the web interface.

A successful attack could allow an attacker to execute malicious code in the browser of a legitimate
user.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-11449

An attacker with access to the local ﬁle system might obtain passwords for administratrive users.

Successful exploitation requires read access to ﬁles on the local ﬁle system. A successful attack could
allow an attacker to obtain administrative passwords.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.
