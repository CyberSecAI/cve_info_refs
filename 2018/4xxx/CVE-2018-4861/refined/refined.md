Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-4861:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability allows an authenticated remote attacker with access to the web interface to potentially read and download arbitrary files from the device's file system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read/Download:** The primary weakness is the ability to access and retrieve files from the device's file system without proper authorization checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read sensitive files, potentially exposing configuration details, credentials, or other confidential data stored on the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web interface (port 443/tcp).
*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated as an administrative user on the web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have network connectivity to the vulnerable device's web interface.
*   The attacker must possess valid administrative credentials for the web interface.
