{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2018-4087",
    "description": "A memory corruption issue was addressed with improved memory handling.",
    "affected_products": [
      "Apple tvOS 11.2.5",
      "Apple iOS 11.2.5",
      "Apple watchOS 4.2.2"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the `bluetoothd` daemon handles session tokens. The session token, intended for identifying clients, was incorrectly implemented using the actual mach port, making it predictable and allowing for brute-forcing.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption due to improper handling of session tokens in Core Bluetooth.",
       "Predictable session tokens due to using the mach port as the session identifier."
    ],
    "impact": "An application can execute arbitrary code with system privileges. A malicious app running in a sandboxed context can register a new callback on clients of `bluetoothd`, which have different sandbox contexts. This allows hijacking the session between `bluetoothd` and its clients.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious application can communicate with the `bluetoothd` daemon using mach messages.",
      "The application bruteforces the session tokens (mach ports) used by legitimate clients of `bluetoothd`."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to execute code within a sandboxed app, and have the ability to bruteforce mach ports.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability allows a malicious app to add callbacks on clients of `bluetoothd`, giving attackers access to other processes, such as SpringBoard, mDNSResponder, wifid, etc. This can lead to privilege escalation by using the leaked mach ports of clients."
