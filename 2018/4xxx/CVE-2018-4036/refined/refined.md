- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in the `removeKextAtPath` functionality of the CleanMyMac X helper tool.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The privileged helper tool lacks validation of the calling application, allowing any application to access and execute the `removeKextAtPath` function as root. This enables non-root users to remove kernel extensions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can remove kernel extensions running on the system and delete them from the system directory, potentially causing system instability or other malicious impacts.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required to exploit the vulnerability. Any application can call the vulnerable function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system. No specific privileges are needed besides the ability to execute code. The provided proof of concept requires an admin password to set up root files, but not for the actual exploit.
