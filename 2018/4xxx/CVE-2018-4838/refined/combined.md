As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens operational guidelines for Industrial Security](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/operational-guidelines-industrial-security.pdf) and following the recommendations in the product manuals.

Recommended security guidelines to secure substations and defense in depth can be found at:  <https://www.siemens.com/gridsecurity>.

For more information on these vulnerabilities and associated software updates, please see Siemens security advisory [SSA-203306](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-203306.pdf)

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices) in the technical information paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

SUMMARY

The EN100 Ethernet communication module, which is an optional extension for SIPROTEC 4, SIPRO-
TEC Compact and Reyrolle devices, allows an unauthenticated upload of ﬁrmware updates to the
communication module in affected versions.

Siemens has released updates for several affected products, is working on updates for the remaining
affected products, and recommends speciﬁc countermeasures until ﬁxes are available.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

SIPROTEC 4, SIPROTEC Compact and Reyrolle devices can be extended with an EN100 module.

For customers who are currently using the discontinued EN100-E or EN100-O modules, Siemens
recommends to upgrade to EN100-E+ or EN100-O+ modules in order to apply the ﬁrmware updates.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate
mechanisms (e.g. ﬁrewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to conﬁgure the environment according to
our operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

Recommended security guidelines to Secure Substations can be found at:

https://www.siemens.com/gridsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The EN100 Ethernet modules are used for enabling process communication on either IEC 61850,
PROFINET IO, Modbus TCP, DNP3 TCP or IEC 104 protocols via electrical/optical 100 Mbit interfaces on
SIPROTEC 4, SIPROTEC Compact and Reyrolle devices.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.0
(CVSS v3.0) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-4838

The web interface (TCP/80) of affected devices allows an unauthenticated user to upgrade or down-
grade the ﬁrmware of the device, including to older versions with known vulnerabilities.
