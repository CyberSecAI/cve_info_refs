- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in the `moveToTrashItemAtPath` function of the CleanMyMac X privileged helper tool. Specifically, the function does not validate the calling application and allows a user-supplied path to be passed to `advancedMoveItemAtPath`, which can delete the file if the fourth argument is nil.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Privilege escalation: A non-root user can execute code as root because the privileged helper tool does not validate the calling application.
    - Improper input validation: The `moveToTrashItemAtPath` function does not validate or sanitize the user-supplied path argument.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with local access can delete arbitrary files from the root file system as root.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker needs to craft a malicious application that calls the vulnerable `moveToTrashItemAtPath` function in the CleanMyMac X privileged helper tool.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Local access to the system where CleanMyMac X is installed.
    - Ability to run code on the system as a non-root user.
