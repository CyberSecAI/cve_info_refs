{
  "CVE-2018-4148": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A combination of an integer underflow, a logic flaw, and a lack of bounds checking when processing ETWS primary notifications.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Integer underflow: The segment number is cast to an unsigned 8-bit integer, leading to an underflow if a segment number of zero is processed.",
      "Logic flaw: The bitmask used to track received segments can be bypassed due to the integer underflow allowing an attacker to send an infinite number of segments.",
      "Buffer overflow: The `copy_etws_data_elem` function copies data into a fixed-size buffer without proper bounds checking, leading to a buffer overflow.",
       "Lack of input validation: The code does not validate if all segments were received according to the total segments count announced in the first segment."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution within the Intel modem.",
    "Attack vectors": "A rogue base station sending specially crafted ETWS primary notification messages.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be in physical proximity to the target device and operate a rogue base station.",
    "Additional details": "The vulnerability lies in the handling of ETWS primary notifications within GSM paging messages and GPRS packet paging messages. The vulnerability is triggered during reassembly of fragmented ETWS primary notification messages. A malicious sequence of messages can overwrite memory in the modem, allowing arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability affects all recent iPhone devices powered by the Intel XMM solution starting with the iPhone 7 until iOS 11.2.6, patched in iOS 11.3."
