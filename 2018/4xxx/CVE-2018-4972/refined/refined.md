Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-4972:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing Enhanced Metafile (EMF) files within Adobe Acrobat Pro DC. This improper validation leads to a read operation that goes beyond the bounds of an allocated memory object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The core issue is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which allows an attacker to access memory locations that are not intended to be accessed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to disclose sensitive information from the affected system. The information that can be disclosed is unspecified, but the vulnerability allows the attacker to read from memory locations beyond an allocated object.
- The advisory from ZDI notes that an attacker could leverage this vulnerability in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to achieve code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, which means the attacker does not need direct access to the victim's system.
- **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction, either by visiting a malicious webpage or opening a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious EMF file or webpage.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to interact with the malicious content, either by tricking them into visiting a website or opening a malicious PDF file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is classified as "Important" severity by Adobe, while ZDI has given the vulnerability a CVSS score of 4.3.
- The advisory mentions that Adobe has released an update to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported by Ke Liu of Tencent's Xuanwu LAB.
