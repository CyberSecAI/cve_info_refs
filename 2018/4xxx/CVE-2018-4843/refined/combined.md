SSA-592007: Denial of Service Vulnerability in Industrial Products

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 6.5

2018-03-20
2023-05-09
V2.1

SUMMARY

Several industrial controllers are affected by a security vulnerability that could allow an attacker to
cause a denial of service condition via PROFINET DCP network packets under certain circumstances.
Precondition for this scenario is a direct OSI Layer 2 access to the affected products. PROFIBUS
interfaces are not affected.

Siemens has released updates for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest
versions. Siemens recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet
available.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC CP 343-1 and CP 443-1 are communication processors (CP) designed to enable Ethernet
communication for SIMATIC S7-300/S7-400 CPUs.

SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU products have been designed for discrete and continuous control in industrial
environments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries worldwide.

SIMATIC S7-1500 Software Controller is a SIMATIC software controller for PC-based automation solutions.

SIMATIC S7-300 controllers have been designed for discrete and continuous control in industrial environ-
ments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries worldwide.

SIMATIC S7-400 controllers have been designed for discrete and continuous control in industrial environ-
ments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries worldwide.

SIMATIC WinAC RTX is a SIMATIC software controller for PC-based automation solutions.

SINUMERIK CNC offers automation solutions for the shop ﬂoor, job shops and large serial production
environments.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

Softnet PROFINET IO for PC-based Windows systems allows setting up open control solutions on
standard PC hardware.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-4843

Responding to a PROFINET DCP request with a specially crafted PROFINET DCP packet could
cause a denial of service condition of the requesting system.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker located on the same Ethernet segment
(OSI Layer 2) as the targeted device. A manual restart is required to recover the system.
