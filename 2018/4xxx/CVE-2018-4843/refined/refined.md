- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation when processing PROFINET DCP network packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of PROFINET DCP packets, specifically when responding to a request.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause a denial of service condition on the targeted device. The system requires a manual restart to recover from this state.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through specially crafted PROFINET DCP network packets.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be on the same Ethernet segment (OSI Layer 2) as the vulnerable device to exploit this vulnerability.
