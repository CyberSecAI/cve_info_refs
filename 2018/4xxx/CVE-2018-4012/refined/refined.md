- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `bc_http_read_header` function in the Webroot BrightCloud SDK does not properly handle overlong HTTP headers. It reads data from a socket using `bc_net_readline` and stores it in a global buffer (`HeaderBuf`). This function doesn't check the size of the destination buffer, which leads to a buffer overflow if the header is larger than the buffer size.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution. An attacker can write past the `HeaderBuf` buffer, overwriting data in the `.bss` section, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with `root` user privileges. This is achieved by sending crafted HTTP responses to a device using the vulnerable SDK.
- **Attack vectors**: Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack. An attacker can impersonate the remote BrightCloud server and send malicious, overlong HTTP headers to trigger the buffer overflow in the affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and modify network traffic between a device using the vulnerable Webroot BrightCloud SDK and the BrightCloud servers. For example, an attacker could perform a MitM attack on the network.
