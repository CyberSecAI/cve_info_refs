Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-4062:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of hard-coded credentials within the `snmpd.conf` files of the Sierra Wireless AirLink ES450. Specifically, the SNMP v3 user "sierra" with the password "12345678" and the authentication and privacy keys "abcdefgh" are hardcoded.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials:** The presence of hardcoded credentials for SNMP access.
- The snmpd service, when activated outside the WebUI, uses the hardcoded credentials

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privileged Access:** Successful exploitation grants an attacker read-write privileges to the device through SNMP.
- **Full SNMP access:** An attacker can perform a privileged `snmpwalk` of the device's MIB, potentially exposing sensitive configuration and status data.
- **Compromise of device:** The attacker can then potentially alter the configuration or behavior of the device, given the read/write access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the device to send SNMP requests.
- **SNMP Service Activation:** The snmpd service needs to be running on the device. This can be triggered via a root shell or using another exploit. The vulnerability specifically triggers when the service is started outside of the WebUI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the vulnerable device.
- **Knowledge of Hardcoded Credentials:** The attacker must be aware of the hardcoded SNMP v3 user "sierra" and its associated password and keys.
- **Ability to activate the service:** The attacker needs the ability to start the SNMP service outside the WebUI (e.g. via other exploits or root shell access) to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Sierra Wireless AirLink ES450 FW 4.9.3, and likely affects the AirLink GX450 product as well.
- The hardcoded user "sierra" has read-write privileges for the device.
- The vulnerability is triggered when `snmpd` is started outside of the web UI, because if SNMP is activated through the WebUI, configuration files are overwritten.
- The vendor was notified, and mitigation recommendations include upgrading to the latest version of the affected products.
