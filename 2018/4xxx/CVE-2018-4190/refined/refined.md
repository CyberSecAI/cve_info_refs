Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2018-4190:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from how WebKit handles fetching CSS mask images. Credentials were being unexpectedly sent during the process.

**Weakness:**
The core weakness is that credentials were being sent when fetching CSS mask images, potentially exposing sensitive information. This is a violation of the principle of least privilege and can lead to unintended data leaks.

**Impact:**
Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to the leakage of sensitive data. Specifically, user credentials could be exposed to malicious websites when fetching CSS mask images.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is visiting a maliciously crafted website. The website would need to exploit how WebKit fetches CSS mask images, leading to the unintended transmission of credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to host or control a malicious website that can be visited by the victim. No specific privileged access to the victim's system is required; the attacker leverages the user's interaction with the crafted website.

**Summary:**
CVE-2018-4190 is a vulnerability in WebKit where credentials could be unintentionally sent when fetching CSS mask images from a website. This could lead to sensitive information leakage if a user visits a malicious website crafted to exploit this flaw. The fix implemented is to use a CORS-enabled fetch method.
