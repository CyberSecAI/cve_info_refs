- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authentication for a critical function, specifically the firmware upload process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated firmware upload vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker could upload malicious firmware to the affected devices. This could lead to a complete compromise of the device, potentially disrupting its normal functionality, or allowing the attacker to use the device to gain further access to the network.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack. An attacker needs network access to the device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable device but does not require any prior authentication.
