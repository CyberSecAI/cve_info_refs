- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `changeFolderPermissionsAtPath` function in GOG Galaxy's privileged helper tool allows modification of folder permissions to be globally readable, writable, and executable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation in the `changeFolderPermissionsAtPath` function. The function does not properly validate or sanitize the path provided as an argument, allowing it to be set to arbitrary locations.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can use this vulnerability to escalate privileges by modifying permissions on privileged directories, ultimately leading to the execution of arbitrary code with elevated privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Local exploitation. An attacker needs to be able to interact with the helper tool service on the local machine.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker must have access to a system with the vulnerable version of GOG Galaxy installed, and must be able to communicate with the local helper tool service.
