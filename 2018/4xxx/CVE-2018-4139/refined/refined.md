Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2018-4139:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Double `mach_port_deallocate` in kextd due to failure to comply with MIG ownership rules.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The `_kextmanager_unlock_kextload` function in kextd, exposed via MIG, deallocates the `client` port using `mach_port_deallocate`.
- When the client has UID 0 but provides an invalid client port, the function drops a UREF (user reference) on the client port but returns `KERN_FAILURE`.
- Due to how MIG handles `KERN_FAILURE`, it releases all resources, causing `mach_port_deallocate` to be called again on the client port, resulting in a double deallocation.
- This can lead to a use-after-free condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can drop an extra UREF on any send rights in kextd for which the attacker also has a send right.
- This could cause a name for a privileged service to be deallocated.
- The attacker can then cause the name to be reused to name a port they control.
- Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a privilege escalation. Specifically, from unentitled root to root with `com.apple.rootless.kext-management` and `com.apple.rootless.storage.KernelExtensionManagement` entitlements. These entitlements could be equal to kernel code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable MIG service `com.apple.KernelExtensionServer`.
- The attacker needs to have root privileges but lacks the `com.apple.rootless.kext-management` and `com.apple.rootless.storage.KernelExtensionManagement` entitlements.
- The attacker sends an invalid client port, triggering the double deallocation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Root privileges.
- Ability to communicate with the `com.apple.KernelExtensionServer` MIG interface.
- Send rights on a mach port which is also known to `kextd`.
- Understanding of MIG and mach port semantics.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable due to a similar issue described in a 2016 write-up for "mach_portal".
- The bug was tested on macOS 10.13.2.
- The provided exploit is a proof-of-concept.
- The fix is present in macOS High Sierra 10.13.4 and later.

The information from Exploit-DB provides more context and exploit details compared to the Apple security advisory, which only mentions "A logic issue existed resulting in memory corruption. This was addressed with improved state management."
