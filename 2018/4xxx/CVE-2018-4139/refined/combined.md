# Apple macOS 10.13.2 - Double mach\_port\_deallocate in kextd due to Failure to Comply with MIG Ownership Rules

#### EDB-ID:

###### 44561

#### CVE:

###### [2018-4139](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-4139)

---

**EDB Verified:**

#### Author:

###### [Google Security Research](/?author=7725)

#### Type:

###### [dos](/?type=dos)

---

#### Platform:

###### [macOS](/?platform=macos)

**Vulnerable App:**

```
Here's a kextd method exposed via MIG (com.apple.KernelExtensionServer)

  kern_return_t _kextmanager_unlock_kextload(
      mach_port_t server,
      mach_port_t client)
  {
      kern_return_t mig_result = KERN_FAILURE;

      if (gClientUID != 0) {
          OSKextLog(/* kext */ NULL,
              kOSKextLogErrorLevel | kOSKextLogIPCFlag,
              "Non-root kextutil doesn't need to lock/unlock.");
          mig_result = KERN_SUCCESS;
          goto finish;
      }

      if (client != (mach_port_t)dispatch_source_get_handle(_gKextutilLock)) {
          OSKextLog(/* kext */ NULL,
              kOSKextLogErrorLevel | kOSKextLogIPCFlag,
              "%d not used to lock for kextutil.", client);
          goto finish;
      }

      removeKextutilLock();

      mig_result = KERN_SUCCESS;

  finish:
      // we don't need the extra send right added by MiG
      mach_port_deallocate(mach_task_self(), client);

      return mig_result;
  }

If the client has UID 0 but passes an invalid client port this code will
drop a UREF on client port then return KERN_FAILURE.

Returning KERN_FAILURE in MIG means all resources will be released which will
cause client to be passed to mach_port_deallocate again, even though only
one UREF was taken.

You'll have to use a debugger attached to kextd to see this behaviour.

This class of bug is exploitable; please see the writeup for mach_portal from 2016
where I exploited a similar issue [https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=959]
The TL;DR is that an attacker can drop an extra UREF on any send rights in kextd for which the
attacker also has a send right; you could use this to cause a name for a privileged service
to be deallocated then cause the name to be reused to name a port you control.

Exploitation of this would be a privesc from unentitled root to root with
com.apple.rootless.kext-management and com.apple.rootless.storage.KernelExtensionManagement entitlements,
which at least last time I looked was equal to kernel code execution.

tested on MacOS 10.13.2

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
