- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Anker Roav A1 Dashcam uses a hardcoded default password ("goroavcam") for its Wi-Fi Access Point (AP).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Use of Hard-coded Credentials (CWE-798): The device ships with a default password that is easily discovered.
    - Lack of Authentication: The Wi-Fi AP only requires the default password for access, without any additional layers of security.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who knows the default password can connect to the dashcam's Wi-Fi AP and potentially access its settings, download videos, or perform other actions as if they were the legitimate user. This could lead to information disclosure, modification of the device's settings, and potentially other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to be within Wi-Fi range of the dashcam when its AP is enabled.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be physically close enough to the dashcam to connect to its Wi-Fi AP and must know the default password. The Wi-Fi AP function needs to be manually enabled on the dashcam.
