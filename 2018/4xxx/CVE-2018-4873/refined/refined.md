CVE-2018-4873:
  - Root cause: Unquoted Search Path
  - Weakness: The application uses an unquoted search path, which can be exploited by placing a malicious executable in a directory within the search path.
  - Impact: Privilege Escalation
  - Attack vector: An attacker can gain elevated privileges by placing a malicious executable in a directory in the search path. The unquoted search path allows the application to load the malicious executable instead of the intended one.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to have the ability to write files to a directory that is part of the unquoted search path used by the application.
  - Fix Information: This vulnerability was resolved in version 4.3.0.256 of the Creative Cloud Desktop application.
