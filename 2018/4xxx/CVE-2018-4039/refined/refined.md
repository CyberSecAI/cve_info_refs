**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `inflate_table` function where code lengths from a PNG image are processed and used to update a count array. The application fails to validate that these code lengths are less than or equal to 15. This allows an attacker to provide code lengths greater than 15.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index:** The application does not properly validate the code lengths, which leads to out-of-bounds write.
- **Out-of-bounds write:** Specifically within the `inflate_table` function, the code lengths are used as indices to update a 64-byte count array, and the lack of validation on the lengths allows an attacker-controlled index to write beyond the bounds of this array.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory corruption: By writing outside the bounds of the count array, an attacker can corrupt memory, leading to a crash. This can be further leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution under the context of the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious document containing a specially crafted PNG image.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to convince a victim to open a specially crafted document in the vulnerable application.
