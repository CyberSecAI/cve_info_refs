CUPS 2.2.10 is a bug fix release that addresses issues in the scheduler, IPP Everywhere support, CUPS library, and USB printer support. Changes include:

* [CVE-2018-4300](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7w9x-rg6m-2fh9 "CVE-2018-4300"): Linux session cookies used a predictable random number seed.
* The `lpoptions` command now works with IPP Everywhere printers that have not yet been added as local queues (Issue [#5045](https://github.com/apple/cups/issues/5045))
* Added USB quirk rules (Issue [#5395](https://github.com/apple/cups/issues/5395), Issue [#5443](https://github.com/apple/cups/issues/5443))
* The generated PPD files for IPP Everywhere printers did not contain the cupsManualCopies keyword (Issue [#5433](https://github.com/apple/cups/issues/5433))
* Kerberos credentials might be truncated (Issue [#5435](https://github.com/apple/cups/pull/5435))
* The handling of `MaxJobTime 0` did not match the documentation (Issue [#5438](https://github.com/apple/cups/issues/5438))
* Incorporated the page accounting changes from CUPS 2.3 (Issue [#5439](https://github.com/apple/cups/issues/5439))
* Fixed a bug adding a queue with the `-E` option (Issue [#5440](https://github.com/apple/cups/issues/5440))
* Fixed a crash bug when mapping PPD duplex options to IPP attributes (rdar://46183976)

Enjoy!

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
