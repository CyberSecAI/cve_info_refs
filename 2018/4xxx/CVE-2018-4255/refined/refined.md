- **Root cause:** An out-of-bounds read vulnerability existed in the AMD component of macOS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Out-of-bounds read, leading to potential disclosure of kernel memory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local user may be able to read kernel memory.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the affected macOS system.
