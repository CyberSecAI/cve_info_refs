Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-4920:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a **type confusion flaw** in Adobe Flash Player.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Type Confusion:** The vulnerability arises from incorrect handling of data types within the Flash Player, which can be exploited.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system. This means an attacker could potentially gain complete control over the affected machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted SWF File:** The primary attack vector involves the victim using Adobe Flash Player to play a malicious, specifically crafted SWF file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Unauthenticated Attacker:**  The attacker can be remote and doesn't need prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
*  **Crafted SWF:** The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious SWF file designed to trigger the type confusion flaw.
*   **Victim Interaction:** The victim needs to open the attacker's crafted SWF file using a vulnerable version of Adobe Flash Player

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in Adobe Flash Player version 29.0.0.113.
*   Red Hat issued a security advisory (RHSA-2018:0520) to address this issue in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Supplementary.

This information is consistent with the general description of a type confusion leading to remote code execution, as generally described for CVE-2018-4920.
