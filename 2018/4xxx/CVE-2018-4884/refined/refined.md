Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2018-4884:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the parsing of BMP images embedded within EMF files in Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.
- The root cause is the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing the BMP image data inside the EMF file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read:  The insufficient validation of the BMP image data can lead to a read operation past the end of an allocated memory buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to disclose sensitive information by reading data from memory outside the intended buffer.
- Possible Arbitrary Code Execution: The ZDI advisory mentions that this vulnerability could be combined with other vulnerabilities to achieve code execution. The Adobe advisory also indicates that out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities can lead to Remote Code Execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- User interaction is required.
- The target must open a malicious file containing a specially crafted EMF file with an embedded BMP image.
- The target can also visit a malicious page hosting the crafted EMF file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious EMF file containing a specially crafted BMP image, and deliver it to the target.
- The attacker needs to induce the user to open the malicious file with the vulnerable software (Adobe Acrobat Pro DC).
