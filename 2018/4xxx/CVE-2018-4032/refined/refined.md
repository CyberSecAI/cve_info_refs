- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in the `moveItemAtPath` function of the privileged helper tool used by CleanMyMac X. Specifically, the function does not validate the `to_path` argument, allowing an attacker to pass `nil` and delete the file specified in `at_path`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Improper input validation: The `moveItemAtPath` function does not validate the supplied path arguments.
    - Privilege escalation: The privileged helper tool runs as root, allowing a non-root user to execute privileged operations.
    - Lack of validation of the calling application, allowing any application to access this function.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - An attacker can delete arbitrary files from the root file system, leading to potential data loss or system instability.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Local access is required to exploit the vulnerability.
    - The attacker must be able to communicate with the privileged helper tool.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Local access to the machine.
    - Ability to communicate with the privileged helper tool.
