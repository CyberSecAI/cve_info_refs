- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An injection issue
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Input validation vulnerability leading to APFS volume password truncation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An APFS volume password may be unexpectedly truncated.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploiting an injection vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to be able to provide input to the system in order to cause the truncation.
