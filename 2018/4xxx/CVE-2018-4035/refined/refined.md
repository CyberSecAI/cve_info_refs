Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-4035

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper input validation in the `truncateFileAtPath` function of the CleanMyMac X privileged helper tool. Specifically, there's a lack of validation of the calling application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Privilege Escalation:**  A non-root user can invoke the `truncateFileAtPath` function, which runs with root privileges, allowing them to bypass access controls.
- **Improper Input Validation:** The function directly uses the user-provided file path argument without checking if the caller is authorized to use this function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can delete files from the root file system, potentially leading to system instability or data loss.
- The vulnerability can be used by a malicious program to achieve persistence or remove critical system files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required.
- Any application can call the vulnerable function, because there is no validation of the calling application.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have local access to the system where CleanMyMac X is installed.
- The attacker needs to be able to run their own application with user privileges.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable function `truncateFileAtPath` takes a user-supplied file path as input.
- The CleanMyMac X application uses a privileged helper tool running as root to perform operations that require elevated permissions.
- The function `objc_msgSend` is used to send the `truncateFileAtPath` message to the `NSFileManager` object.
