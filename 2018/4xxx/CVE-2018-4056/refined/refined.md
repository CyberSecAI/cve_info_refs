## CVE-2018-4056 Analysis

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2018-4056:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An SQL injection vulnerability exists in the coTURN administrator web portal. Specifically, the username provided during login is directly used in a SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The `usname` element from the login POST request is directly embedded into an SQL query: `select realm,password from admin_user where name='%s'`, leading to SQL injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL code to bypass authentication and gain access to the administrator web portal.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By gaining access to the web portal, attackers can perform administrative actions.
- **Server Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to a complete takeover of the TURN server, enabling further attacks like bypassing firewalls.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote exploitation:** Attackers can send a specially crafted POST request to the login page of the coTURN server's web interface.
- **Network Accessibility:** The vulnerability can be exploited over the network, particularly if the coTURN server is directly exposed to the internet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:**  The attacker needs network access to the coTURN server's web interface.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know how to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability, which involves crafting a malicious username.
- **No prior authentication:** The vulnerability can be exploited pre-authentication.

**Additional details from provided content:**
- The vulnerability exists in versions of coTURN prior to 4.5.0.9.
- The web interface is shared with production services, which prevents easy access filtering.
- Even if no administrators are configured, and the portal is deactivated, the vulnerability is still exploitable, allowing the attacker to reactivate the portal.
- The vulnerability exists in multiple database drivers: `dbd_mysql.c`, `dbd_pgsql.c`, and `dbd_sqlite.c`.
- A proof of concept (PoC) exploit is provided, illustrating the vulnerability.

**Mitigation:**
- The Debian security advisory (DSA-4373-1, DLA 1671-1) recommends disabling the web interface, indicating that a proper fix was not implemented. Instead, it suggests using the command line interface for administration.
- Upgrade to a version with a fixed SQL query, such as version 4.5.0.5-1+deb9u1 (for Debian Stretch) or 4.2.1.2-1+deb8u1 (for Debian Jessie).

This analysis provides a clear picture of the SQL injection vulnerability in coTURN, its impact, and the necessary steps for mitigation based on the provided information.
