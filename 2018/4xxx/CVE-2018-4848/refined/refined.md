- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The integrated configuration web server of the affected devices does not properly neutralize script-related HTML tags.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS))
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the web browser of a user visiting a malicious link, potentially affecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker must trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link, exploiting the XSS vulnerability in the web server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious link, and the victim must be logged into the web interface and tricked into clicking the malicious link.
