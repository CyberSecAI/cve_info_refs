Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to an OS command injection flaw in the Dreamweaver URI handler on Windows.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **OS Command Injection:** The application is susceptible to OS command injection through the URI handler. This means that an attacker can inject malicious commands that will be executed by the operating system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. This can lead to complete system compromise, data theft, malware installation, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the Dreamweaver URI handler. By crafting a malicious URI, an attacker can trigger the command injection vulnerability when the URI is processed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to get the target user to interact with a crafted malicious URI. This could be achieved via social engineering tactics such as tricking the user into clicking a link or by embedding a malicious link in a webpage.
