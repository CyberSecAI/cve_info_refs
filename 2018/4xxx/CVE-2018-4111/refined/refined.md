- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An issue existed in the handling of S/MIME HTML e-mail, specifically how remote resources were loaded in encrypted messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability is caused by the Mail application loading remote resources by default in S/MIME encrypted messages that do not have a valid or missing S/MIME signature.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with a privileged network position could exfiltrate the contents of S/MIME-encrypted emails by forcing the loading of remote resources in these messages.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a privileged network position, enabling the attacker to intercept and manipulate network traffic. This allows them to control the resources loaded by the Mail app when it processes an S/MIME encrypted email with a missing or invalid signature.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a privileged network position to intercept and potentially manipulate the network traffic.
