The content is related to CVE-2018-4064.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `ACEManager upload.cgi` functionality of Sierra Wireless AirLink ES450, specifically related to how it handles template uploads. The web server allows an authenticated user to change device settings, including the user password, via template upload without requiring the old password for verification.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unverified password change is the primary weakness. The system does not validate the old password before allowing a change of the user password via template upload. This is achieved by manipulating the MSCIID settings within the uploaded template.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to change the 'user' password of the device, gaining unauthorized access and control of the device.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can exploit this by sending a crafted HTTP request containing a malicious XML template, either via the WebUI template upload or directly using the HTTP requests shown in the report.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user. This means they must have valid credentials for the web interface in order to exploit the vulnerability.
