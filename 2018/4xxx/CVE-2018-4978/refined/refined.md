The provided document contains information about multiple CVEs, including CVE-2018-4978.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Heap Overflow

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a heap overflow, which occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer in the heap memory.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of the heap overflow vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user. This means an attacker could potentially run malicious code on the affected system.

**Attack vectors:** The document doesn't specify the exact attack vector, but heap overflows are generally triggered by providing crafted input that causes the program to write beyond buffer boundaries during memory operations. Likely related to a PDF processing issue.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to provide a specially crafted file (most likely a PDF) to an affected user. The user would need to open this file with a vulnerable version of Adobe Acrobat or Reader.
