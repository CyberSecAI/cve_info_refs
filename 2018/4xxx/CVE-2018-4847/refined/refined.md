- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient protection of sensitive information (e.g., session key) within the Siemens WinCC OA Operator iOS app.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unencrypted storage of sensitive data in the app's directory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with physical access to the mobile device could read the unencrypted data. This could potentially allow them to access the SIMATIC WinCC OA facility.
- **Attack vectors:** Physical access to the mobile device running the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs physical access to the mobile device.
