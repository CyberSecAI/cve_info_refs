- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Libraries were loaded with write and execute permissions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect file permissions allowed for unauthorized modification and execution of library files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A process may gain admin privileges and execute arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors**: A local attacker can modify the library files due to the write permissions, leading to arbitrary code execution within the context of the application using the vulnerable library.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the system and the ability to write to the vulnerable library files.
