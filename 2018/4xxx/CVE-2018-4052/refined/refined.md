- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in the `fillProcessInformationForPids` function of the GOG Galaxy helper tool. This function uses `proc_pidinfo` to gather process information, but fails to properly restrict access to processes based on privilege levels.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information leak due to the ability to retrieve information about processes running with higher privileges (e.g., root processes) than the user.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can obtain sensitive information about root processes running on the system. This information would usually only be accessible to the root user.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker sends an array of process IDs (PIDs) to the vulnerable `fillProcessInformationForPids` function via the helper tool's communication protocol. The vulnerability is triggered when the attacker supplies PIDs of privileged processes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the GOG Galaxy helper tool and pass it a crafted array of PIDs, including PIDs of root processes. The attacker needs to be local to the target machine.
