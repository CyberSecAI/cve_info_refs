Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-4090:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A memory initialization issue.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability lies in how the kernel initializes memory. This leads to the possibility of reading uninitialized memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An application may be able to read restricted memory.

**Attack vectors:**
An application running on the device can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to have the ability to run an application on the target device (Apple Watch, Apple TV, macOS, or iOS depending on the affected system)

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is present in watchOS 4.2.2, tvOS 11.2.5, macOS High Sierra 10.13.3, Security Update 2018-001 Sierra, Security Update 2018-001 El Capitan and iOS 11.2.5.
- The exploit-db entry provides more technical details, showing a stack leak through struct padding in the `sysctl_vfs_generic_conf` function in macOS. The vulnerability occurs due to uninitialized padding between `vfc_name` and `vfc_typenum` in the `vfsconf` struct. It allows reading uninitialized stack data.
