**Vulnerabilit****y:** Improper Access Control

## AFFECTED PRODUCTS

Siemens reports that this vulnerability affects the following products:

* SIMATIC WinCC OA UI for Android: All versions prior to V3.15.10, and
* SIMATIC WinCC OA UI for IOS: All versions prior to V3.15.10

## IMPACT

This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker who tricks an app user to connect to a malicious WinCC OA server. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to read and write data from and to the app’s project cache folder.

## MITIGATION

Siemens has provided the following updates for mitigation:

* SIMATIC WinCC OA UI for Android: Update to V3.15.10 which can be located here:

<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.siemens.winccoaui>

* SIMATIC WinCC OA UI for IOS: Update to V3.15.10 which can be located here:

<https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/simatic-wincc-oa-ui/id1073943068>

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that users can apply to reduce the risk:

For more information on this vulnerability and associated software updates, please see Siemens security notification SSA-822928 on their website:

<https://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories>

NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the NCCIC Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the [ICS-CERT website](/ics/).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

In addition, NCCIC recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:

* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.
* Refer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.
* Refer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.

No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. High skill level is needed to exploit.

## VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

## [IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)

Insufficient limitation of CONTROL script capabilities could allow read and write access from one HMI project cache folder to other HMI project cache folders within the app’s sandbox on the same mobile device. This includes HMI project cache folders of other configured WinCC OA servers.

This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker who tricks an app user to connect to a malicious WinCC OA server. This could give an attacker the ability to read and write data from and to the app’s project cache folder.

[CVE-2018-4844](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-4844) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:A/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)).

## RESEARCHER

Alexander Bolshev from IOActive, and Ivan Yushkevich from Embedi reported this vulnerability to Siemens.

SUMMARY

The latest update for the Android app and iOS app SIMATIC WinCC OA UI ﬁx a security vulnerability
which could allow read and write access from one HMI project cache folder to other HMI project cache
folders within the app’s sandbox on the same mobile device. This includes HMI project cache folders of
other conﬁgured WinCC OA servers. Precondition for this scenario is that an attacker tricks an app user
to connect to an attacker-controlled WinCC OA server.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Only connect to trusted WinCC OA Server

• Follow the SIMATIC WinCC OA Security Guideline (available at https://portal.etm.at/index.php?
option=com_phocadownload&view=category&id=52:security&Itemid=81) for maintaining a secured
SIMATIC WinCC OA environment.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices with
appropriate mechanisms. In order to run the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens particularly
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SIMATIC WinCC OA UI app allows remote access to a SIMATIC WinCC OA facility with the mobile
device. The app offers the same functionality as a remote user interface of WinCC OA.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.0
(CVSS v3.0) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-4844

Insufﬁcient limitation of CONTROL script capabilities could allow read and write access from one HMI
project cache folder to other HMI project cache folders within the app’s sandbox on the same mobile
device. This includes HMI project cache folders of other conﬁgured WinCC OA servers.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker who tricks an app user to connect to an
attacker-controlled WinCC OA server. Successful exploitation requires user interaction and read/write
access to the app’s folder on a mobile device. The vulnerability could allow reading data from and
writing data to the app’s folder.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.
Siemens conﬁrms the security vulnerability and provides mitigations to resolve the security issue.
