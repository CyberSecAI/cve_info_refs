- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect implementation of the authentication algorithm.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing or flawed authentication, allowing unauthorized access.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to cause a denial-of-service, read and manipulate data, and modify configuration settings of the affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote network access to port 80/tcp or port 443/tcp.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device. No prior authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
