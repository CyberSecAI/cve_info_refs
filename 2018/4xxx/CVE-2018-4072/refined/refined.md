Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2018-4072:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `Embedded_Ace_Set_Task.cgi` executable within the Sierra Wireless AirLink ES450 device's ACEManager web server. This executable is responsible for changing MSCII configuration values.
*   The root cause is the lack of restrictions on configuration settings that can be changed through this executable and improper permission assignment. Any authenticated user can send configuration changes to any system setting using the `/cgi-bin/Embedded_Ace_Set_Task.cgi` endpoint, once the MSCIID is discovered.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Permission Assignment:** The `Embedded_Ace_Set_Task.cgi` executable has `-rwxr-xr-x` permissions. This allows any user on the system, including low-privilege users, to execute the binary and modify system configurations outside of the intended web user interface.
*   **Lack of Input Validation/Authorization:** The `/cgi-bin/Embedded_Ace_Set_Task.cgi` endpoint does not validate or restrict which configuration settings can be modified, allowing arbitrary setting writes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can make an authenticated HTTP request, or run the binary as any user, to trigger this vulnerability, resulting in arbitrary setting writes
*   An attacker can change any configuration setting on the device, including:
    *   Changing user passwords.
    *   Enabling or disabling services.
    *   Modifying other system configurations.
*   This could lead to a complete compromise of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** An attacker with network access to the device can send a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/Embedded_Ace_Set_Task.cgi` endpoint, including the token and desired configuration changes.
*   **Local Access:** An attacker who has gained a low-privilege shell access (e.g., over SSH) to the device can directly execute the `Embedded_Ace_Set_Task.cgi` binary and modify system settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have valid login credentials for the device's web interface or SSH access.
*   **Network Access or local shell access:** The attacker needs network access to reach the web interface or local shell access to execute the binary.
*   **Knowledge of MSCIID**: The attacker needs to know the MSCIID of the setting they want to modify.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability can also be exploited via the `Embeded_Ace_TLSet_Task.cgi` endpoint, which is very similar, and designed for setting table values.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) Python script demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The issue is tracked as CVE-2018-4072 and also affects the AirLink GX450 product.
