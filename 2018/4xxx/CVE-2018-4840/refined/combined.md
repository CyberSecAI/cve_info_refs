SUMMARY

SIPROTEC 4 and SIPROTEC Compact devices could allow access authorization passwords to be
reconstructed or overwritten via engineering mechanisms that involve DIGSI 4 and EN100 Ethernet
communication modules.

Siemens has released updates for several affected products, and recommends speciﬁc countermeasures
for the remaining products.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

For customers who are currently using the discontinued EN100-E or EN100-O modules, Siemens
recommends to upgrade to EN100-E+ or EN100-O+ modules in order to apply the ﬁrmware updates.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Apply secure substation concept and Defense-in-Depth (see https://www.siemens.com/gridsecurity)

or contact customer care to ﬁnd speciﬁc solutions.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations to
build resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes. It is
therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures are
in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid’s reliability can thus be minimized by virtue of the
grid design.

Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling
and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated
means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly
recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff
of the update process in the target environment.

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate
mechanisms (e.g. ﬁrewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to conﬁgure the environment according to
our operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

DIGSI 4 is the operation and conﬁguration software for SIPROTEC 4 and SIPROTEC Compact protection
devices.

SIPROTEC 4 and SIPROTEC Compact devices provide a wide range of integrated protection, control,
measurement, and automation functions for electrical substations and other ﬁelds of application.

The EN100 Ethernet modules are used for enabling process communication on either IEC 61850,
PROFINET IO, Modbus TCP, DNP3 TCP or IEC 104 protocols via electrical/optical 100 Mbit interfaces on
SIPROTEC 4, SIPROTEC Compact, Reyrolle and SWT3000 devices.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-4839

An attacker with local access to the engineering system or in a privileged network position and able to
obtain certain network trafﬁc could possibly reconstruct access authorization passwords.

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens operational guidelines for Industrial Security](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/operational-guidelines-industrial-security.pdf) and following the recommendations in the product manuals.

Recommended security guidelines to secure substations and defense in depth can be found at:  <https://www.siemens.com/gridsecurity>.

For more information on these vulnerabilities and associated software updates, please see Siemens security advisory [SSA-203306](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-203306.pdf)

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices) in the technical information paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
