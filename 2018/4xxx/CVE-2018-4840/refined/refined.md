Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2018-4840:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing authentication mechanism in the device engineering process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306): The device engineering mechanism lacks proper authentication, allowing an attacker to perform critical operations without verification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can upload a modified device configuration, which overwrites access authorization passwords.
- This allows the attacker to potentially gain unauthorized access and control over the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.
- The attack complexity is low, meaning it is not difficult to exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any prior privileges or user interaction.
- They need network access to the affected devices.
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted message to the device to overwrite the configuration.
