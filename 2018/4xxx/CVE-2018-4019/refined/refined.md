- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper sanitization of user-supplied input within POST parameters (`powerd_normal_mode`, `powerd_ac_mode`, and `powerd_battery_mode`) in `system_advanced_misc.php`, leading to command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: OS Command Injection (CWE-78). The application directly incorporates user-provided data into shell commands without proper sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system with the privileges of the web server, potentially leading to full system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specially crafted, authenticated POST requests to the `/system_advanced_misc.php` endpoint with malicious values for the vulnerable parameters (`powerd_normal_mode`, `powerd_ac_mode`, and `powerd_battery_mode`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker must be able to send authenticated POST requests to the administration web interface. This requires prior access to the web interface, either through compromised credentials or other means.
