- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An attacker with network access to port 69/udp can modify the administrative client stored on the device.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The device allows modification of the administrative client via network access to port 69/udp. This modified client can then be downloaded and executed by a legitimate user.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Code execution on the client system.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access to port 69/udp on the affected device. The attacker modifies the administrative client stored on the device. A legitimate user downloads and executes the modified client.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to port 69/udp on the affected device. The attacker needs to be able to modify the administrative client stored on the device. The legitimate user needs to download and execute the malicious client.
