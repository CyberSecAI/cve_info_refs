The provided content contains information about CVE-2018-4311.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A cross-origin issue existed in WebKit, where `SecurityErrors` included the accessed frame's origin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability lies in the inclusion of the accessed frame's origin in `SecurityErrors`, which could potentially expose sensitive information across different origins.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Cross-origin SecurityErrors were exposing the origin of accessed frames. This could potentially be leveraged to leak sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**
A malicious website could craft specific scenarios that would trigger `SecurityErrors` and leak the origin of frames. This would be achieved through cross-origin access attempts using iframes.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to host a malicious website and convince a user to visit it. The attacker would then need to manipulate iframes to trigger the `SecurityErrors` to access frame origins.
