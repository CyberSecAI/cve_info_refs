- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The default configuration file, `defaults.xml`, containing sensitive information, including the default password in plain text, is accessible without authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure due to lack of access control on the `defaults.xml` file.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can obtain the default configuration of the device, including the default password, which can be used to gain unauthorized access and further compromise the device.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending an unauthenticated HTTP GET request to the `/defaults.xml` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs network access to the device and the ability to send HTTP requests. No authentication is needed.
