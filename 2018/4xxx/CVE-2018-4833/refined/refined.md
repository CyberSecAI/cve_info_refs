- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap-based buffer overflow exists in the handling of DHCP responses. A specially crafted DHCP response can cause a buffer overflow during processing.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged attacker can gain remote code execution with system privileges on the affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the network, specifically by sending a malicious DHCP response to a client's DHCP request within the same local network segment (OSI Layer 2).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be located in the same local network segment (OSI Layer 2) as the vulnerable device and be capable of sending spoofed DHCP responses.
