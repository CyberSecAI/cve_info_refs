SSA-181018: Heap Overﬂow Vulnerability in SCALANCE X switches,
RUGGEDCOM Win, RFID 181EIP, and SIMATIC RF182C

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.5

V1.6

SUMMARY

SCALANCE X switches, RUGGEDCOM Win, RFID 181EIP, and SIMATIC RF182C are affected by a
vulnerability that could allow an unprivileged attacker located in the same local network segment (OSI
Layer 2) to gain system privileges by sending a specially crafted DHCP response to a client’s DHCP
request.

Siemens has released updates for several affected products and recommends to update to the new
versions. Siemens is preparing further updates and recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for products
where updates are not, or not yet available.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Use static IP addresses instead of DHCP

• Apply cell protection concept: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-

security

• Apply Defense-in-Depth: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security

• For SIMATIC RF182C and RFID 181EIP: migrate to a successor product within the SIMATIC

RF18xC/CI family, V1.3 or later version. For details refer to the phase-out announcement.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SCALANCE X switches are used to connect industrial components like Programmable Logic Controllers
(PLCs) or Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs).

The SCALANCE X-204RNA Industrial Ethernet network access points enable the cost-effective connection
of non-PRP terminal devices to separate parallel networks, where a high availability is required.

RUGGEDCOM Win

RFID 181EIP is an RFID communication module for direct connection of SIMATIC identiﬁcation systems to
Ethernet/IP. RFID 181EIP is superseded by the SIMATIC RF18xC devices (RF185C, RF186C, RF188C).

SIMATIC RF182C is an RFID communication module for direct connection of SIMATIC identiﬁcation
systems to Ethernet/IP. SIMATIC RF182C is superseded by the SIMATIC RF18xC devices (RF185C,
RF186C, RF188C).

SIMATIC RF185C, RF186C/CI, and RF188C/CI are communication modules for direct connection of
SIMATIC identiﬁcation systems to PROFINET IO/Ethernet and OPC UA.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.
