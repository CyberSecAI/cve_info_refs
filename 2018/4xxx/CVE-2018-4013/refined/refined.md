Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2018-4013:

**Root Cause:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `lookForHeader` function within the LIVE555 RTSP server library when parsing HTTP headers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `lookForHeader` function is called multiple times with different header names.
- Inside `lookForHeader`, a loop iterates over the input, searching for the header name. When a match is found, the code copies the header value into a buffer using a while loop, bounded by newline characters ('\r' or '\n').
- After a successful copy, the code continues to the outer loop and starts looking for other header names again.
- The issue arises because although each copy is limited by the buffer size, there is no limit on how many times the copy can occur as long as the header name is found multiple times, and the destination address continues to increment, leading to a stack buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP packet. Specifically, the packet needs to include multiple instances of the same HTTP header ("Accept" or "x-sessioncookie") such that each copied header value is not too long but the combined copy of the headers overflows the buffer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send network traffic to a LIVE555 RTSP server that supports RTSP-over-HTTP tunneling.
- No prior authentication is required, making this vulnerability remotely exploitable.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs in the `RTSPServer::RTSPClientConnection::handleRequestBytes`, which parses incoming data. The code parses HTTP headers such as "Accept" and "x-sessioncookie" using the `lookForHeader` function.
- The `lookForHeader` function copies data into stack-allocated buffers, `sessionCookie` and `acceptStr`, both with a size of 200 bytes. Although each copy is limited to 200 bytes, multiple copies due to multiple instances of the header in the same request can cause a buffer overflow.
- The `parseHTTPRequestString` function calls the vulnerable `lookForHeader` function.

**Affected Versions:**
- Live Networks LIVE555 Media Server Version 0.92 is explicitly mentioned as vulnerable.
- Debian's `liblivemedia` package versions prior to 2016.11.28-1+deb9u1 (for stable/stretch) and 2014.01.13-1+deb8u1 (for Debian 8 "Jessie") are vulnerable.
- Gentoo's `media-plugins/live` package versions prior to 2020.03.06 are vulnerable.
