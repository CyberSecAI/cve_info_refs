Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-4898:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the improper parsing of XPS files within Adobe Acrobat Pro DC. Specifically, the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during XPS file processing can lead to a write operation beyond the boundaries of an allocated memory buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds write vulnerability: The software attempts to write data outside the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process, gaining control over the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- User interaction required: The target user must either visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. This suggests a crafted XPS file or a web page embedding such file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious XPS file or host a malicious web page that triggers the vulnerability when opened with a vulnerable version of Adobe Acrobat/Reader.
