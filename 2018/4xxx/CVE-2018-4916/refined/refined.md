Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-4916:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability stems from a heap-based buffer overflow within the parsing of TIFF images in Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.
* The core issue is the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length, heap-based buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Heap-based buffer overflow:**  This occurs when more data is written to a heap-allocated buffer than it can hold, leading to overwriting adjacent memory regions.
* **Insufficient input validation:** The application fails to check the size of the input data, allowing an attacker to provide overly long data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process running Adobe Acrobat Pro DC. This can lead to a complete compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Remote attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
* **User interaction required:** The attack requires the victim to either visit a malicious webpage or open a malicious file, such as a specially crafted TIFF image.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious TIFF image to the victim, either via a webpage or a file.
* No specific privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability, just user interaction to open the malicious file.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.
*   The vulnerability was reported to Adobe on January 19, 2018.
*   Adobe released an update to address this vulnerability.
