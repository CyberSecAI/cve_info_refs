- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `sysadminctl` command-line tool required passwords to be passed as arguments, which could expose them to other local users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Passwords were being passed directly in the arguments of the `sysadminctl` command, making them visible to other local users via tools like `ps`.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Passwords used with `sysadminctl` could be exposed to other local users.
- **Attack vectors**: Local users with the ability to monitor process arguments could potentially view the passwords.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be a local user on the system with access to command-line tools capable of displaying process arguments.
