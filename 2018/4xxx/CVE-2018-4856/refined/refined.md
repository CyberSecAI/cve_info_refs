- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An attacker with administrative access to the device's management interface can lock out legitimate users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control to the device management interface.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Legitimate users are locked out, requiring manual intervention to restore access. The availability of the device management interface is impacted.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access to the affected devices.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have administrative access to the device's management interface, and must be authenticated.
