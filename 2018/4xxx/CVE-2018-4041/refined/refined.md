- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in the `enableLaunchdAgentAtPath` function of the Clean My Mac X helper service. The function directly passes user-provided paths to `launchctl` without validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of input validation, privilege escalation. The helper service runs as root and allows non-root users to load arbitrary `launchd` scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain root privileges by loading malicious `launchd` scripts, leading to arbitrary file system modification with root privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access. Any application can call the vulnerable function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Local user access is required to exploit the vulnerability. No administrator credentials are required directly to trigger the exploit but are needed for setting up the root files for the demonstration of the exploit.
