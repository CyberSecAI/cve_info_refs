- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stack-based buffer overflow in the `fixup_path` function, which is called by the `XML_UploadFile` command handler. The `fixup_path` function copies the user-provided path to a fixed-size stack buffer without proper bounds checking.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121) in the `fixup_path` function.
    - Lack of bounds checking in the loop that copies the path, allowing an attacker to overwrite the return address and other stack data
    -  The HTTP interface requires no authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution on the device. By overflowing the stack buffer and overwriting the return address, an attacker can redirect program execution to their own malicious code.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted HTTP request to the webserver on the dashcam over Wi-Fi is sent when the "Wi-Fi AP" setting is enabled, by leveraging the `XML_UploadFile` command (5001), with a long path exceeding the stack buffer size.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be within Wi-Fi range of the device, connect to the "Roav_A1_" SSID with the default password, and send crafted HTTP requests to the device's webserver.
