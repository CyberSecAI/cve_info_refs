# XNU Kernel - Heap Overflow Due to Bad Bounds Checking in MPTCP

#### EDB-ID:

###### 44849

###### [2018-4241](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-4241)

**EDB Verified:**

#### Author:

###### [Google Security Research](/?author=7725)

**Vulnerable App:**

```
mptcp_usr_connectx is the handler for the connectx syscall for the AP_MULTIPATH socket family.

The logic of this function fails to correctly handle source and destination sockaddrs which aren't
AF_INET or AF_INET6:

// verify sa_len for AF_INET:

  if (dst->sa_family == AF_INET &&
      dst->sa_len != sizeof(mpte->__mpte_dst_v4)) {
    mptcplog((LOG_ERR, "%s IPv4 dst len %u\n", __func__,
        dst->sa_len),
       MPTCP_SOCKET_DBG, MPTCP_LOGLVL_ERR);
    error = EINVAL;
    goto out;
  }

// verify sa_len for AF_INET6:

  if (dst->sa_family == AF_INET6 &&
      dst->sa_len != sizeof(mpte->__mpte_dst_v6)) {
    mptcplog((LOG_ERR, "%s IPv6 dst len %u\n", __func__,
        dst->sa_len),
       MPTCP_SOCKET_DBG, MPTCP_LOGLVL_ERR);
    error = EINVAL;
    goto out;
  }

// code doesn't bail if sa_family was neither AF_INET nor AF_INET6

  if (!(mpte->mpte_flags & MPTE_SVCTYPE_CHECKED)) {
    if (mptcp_entitlement_check(mp_so) < 0) {
      error = EPERM;
      goto out;
    }

    mpte->mpte_flags |= MPTE_SVCTYPE_CHECKED;
  }

// memcpy with sa_len up to 255:

  if ((mp_so->so_state & (SS_ISCONNECTED|SS_ISCONNECTING)) == 0) {
    memcpy(&mpte->mpte_dst, dst, dst->sa_len);
  }

This PoC triggers the issue to overwrite the mpte_itfinfo field leading to a controlled pointer
being passed to kfree when the socket is closed.

Please note that these lengths seem to be trusted in multiple places - I would strongly suggest auditing
this code quite thoroughly, especially as mptcp can be reached from more places as of iOS 11.

Note that the MPTCP code does seem to be quite buggy; trying to get a nice PoC working for this buffer overflow
bug I accidentally triggered the following error path:

  error = socreate_internal(dom, so, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP, p,
          SOCF_ASYNC, PROC_NULL);
  mpte_lock(mpte);
  if (error) {
    mptcplog((LOG_ERR, "%s: subflow socreate mp_so 0x%llx unable to create subflow socket error %d\n",
        (u_int64_t)VM_KERNEL_ADDRPERM(mp_so), error),
       MPTCP_SOCKET_DBG, MPTCP_LOGLVL_ERR);

    proc_rele(p);

    mptcp_subflow_free(mpts);
    return (error);
  }

note that first argument to mptcplog has one too few arguments. It's probably not so interesting from a security
POV but is indicative of untested code (this error path has clearly never run as it will always kernel panic.)

This PoC is for MacOS but note that this code is reachable on iOS 11 from inside the app sandbox if you give yourself
the multipath entitlement (which app store apps can now use.)

Just run this PoC as root on MacOS for easy repro.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
