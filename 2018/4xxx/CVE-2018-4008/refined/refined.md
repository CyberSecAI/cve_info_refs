- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Shimo VPN helper tool's `RunVpncScript` command executes a user-supplied script argument with root privileges without proper validation of the script's path or ownership.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Improper input validation: The application does not validate the script path provided to `RunVpncScript`.
    - Privilege escalation: Arbitrary script execution as root.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with local access can execute arbitrary code with root privileges, leading to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the vulnerable machine is required. An attacker leverages the `RunVpncScript` command, providing a malicious script as an argument.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker must have local access to the target machine.
    - The attacker must be able to communicate with the helper service via Objective-C XPC calls.
