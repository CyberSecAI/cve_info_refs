Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2018-4980:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free error, specifically within the "Compare Files" tool of Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.
- It stems from a lack of validation regarding the existence of an object before operations are performed on it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-after-free: This occurs when the program attempts to access memory that has been freed, leading to unpredictable behavior and potential crashes or exploitable conditions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
- The code is executed in the context of the current user, meaning the attacker gains the same privileges as the user running the affected Adobe software.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote Attack: The attacker does not need to have local access to the machine to exploit the vulnerability.
- User Interaction: The target user must either visit a malicious web page or open a malicious file to trigger the vulnerability. This makes it a socially-engineered attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious PDF file that triggers the vulnerable code path.
- They also need to be able to get the victim to open this malicious file, typically through social engineering or phishing techniques.
