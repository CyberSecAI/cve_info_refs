{
  "CVE-2018-4121": {
    "Description": "Multiple memory corruption issues were addressed with improved memory handling.",
    "Root cause": "A vulnerability in WebAssembly parsing where the section ordering check `validateOrder()` does not adequately check that sections are in the correct order when a binary contains custom sections. If the previous section was a custom section, the check always returns true, even if the section is otherwise out of order. This allows for any number of sections to be parsed from a binary, any number of times in any order, leading to possible overflows and type confusion bugs.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "Impact": "Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Visiting a malicious website"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to serve or have the victim visit a website with malicious WebAssembly content."
