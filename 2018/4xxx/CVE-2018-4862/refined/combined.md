## Description

[![@slewis74](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4229735?v=4&size=48)](/slewis74)[slewis74](https://github.com/slewis74)opened [on Jan 3, 2018](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Issues/issues/4134#issue-285583867)

`CVE-2018-4862`

An authenticated user with `ProcessEdit` permission could reference an Azure account in such a way as to bypass the environment restrictions.

Relates to OctopusDeploy/OctopusDeploy#1711

# Octopus Account restrictions explained

Azure Accounts can be configured so it's available for use in any deployment. This is typical when you use the same Azure Subscription for everything. However, when you have multiple Azure Subscriptions you want to deploy to you need one Azure Account per subscription.

You might be happy to leave the Azure Accounts unrestricted and just resolve the correct account at deployment time using a variable binding. Otherwise you might decide to restrict each Azure Account so it can only be used for deployments targeting specific Environments or even for certain Tenants.

Octopus will actively prevent deployments that don't match the Azure Account's restrictions from using the Azure Account. This is useful when you want to actively prevent a deployment bound for your Test Environment / Test Azure Subscription from being deployed to your Production Azure Subscription.

# Vulnerability

An authenticated user with the `ProcessEdit` permission could craft their deployment process in a very specific way to reference an Account (Azure Accounts, Username Password Accounts, SSH Key Accounts) which would prevent Octopus from checking the restrictions correctly. Thus that authenticated user could use a restricted Account in the wrong context by accident or with malicious intent.

If you don't use Accounts you are not vulnerable.

If you use Accounts without any restrictions you are not vulnerable.

# Affected versions

Octopus Deploy `3.2.11` to `4.1.5`.

# Mitigation

Upgrade to Octopus `4.1.6`.

`CVE-2018-4862`

An authenticated user with `ProcessEdit` permission could reference an Azure account in such a way as to bypass the environment restrictions.

Relates to OctopusDeploy/OctopusDeploy#1711

# Octopus Account restrictions explained

Azure Accounts can be configured so it's available for use in any deployment. This is typical when you use the same Azure Subscription for everything. However, when you have multiple Azure Subscriptions you want to deploy to you need one Azure Account per subscription.

You might be happy to leave the Azure Accounts unrestricted and just resolve the correct account at deployment time using a variable binding. Otherwise you might decide to restrict each Azure Account so it can only be used for deployments targeting specific Environments or even for certain Tenants.

Octopus will actively prevent deployments that don't match the Azure Account's restrictions from using the Azure Account. This is useful when you want to actively prevent a deployment bound for your Test Environment / Test Azure Subscription from being deployed to your Production Azure Subscription.

# Vulnerability

An authenticated user with the `ProcessEdit` permission could craft their deployment process in a very specific way to reference an Account (Azure Accounts, Username Password Accounts, SSH Key Accounts) which would prevent Octopus from checking the restrictions correctly. Thus that authenticated user could use a restricted Account in the wrong context by accident or with malicious intent.

If you don't use Accounts you are not vulnerable.

If you use Accounts without any restrictions you are not vulnerable.

# Affected versions

Octopus Deploy `3.2.11` to `4.1.5`.

# Mitigation

Upgrade to Octopus `4.1.6`.
