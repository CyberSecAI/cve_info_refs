Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-4015:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Webroot BrightCloud SDK's default behavior when establishing HTTP connections. When a server address is provided without a protocol (e.g., "bcap15.brightcloud.com" instead of "https://bcap15.brightcloud.com"), the SDK defaults to using an insecure HTTP connection instead of HTTPS. This insecure default bypasses TLS certificate validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Certificate Validation (CWE-295):** The SDK fails to validate TLS certificates when using the default HTTP protocol, leaving the connection vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Insecure Default:** The SDK's default to HTTP when no protocol is specified is insecure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks:** An attacker positioned between the client and the BrightCloud server can intercept and modify traffic.
- **Credential Theft:** An attacker could steal credentials if they are transmitted over the unencrypted HTTP connection.
- **Altering BrightCloud Queries:** The attacker could modify queries to the BrightCloud API, potentially leading to incorrect categorization of URLs or bypass security protections.
- **Exploitation of SDK vulnerabilities:** In conjunction with other vulnerabilities (e.g., TALOS-2018-0683), this could lead to remote code execution on devices using the SDK.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** The primary attack vector is a man-in-the-middle attack. An attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between the client using the SDK and the BrightCloud server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Proximity:** The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the device using the SDK and the BrightCloud servers. This could be achieved by controlling a network node (e.g., a router) or being on the same network.
- **Traffic Interception:** The attacker needs the capability to intercept network communications and perform MitM attacks.
- **Ability to Impersonate a BrightCloud server:** The attacker must be able to present a fake BrightCloud server to the device, that is controlled by the attacker.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered in the context of the CUJO Smart Firewall, which uses the vulnerable Webroot BrightCloud SDK.
- The advisory explicitly states that the vulnerability exists in the Webroot BrightCloud SDK itself and affects any product that uses the vulnerable component.
- The provided CVSS v3 score is 8.1, which indicates a high severity.
- This vulnerability can be chained with other vulnerabilities, such as TALOS-2018-0683, to increase the impact (e.g. to achieve remote code execution).
