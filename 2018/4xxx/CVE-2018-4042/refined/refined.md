- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in the `removeLaunchdAgentAtPath` function of the Clean My Mac X helper service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - The helper service, which runs as root, does not properly validate the user-supplied path argument passed to `removeLaunchdAgentAtPath`.
  - There is no check on the calling application, allowing any application to invoke this function.
  - The service does not check if the path is a privileged file before attempting to remove it.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with local access can exploit this vulnerability to modify the file system as root by deleting arbitrary files through the helper service. Specifically, an attacker can remove privileged launchd agent configurations which can lead to the disabling of specific software features.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access via a malicious or compromised application that calls the vulnerable `removeLaunchdAgentAtPath` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target machine as a non-root user.
