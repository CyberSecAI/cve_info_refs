ReportCrash is the daemon responsible for making crash dumps of crashing userspace processes.
Most processes can talk to ReportCrash via their exception ports (either task or host level.)

You would normally never send a message yourself to ReportCrash but the kernel would do it
on your behalf when you crash. However using the task_get_exception_ports or host_get_exception_ports
MIG kernel methods you can get a send right to ReportCrash.

ReportCrash implements a mach_exc subsystem (2405) server and expects to receive
mach_exception_raise_state_identity messages. The handler for these messages is at +0x2b11 in 10.13.3.

The handler compares its euid with the sender's; if they are different it jumps straight to the error path:

__text:0000000100002BD5                 cmp     rbx, rax
__text:0000000100002BD8                 mov     r14d, 5

This error path drops a UREF on the task and thread port arguments then returns error code 5.

MIG will see this error and drop another UREF on the thread and port arguments. As detailed in
the mach_portal exploit [https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=959] such bugs can
be used to replace privileged port names leading to exploitable conditions.

Since this path will only be triggered if you can talk to a ReportCrash running with a different euid
a plausible exploitation scenario would be trying to pivot from code execution in a sandbox root process
to another one with more privileges (eg kextd on MacOS or amfid on iOS) going via ReportCrash (as ReportCrash
will get sent their task ports if you can crash them.)

This PoC demonstrates the bug by destroying ReportCrash's send right to logd; use a debugger or lsmp to see
what's happening.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
