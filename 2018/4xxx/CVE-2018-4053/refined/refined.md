- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation within the GOG Galaxy privileged helper tool. Specifically, the tool does not check the type or validity of a closure passed to it before using it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of input validation on the closure argument, leading to a null pointer dereference.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial-of-service (DoS). Exploiting this vulnerability causes the GOG Galaxy application to terminate and become unavailable.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending malicious data to the root-listening service via the application's protocol.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Local attacker able to communicate with the root listening service using the application's protocol.
