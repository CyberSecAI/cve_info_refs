SSA-468514: Improper Certiﬁcate Validation Vulnerability in Siveillance
VMS Video Mobile App for Android and iOS

SUMMARY

The latest update for the Siveillance VMS Video mobile app for Android and iOS ﬁxes a security
vulnerability that could allow an attacker in a privileged network position to read data from and write data
to the encrypted communication channel between the app and a server. Precondition for this scenario is
that an attacker is able to intercept the communication channel between the affected app and a server,
and is also able to generate a certiﬁcate that results for the validation algorithm in a checksum identical to
a trusted certiﬁcate.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has not identiﬁed any speciﬁc mitigations or workarounds.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to affected
products with appropriate mechanisms. It is advised to follow recommended security practices in order to
run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The Siveillance VMS Video Mobile Apps allow to view video from your Siveillance VMS system on your
Smartphone or Tablet.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.0
(CVSS v3.0) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be

individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-4849

Improper certiﬁcate validation could allow an attacker in a privileged network position to read data
from and write data to the encrypted communication channel between the app and a server.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker in a privileged network position which
allows intercepting the communication channel between the affected app and a server (such as
Man-in-the-Middle). Furthermore, an attacker must be able to generate a certiﬁcate that results for the
validation algorithm in a checksum identical to a trusted certiﬁcate. Successful exploitation requires
no user interaction. The vulnerability could allow reading data from and writing data to the encrypted
communication channel between the app and a server, impacting the communication’s conﬁdentiality
and integrity.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.
Siemens conﬁrms the security vulnerability and provides mitigations to resolve the security issue.
