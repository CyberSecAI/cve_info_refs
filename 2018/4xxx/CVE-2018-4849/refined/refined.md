- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper certificate validation. The application fails to properly validate the server's certificate.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application uses a validation algorithm that only checks a checksum of the certificate.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read and write data in the encrypted channel between the app and the server, thus impacting confidentiality and integrity.
- **Attack vectors:** Man-in-the-middle attack (intercepting the communication channel).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a privileged network position to intercept the communication between the app and the server. The attacker also needs to be able to generate a certificate with a checksum identical to a trusted certificate.
