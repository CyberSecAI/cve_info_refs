Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-4083:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper locking mechanisms within the `AppleEmbeddedOSSupportHostClient::registerNotificationPort` method. This method is responsible for managing notification ports, and the `IOUserClient` superclass does not implement necessary locking, leaving it up to the user client to prevent concurrent access issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Use-After-Free (UAF):** The core vulnerability is a use-after-free condition. Due to the lack of locking, concurrent calls to `registerNotificationPort` from multiple threads can lead to the same port being released multiple times, resulting in a double free and a use-after-free when the kernel attempts to access the freed memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution with System Privileges:** Successful exploitation allows a malicious application to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges. This represents a privilege escalation from a root user to the kernel. This means that an attacker, if able to gain root access, can exploit this vulnerability to gain full control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Exploit:** The vulnerability is triggered locally on the target machine.
- **Concurrent Access:** The exploit is achieved by calling the `registerNotificationPort` method concurrently from multiple threads. The provided code shows this using pthreads.
- **Targeted Kernel Extension:** The vulnerability resides in `AppleEmbeddedOSSupportHost.kext`, which is related to the communication with the touch bar on newer MacBook Pro models.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Root Privileges:** The attacker must have root access to the system to interact with `AppleEmbeddedOSSupportHostClient`.
- **Ability to Create Threads:** The attacker needs the ability to create and manage multiple threads to exploit the race condition.
- **Target System:** The target machine must have a touch bar since the vulnerable kext is related to touch bar support.

**Additional Details:**

- The exploit is triggered using the `IOConnectSetNotificationPort` IOKit function.
- The provided code demonstrates a working proof-of-concept for the exploit, including the necessary setup to trigger the vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2018-4083 is a local privilege escalation vulnerability due to a race condition leading to a use-after-free in the macOS kernel. An attacker with root privileges can exploit this to gain arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges on systems with a touch bar.
