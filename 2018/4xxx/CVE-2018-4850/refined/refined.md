- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The affected SIMATIC S7-400 CPUs improperly validate S7 communication packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20). The CPUs do not properly validate S7 communication packets, leading to a vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful attack can cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition, rendering the CPU in DEFECT mode until a manual restart. This impacts the availability of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted S7 communication packet to a communication interface of the CPU. This includes Ethernet, PROFIBUS, and Multi Point Interfaces (MPI).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted S7 communication packets to a communication interface of the CPU. No user interaction or privileges are required.
