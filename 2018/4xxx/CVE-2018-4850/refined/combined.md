SSA-914382: Denial-of-Service Vulnerability in SIMATIC S7-400 CPU
Family

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.5

2018-05-15
2020-02-10
V1.2

SUMMARY

SIMATIC S7-400 CPUs are affected by a security vulnerability which could lead to a Denial-of-Service
condition of the PLC if specially crafted packets are received and processed.

The affected SIMATIC S7-400 CPU hardware versions are in the product cancellation phase or already
phased-out. Siemens recommends customers either upgrading to a new version or implementing speciﬁc
countermeasures.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Apply cell protection concept: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-

security.

• Use VPN for protecting network communication between cells.

• Apply Defense-in-Depth: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens

recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Products in the SIMATIC S7-400 CPU family have been designed for process control in industrial
environments. They are used worldwide, e.g. in the automotive industry, mechanical equipment manu-
facture, warehousing systems, building engineering, steel industry, power generation and distribution,
pharmaceuticals, food and beverages industry, or chemical industry.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-4850

The affected CPUs improperly validate S7 communication packets which could cause a Denial-of-
Service condition of the CPU. The CPU will remain in DEFECT mode until manual restart.

Successful exploitation requires an attacker to be able to send a specially crafted S7 communication
packet to a communication interface of the CPU. This includes Ethernet, PROFIBUS, and Multi Point
Interfaces (MPI). No user interaction or privileges are required to exploit the security vulnerability. The
vulnerability could allow causing a Denial-of-Service condition of the core functionality of the CPU,
compromising the availability of the system.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.
Siemens conﬁrms the security vulnerability and provides mitigations to resolve the security issue.
