Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2018-4131:

**Root Cause:**
- An issue existed in `WindowServer` where an unprivileged application could log keystrokes entered into other applications, even when secure input mode was enabled, by scanning key states.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper state management within the `WindowServer` component.
- The system does not adequately prevent unprivileged applications from monitoring the key states of other applications, bypassing the intended security of "secure input mode."

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unprivileged application could gain the ability to log all keystrokes, including sensitive information like passwords and personal data, entered into other applications on the system. This could lead to the exfiltration of sensitive user information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local: An attacker would need to have a malicious application running on the targeted system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have an unprivileged application capable of scanning key states running on the target system. No additional privileges are required.
