Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause:** Out-of-bounds read

**Vulnerability:** An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists within Adobe Acrobat and Reader. This means the software attempts to read data from a memory location that is outside the allocated buffer or memory region.

**Impact:** This can lead to remote code execution. An attacker could potentially exploit this to run malicious code on the user's system.

**Attack Vector:** The document doesn't explicitly state the exact attack vector, but based on the product and vulnerability type, it would likely involve a specially crafted PDF document. By opening this malicious PDF file within a vulnerable version of Acrobat or Reader, an attacker can trigger the out-of-bounds read.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to create a malicious PDF file that triggers the out-of-bounds read and be able to convince a user to open it in a vulnerable version of Acrobat or Reader. No special access or privileges beyond that is required.
