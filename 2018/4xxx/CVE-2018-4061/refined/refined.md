Based on the provided documents, here's the information related to CVE-2018-4061:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `iplogging.cgi` script of the Sierra Wireless AirLink ES450's ACEManager web interface. The `-z` flag within the `tcpdumpParams` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing command injection. This flag is intended to provide a postrotate-command to `tcpdump` but lacks proper escaping or removal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary OS commands due to the lack of sanitization of the `-z` flag within the `tcpdumpParams` parameter in `iplogging.cgi`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands as root on the affected device.
- **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to a complete compromise of the device, potentially enabling attackers to:
    - Reconfigure the device.
    - Extract sensitive information.
    - Establish persistent access.
    - Disrupt operations.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/admin/tools/iplogging.cgi` endpoint.
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must be authenticated to the ACEManager web interface to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the device.
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs valid credentials for the ACEManager web interface.
- **Understanding of vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to target the vulnerable `tcpdumpParams` parameter and inject a malicious command using the `-z` flag.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects Sierra Wireless AirLink ES450 devices with firmware versions prior to 4.9.4, and likely affects the AirLink GX450 as well.
- The provided proof-of-concept exploit script demonstrates how to authenticate and inject a command using the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 9.1.
- This vulnerability was discovered and reported by Carl Hurd and Jared Rittle of Cisco Talos.
