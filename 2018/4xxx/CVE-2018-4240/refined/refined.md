Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-4240:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by an issue in how the Messages app handles and validates messages.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core vulnerability is a lack of proper message validation, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. Specifically, the issue arises from the processing of a maliciously crafted message containing a large number of RLM (Right-to-Left Mark) characters. This causes a buffer overflow when the messages are rendered and parsed, leading to a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service. The affected application (Messages) will crash when a user attempts to view the maliciously crafted message. This is due to the excessive processing of the malformed input.

**Attack vectors:** The primary attack vector involves sending a specially crafted message via the Messages application. The malicious message can be sent through various means including messaging platforms like WhatsApp.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs to be able to send a text message to the victim. No special network position or privileged access is required.

**Additional Information:**
*   The exploit relies on sending a text message containing numerous RLM (Right-to-Left Mark) characters, followed by some normal text. The RLM character is a non-printing character used in bidirectional text.
*   The excessive use of RLM characters causes a buffer overflow when processing the text, leading to a crash.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple Apple platforms and versions including macOS High Sierra 10.13.4, iOS 11.3, tvOS 11.3, and watchOS 4.3.0.
*   A proof of concept (PoC) is publicly available, which demonstrates how to construct the malicious message with a python script.
*   The vulnerability was addressed by improving message validation in the respective security updates.
