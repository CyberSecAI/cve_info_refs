*   The root cause is a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data related to these tags.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Out-of-bounds read: The insufficient validation allows a read operation to occur past the end of an allocated memory object.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Information Disclosure: An attacker can potentially disclose sensitive information due to the out-of-bounds read.
*   Remote Code Execution (in conjunction with other vulnerabilities): While this specific vulnerability is primarily for information disclosure, it can be leveraged alongside other vulnerabilities to potentially achieve code execution within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Remote: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by enticing a user to interact with malicious content.
*   User Interaction: Exploitation requires user interaction, such as visiting a malicious web page or opening a malicious file (XPS file in this instance).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious XPS file to the victim or host a malicious webpage that triggers the vulnerability when the victim uses Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.
*   A security update has been released by Adobe to address this flaw.
*  The vulnerability was reported by Ke Liu of Tencent's Xuanwu LAB.
