Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-4993:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in Microsoft's NT LAN Manager (NTLM) authentication implementation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **NTLM SSO hash theft:** The core issue is that an attacker can redirect a user to a malicious resource outside of their organization in order to obtain NTLM authentication messages. This can be achieved by exploiting how Adobe Acrobat and Reader handle NTLM authentication requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to steal the user's NTLM SSO hash, which can potentially be used for further attacks such as dictionary attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Resource Redirection:** Attackers trick users into accessing a malicious resource (e.g., a server under the attacker's control) outside the organization. This can be achieved through links embedded in a PDF document, for example.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by opening a PDF document containing malicious links.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious resource accessible to the victim.
*   The attacker needs to craft a PDF document or use other methods to redirect users to this malicious resource, which initiates the NTLM authentication process with the malicious resource.
*   The attacker is external and needs to trick the victim into opening the malicious PDF or clicking on a malicious link.

**Mitigation:**

*   **Microsoft's Optional Security Enhancement:**  Microsoft released an optional update that allows disabling NTLM SSO authentication for public resources. Applying this update on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 can mitigate the issue.
*   **Acrobat/Reader Protected View:** Enabling Protected View in Acrobat and Reader can mitigate the vulnerability, especially when opening PDFs from potentially untrusted sources or from the internet in Internet Explorer.
*   **Optional Feature Lockdown Key:**  An optional feature lockdown key was introduced, allowing administrators to suppress PDF actions that result in opening a link which prevents the redirection attack vector.

**Additional Information:**

*   A proof-of-concept code for this vulnerability was publicly available.
*   This vulnerability affects Adobe Acrobat and Reader on both Windows and macOS platforms.
*   The vulnerability was rated as "Important," indicating a significant risk.

This information provides a more detailed explanation of CVE-2018-4993 than the original description in the CVE record, particularly regarding the root cause (NTLM), the attack vector (malicious redirection), and available mitigations.
