- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in the `Dispatch` function of the Renderman install helper tool. The tool does not verify the caller, allowing any user to access the function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of caller verification, exposing the `Dispatch` function to any user and allowing arbitrary file reads due to the use of the `open` function with user-provided file paths.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read any root file from the file system, leading to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the machine is required. The attacker interacts with the vulnerable service using XPC messages, sending a specially crafted message to trigger the arbitrary file read vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Local access to the target machine, the ability to send crafted XPC messages to the vulnerable service.
