Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-4982

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a heap-based buffer overflow within the parsing of BMP images embedded inside EMF files.
- The core issue is the insufficient validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it into a fixed-size, heap-based buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:**  A buffer overflow occurs when more data is written to a memory buffer than it can hold. This overwrites adjacent memory locations, leading to unpredictable behavior or malicious code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the current user. This allows the attacker to take complete control of the affected system, potentially leading to data theft, malware installation, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely, meaning they don't need physical access to the targeted system.
- **User Interaction Required:** The attack requires user interaction, such as opening a malicious file or visiting a malicious web page. The user must interact with crafted files to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Malicious Files:** Attackers can embed the specially crafted BMP image inside an EMF file. This malicious EMF file can then be used to trigger the vulnerability in Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious file that contains a specially crafted BMP image embedded inside an EMF file.
- The attacker needs to trick the user into opening this malicious file using Adobe Acrobat Pro DC to execute the arbitrary code under the context of the current user.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of BMP images inside EMF files.
- The lack of proper data length validation allows the overflow to occur.

**Affected Products:**
- Adobe Acrobat Pro DC

**Severity:**
- Critical (as per Adobe's bulletin), CVSS score of 6.8.

**Mitigation:**
- Adobe has released a patch to address this vulnerability. Users are advised to update their software to the latest versions.
