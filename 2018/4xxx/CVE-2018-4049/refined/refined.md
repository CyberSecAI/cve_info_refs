- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect default permissions on the "Games" directory created by GOG Galaxy, granting "Full Control" to the "Everyone" group.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure file permissions that allow any user to read, write, or modify arbitrary files within the "Games" directory.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Local privilege elevation by overwriting executables of installed games, including those with privileged installer components (e.g., DirectX installer), leading to arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges.
    - Potential for lateral movement by elevating to other user accounts.
- **Attack vectors**: Local attacker with access to the system can modify files within the GOG Galaxy "Games" directory.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Local user access to the system where GOG Galaxy is installed.
