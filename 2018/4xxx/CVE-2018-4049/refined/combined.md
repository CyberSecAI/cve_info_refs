# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2018-0723

## GOG Galaxy Games directory insecure file permissions local privilege elevation vulnerability

##### March 26, 2019

##### CVE Number

CVE-2018-4049

### Summary

An exploitable local privilege elevation vulnerability exists in the file system permissions of GOG Galaxy’s “Games” directory. An attacker can overwrite executables of installed games to exploit this vulnerability and execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

### Tested Versions

Gog Galaxy 1.2.48.36 (Windows 64-bit Installer)

### Product URLs

<https://www.gog.com/galaxy>

### CVSSv3 Score

9.3 - CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions

### Details

GOG Galaxy is a platform that allows users to launch, update and manage video games. By default, GOG Galaxy installs games in a directory that allows anyone on the system to have “full control.” This allows all users to read, write or modify arbitrary files in the “Games” directory. If the installed games include a privileged installer component, such as a DirectX installer, Visual Studio redistributable, or some other run-once installer that executes with Administrator permissions, the attack can result in Administrative access. Users can also elevate to other user accounts by overwriting arbitrary executables.

```
### Mitigation

Users of GOG Galaxy can replace the “Full Control” permission with “Read and Execute” for the “Everyone” group on the GOG Galaxy “Games” directory and ensure all file system objects below that path inherit from the parent directory.
