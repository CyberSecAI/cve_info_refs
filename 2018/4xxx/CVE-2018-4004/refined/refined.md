- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in the `disconnectService` function of the Shimo VPN Helper Tool allows a non-root user to kill any process by providing its PID. The helper tool, which runs with root privileges, does not properly validate the provided PID before attempting to kill the process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Privilege escalation through improper input validation and lack of authorization check, allowing a non-root user to control the killing of any process.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can kill any process on the system, including critical system processes which could result in denial of service or system instability.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the machine.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a non-root user on the system.
