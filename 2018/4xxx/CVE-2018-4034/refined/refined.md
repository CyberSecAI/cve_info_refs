- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in the `removeItemAtPath` function of the CleanMyMac X helper tool. The function allows a user-supplied path argument to be passed to `removeFileAtPath` without proper validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Lack of validation on the input path provided to the `removeFileAtPath` function.
    - The privileged helper tool running as root is accessible to non-root applications, leading to a privilege escalation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker can delete files from the root file system, which could lead to system instability or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Local access is required for exploitation.
    - Any application can access the vulnerable function due to lack of validation on the calling application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Attacker needs to have local access to the machine where CleanMyMac X is installed.
    - The attacker does not need root privileges initially.
