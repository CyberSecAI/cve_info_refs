Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-4026:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `XML_GetScreen` function of the Novatek NT9665X chipset firmware, specifically within the processing of the HTTP request path. The function uses the return value of `strchr` call to locate the '.' character but does not validate the return value, leading to an invalid memory read in `strncmp` if the character is not found in the path.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unchecked Return Value:** The code fails to check the return value of the `strchr` function. This is a classic case of not handling potential null pointers leading to a dereference of invalid memory addresses. Specifically, it's an unchecked return value of `strchr` that, if NULL, results in a subsequent invalid read.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** Exploitation leads to a device crash and reboot due to an invalid memory access during the `strncmp` function call, effectively causing a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is reachable via network requests to the embedded web server running on the device.
- **Specifically Crafted HTTP Request:** A malicious actor can send a specially crafted HTTP request to the camera's web server that does not contain a '.' or contains only '.' or '..' characters in the path. This will trigger the vulnerability. The format of the request is `http://192.168.1.254/?custom=1&cmd=4001` with a crafted URL path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the device and be able to communicate with its web server on port 80.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be triggered without authentication because the targeted endpoint does not require authentication.
