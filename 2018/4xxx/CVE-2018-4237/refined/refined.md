  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2018-4237",
      "root_cause": "The task_set_special_port API allows callers to overwrite their bootstrap port, which is used to communicate with launchd. This port is inherited across forks: child processes will use the same bootstrap port as the parent.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Logic issue in libxpc",
          "Insecure use of task_set_special_port API"
      ],
      "impact": "An application may be able to gain elevated privileges. A MITM position can be established between a child process and launchd allowing the attacker to modify communication. In the provided exploit, this is used to target the `sudo` binary and make it appear as though the supplied password was valid.",
      "attack_vector": "A local attacker can overwrite the bootstrap port and fork a child process to gain a MitM position between the child process and launchd, then target a privileged process like sudo.",
      "required_capabilities": "Local access to the system with the ability to execute code."
