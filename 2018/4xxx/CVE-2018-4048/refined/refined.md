- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect default file system permissions for the GOG Galaxy `Temp` directory (`C:\ProgramData\GOG.com\Galaxy\temp\desktop-galaxy-updater`). The directory allows "Everyone" to have "Full Control".
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure file permissions on the temporary directory used by the GOG Galaxy updater. This allows any user on the system to modify files in the directory, including executables.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can overwrite executables used by the GOG Galaxy updater, which are later executed with SYSTEM privileges, leading to arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges. This grants the attacker full control over the affected system.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required. An attacker needs to have a user account on the target machine.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have a local user account with the ability to write to the GOG Galaxy temp directory. No special privileges are required for the initial exploit.
