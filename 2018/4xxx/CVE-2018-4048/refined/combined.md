# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2018-0722

## GOG Galaxy updater temp directory insecure file permissions local privilege elevation vulnerability

##### March 26, 2019

##### CVE Number

CVE-2018-4048

### Summary

An exploitable local privilege elevation vulnerability exists in the file system permissions of GOG Galaxy’s `Temp` directory. An attacker can overwrite executables of the Desktop Galaxy Updater to exploit this vulnerability and execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.

### Tested Versions

Gog Galaxy 1.2.48.36 (Windows 64-bit Installer)

### Product URLs

<https://www.gog.com/galaxy>

### CVSSv3 Score

9.3 - CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions

### Details

GOG Galaxy is a platform that allows users to launch, update and manage video games. By default, GOG Galaxy extracts the executables for the automatic update function in a directory that allows anyone on the system to have “full control.” This allows all users to read, write or modify arbitrary files related to the GOG Galaxy Updater Service. The executables include sensitive data, such as a root CA, as well as executables that will be run with SYSTEM privileges once they are installed, allowing an attacker to overwrite them prior to installation to achieve arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges.
