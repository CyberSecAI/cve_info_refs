# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2018-0728

## Pixar Renderman install helper privilege escalation vulnerability

##### January 14, 2019

##### CVE Number

CVE-2018-4054

### Summary

A local privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the install helper tool of the Mac OS X version of Pixar Renderman, version 22.2.0. A user with local access can use this vulnerability to escalate their privileges to root. An attacker would need local access to the machine to successfully exploit this flaw.

### Tested Versions

Renderman 22.2.0 for Mac OS X

### Product URLs

<https://renderman.pixar.com>

### CVSSv3 Score

9.0 - CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N

### CWE

CWE-19: Improper Input Validation

### Details

Renderman is a rendering application used in animation and film production. It is widely used for advanced rendering and shading in many large-scale environments. When installing the Mac OS X version of the application, a helper tool is installed and launched as root. This service continues to listen even after completing installation. The vulnerability lies in the lack of verification in the `Dispatch` function. The caller of this function is not checked, and the function is exposed to any user. The relevant code is shown below.

```
case 0x101D3:                                                  [0]
      v11 = xpc_dictionary_create_reply(a1[1]);
      v12 = a1[1];
      v13 = xpc_dictionary_get_value();
      length = xpc_array_get_count(v13, "argv");               [1]
      if ( (signed int)length > 0 )

        //COPY LOOP

        while ( argc < length );                                [2]

        v15 = Launch(argv, argc);                               [3]

```

The first part of the function, [0], gets the message ID and passes it through a switch statement. If the case is the one shown, this code block is entered. At location [1], the count of the XPC array `argv` is determined. There is an extensive copy loop, [2], that copies from the XPC array to an internal memory structure. This structure is then passed in to `Launch` at location [3]. This allows any application to pass in an XPC array named `argv`, and the application will launch a binary with the contents of said array. This helper runs as root so this crosses a privilege boundary, allowing an attacker to run code with elevated privileges.

### Exploit Proof of Concept

Included with this advisory is a C source file, as well as a Python script. The Python script needs to be made executable and put into `/tmp/root.py`. The command `nc -l 1337` needs to be executed in a separate window to accept the root shell.

### Timeline

2018-11-28 - Vendor disclosure

2018-12-11 - Vendor patched

2019-01-14 - Public release
