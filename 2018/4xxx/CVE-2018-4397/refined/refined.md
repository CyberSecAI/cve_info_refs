- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Analytics data was being sent over HTTP instead of HTTPS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure communication protocol. Data sent over HTTP is unencrypted and susceptible to interception.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker in a privileged network position could intercept analytics data sent to Apple.
- **Attack vectors:** Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a privileged network position, meaning they can intercept network traffic between the affected device and Apple's servers.
