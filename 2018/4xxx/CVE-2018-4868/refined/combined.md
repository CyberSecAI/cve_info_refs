### @D4N **[D4N](/D4N)** commented [Jan 9, 2018](#issue-287225766)

When parsing a subBox that is a ColorHeader, a length is extracted from the input file and fed directly into DataBuf() (which calls malloc). A crafted input file can provide arbitrarily (up to max(uint32\_t)-8) large values and result in excessive memory allocation.

This PR adds a check for the new size of DataBuf so that it is not larger than the remaining size of the file. The reproducer is also added to the test suite.

This fixes [#202](https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/issues/202) aka [CVE-2018-4868](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8x93-7gj9-73c3 "CVE-2018-4868").

This looks good to me, Dan. I've "updated the branch" and when it passes appveyor/travis I will merge this to master. Thanks for working on this.

| Please do not use the update branch button, it results in an extremely messy history when a PR exits for a longer time (especially if you press the button multiple times). It is harder to cherry-pick commits in a non-linear history and is a burden for package maintainers who have to backport patches.  The contribution guide mentions that we should instead rebase the changes on top of master before merging them, that way the commit history stays linear. I have just done that & we can merge this once travis is green again. |

| So many hidden rules in GitHub. Well they might be in a documentation, however I can't understand the documentation! We'll get there with many things. You'll see.  Incidentally, I will do everything that I can to avoid changing test/data/bugfixes-test.out and going to run `$ cd tests ; python3 runner.py` from test/Makefile. I don't think we need to rewrite test/bugfixes-test.out at the moment. For new tests, I'll try to add them to the "new" test harness. If I'm unable to do that, I'll add a simple bash script for the moment on a case-by-case basis. For sure, I don't know how to test [#223](https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/pull/223) using the new test harness and that's what I'd like to discuss with you 1-to-1. |

| I think we really shouldn't be pulling in data over the internet during tests, as that makes the tests depend on a functioning internet connection or silently fail. Imho we should consider Luis' suggestion from a few weeks ago to create a new repository for testfiles for exiv2 that manages them via git lfs. You'll essentially get the same, the files are stored on a webserver and do not blow up the repo size, but it all still looks like git. We could then embed that repository via a git submodule. Concerning your actual problem, this will involve some additional work, as the test suite was not intended to download files. Could you take a look at tests/doc.md? That should cover everything that the test suite can do. This would be especially helpful for me, as I could find out where the documentation is lacking & improve it. I'll take a look how to pull in the test files, shouldn't be that hard with Python's urllib.

| Thanks, Dan. I used svn to store test files for video and eps. Git? Sure, why not. Because of my lack of skill with git, you'll understand why I haven't adopted that solution in this script.  However both the "new" test harness and my efforts here use the concept of storing the "reference output" in the script and not in an external monolith such as test/data/bugfixes-test.out.  The puzzle isn't how to get the file (with curl/svn/git/urllib), the puzzle is that I haven't discovered how to run the test on multiple files and how to represent the "reference output". For me, another important object is to be able to run a single script (rather than a collection such as test/bugfixes-text.sh).  So, we are in strong agreement about the direction and I'm asking for a little assistance to get onto our agreed/chosen road. |

I'll put this on my todo list.  However both the "new" test harness and my efforts here use the concept of storing the "reference output" in the script and not in an external monolith such as test/data/bugfixes-test.out. The puzzle isn't how to get the file (with curl/svn/git/urllib), the puzzle is that I haven't discovered how to run the test on multiple files and how to represent the "reference output". For me, another important object is to be able to run a single script (rather than a collection such as test/bugfixes-text.sh).  Take a look at tests/bugfixes/github/test\_issue\_20.py To run exiv2 multiple times, you just have provide the test suite with a list of commands to run (and of course a list of stdout, stderr and return values). To download your files, you have to write a custom setUp() function (that is the standard pre-test function in python's unittest framework) and a tearDown() that will delete them again. But this might be a little tricky for the start, so we can discuss that on slack. â¦  So, we are in strong agreement about the direction and I'm asking for a little assistance to get onto our agreed/chosen road. -- You are receiving this because you modified the open/close state.

| Thanks for those pointers.  It's a dry cold frosty sunny morning (1â) in England so I'm going out to run and will investigate your suggestions after lunch. I don't want to delete downloaded test images as they will never change. It's the script (and reference output) that may change and will be checked in with the code.  I hope things are good with you at work. Thank You for all the effort you are putting into Exiv2. |
