- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in the `pleaseTerminate` function of the Clean My Mac X helper service. The function does not validate the calling application, allowing any application to invoke it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of input validation, privilege escalation by allowing non-root users to terminate a root daemon.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker can terminate a privileged helper application, which could disrupt the normal functioning of the Clean My Mac X software. This is a denial-of-service vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the machine is required. An attacker can use a malicious application to invoke the `pleaseTerminate` function of the helper service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Local access to the machine. The attacker does not need root privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
