WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• To exploit CVE-2018-4842, the attacker needs to be able to log into the administrative web applica-

tion.

• To exploit CVE-2018-4848 the attacker must trick the user to click on a link while being logged in.

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SCALANCE X switches are used to connect industrial components like Programmable Logic Controllers
(PLCs) or Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs).

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-4842

A remote, authenticated attacker with access to the conﬁguration web server could be able to store
script code on the web site, if the HRP redundancy option is set. This code could be executed in the
web browser of victims visiting this web site (XSS), affecting its conﬁdentiality, integrity and availability.

User interaction is required for successful exploitation, as the user needs to visit the manipulated web
site. At the stage of publishing this security advisory no public exploitation is known. The vendor has
conﬁrmed the vulnerability and provides mitigations to resolve it.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-4848

The integrated conﬁguration web server of the affected devices could allow Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
attacks if unsuspecting users are tricked into accessing a malicious link.

User interaction is required for a successful exploitation. The user must be logged into the web
interface in order for the exploitation to succeed. At the stage of publishing this security advisory no
public exploitation is known. The vendor has conﬁrmed the vulnerability and provides mitigations to
resolve it.
