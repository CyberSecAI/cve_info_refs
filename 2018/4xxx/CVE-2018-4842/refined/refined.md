- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation. Specifically, the web server allows storage of script code if the HRP redundancy option is set.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can store script code on the web site, which can then be executed in the web browser of users visiting the site, potentially affecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote, authenticated attacker with access to the configuration web server can inject malicious scripts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated and have access to the web configuration interface. Additionally, the HRP redundancy option needs to be set. User interaction is required, as the user needs to visit the manipulated website for the exploit to execute.
