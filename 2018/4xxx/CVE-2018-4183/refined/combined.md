Package        : cups
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-15400 CVE-2018-4180 CVE-2018-4181 CVE-2018-4182
                 CVE-2018-4183 CVE-2018-6553

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in CUPS, the Common UNIX Printing
System. These issues have been identified with the following CVE ids:

CVE-2017-15400

    Rory McNamara discovered that an attacker is able to execute arbitrary
    commands (with the privilege of the CUPS daemon) by setting a
    malicious IPP server with a crafted PPD file.

CVE-2018-4180

     Dan Bastone of Gotham Digital Science discovered that a local
     attacker with access to cupsctl could escalate privileges by setting
     an environment variable.

CVE-2018-4181

     Eric Rafaloff and John Dunlap of Gotham Digital Science discovered
     that a local attacker can perform limited reads of arbitrary files
     as root by manipulating cupsd.conf.

CVE-2018-4182

    Dan Bastone of Gotham Digital Science discovered that an attacker
    with sandboxed root access can execute backends without a sandbox
    profile by provoking an error in CUPS' profile creation.

CVE-2018-4183

     Dan Bastone and Eric Rafaloff of Gotham Digital Science discovered
     that an attacker with sandboxed root access can execute arbitrary
     commands as unsandboxed root by modifying /etc/cups/cups-files.conf

CVE-2018-6553

    Dan Bastone of Gotham Digital Science discovered that an attacker
    can bypass the AppArmor cupsd sandbox by invoking the dnssd backend
    using an alternate name that has been hard linked to dnssd.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.1-8+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your cups packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1607284#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2018-07-23 08:09:53 UTC  ```  The sandbox profile dynamically generated by cupsdCreateProfile() unintentionally allows write access to /etc/cups.  This can be used by an attacker that has obtained sandboxed root access to alter /etc/cups/cups-files.conf, leading to unsandboxed root code execution.  References:  <https://blog.gdssecurity.com/labs/2018/7/11/cups-local-privilege-escalation-and-sandbox-escapes.html>  Upstream patch:  <https://github.com/apple/cups/commit/d47f6aec436e0e9df6554436e391471097686ecc>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1607284#c1)  Andrej Nemec    2018-07-23 08:31:20 UTC  ``` Created cups tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1607293](show_bug.cgi?id=1607293 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-4180 CVE-2018-4181 CVE-2018-4182 CVE-2018-4183 cups: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1607284#c3)  Riccardo Schirone    2018-07-25 09:21:18 UTC  ``` Fedora and RHEL are not affected by this flaw since Sandbox feature is not enabled on Linux.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1607284#c4)  Riccardo Schirone    2018-08-28 13:00:29 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of cups as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux as cups on Linux does not support the Sandbox feature.   ``` |  |
