Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2018-4398:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
An issue existed in the method for determining prime numbers within the CoreCrypto component.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
A weakness in the Miller-Rabin primality test could be exploited.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could exploit the weakness to incorrectly identify prime numbers. This could potentially compromise cryptographic operations relying on prime numbers.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is present in the CoreCrypto component and could potentially be exploited in any context where this component is used to generate or verify prime numbers.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker would need to be able to influence the prime number generation/verification process that utilizes the vulnerable Miller-Rabin primality test. Specific capabilities depend on the targeted application using CoreCrypto.

**Affected Products:**
The following products are listed as affected by this vulnerability:
- watchOS 5.1 (Apple Watch Series 1 and later)
- macOS Sierra 10.12.6, macOS High Sierra 10.13.6, macOS Mojave 10.14
- tvOS 12.1 (Apple TV 4K and Apple TV 4th generation)
- iTunes 12.9.1 for Windows (Windows 7 and later)
- iCloud for Windows 7.8 (Windows 7 and later)
- iOS 12.1 (iPhone 5s and later, iPad Air and later, and iPod touch 6th generation)

**Mitigation:**
The issue was addressed by using pseudorandom bases for testing of primes instead of the vulnerable method.
