- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The HTTP server on the Novatek NT9665X chipset, used in devices like the Anker Roav A1 Dashcam, allows overwriting the root directory with a file due to improper handling of HTTP POST requests.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: 
    - Incorrect Default Permissions: The web server lacks proper input validation or access controls, allowing unauthenticated users to overwrite critical system directories.
    -  The web server running on port 80 requires no authentication.

- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Denial of service: Overwriting the root directory renders the web server inoperable.
    - Data loss: The device reformats the SD card on reboot, deleting all previous recordings and snapshots because it cannot find expected directories.
    - Device Disablement: When paired with other vulnerabilities, can lead to total device disablement until the battery runs out.

- **Attack vectors**: Sending an HTTP POST request to the root URL (e.g., `curl -x POST http://192.168.1.254//`).

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker must be on the same network as the device's Wi-Fi access point.
    - The attacker needs to know the device's IP address.
    - The attacker does not need authentication to interact with the webserver.
