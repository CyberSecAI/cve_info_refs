Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-4020:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `system_advanced_misc.php` script in Netgate pfSense CE. Specifically, the `powerd_ac_mode` POST parameter is not sanitized before being used in a system command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is OS command injection (CWE-78). The `powerd_ac_mode` POST parameter is directly inserted into a shell command executed by the `mwexec()` function without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system with the privileges of the web server user.
- **System Compromise:** This could lead to full system compromise, data theft, denial of service, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/system_advanced_misc.php` endpoint.
- **`powerd_ac_mode` Parameter:** The malicious payload is injected through the `powerd_ac_mode` POST parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be able to send authenticated POST requests to the pfSense administration web interface. This means they need valid credentials or a means to bypass authentication.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the pfSense web administration interface.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability exists because the code takes the value of the POST parameter `powerd_ac_mode`, stores it in `$config['system']['powerd_ac_mode']` and then later uses this value in the `$ac_mode` variable. This variable is then incorporated into a command executed by `mwexec`.
- The `activate_powerd()` function retrieves the value from the configuration and uses it to form the command.
- The `mwexec()` function is a wrapper for the `exec()` function which executes the given command.
- The vulnerability is part of a set of three command injection vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-4019, CVE-2018-4020, CVE-2018-4021) within the same script, affecting different parameters related to power management.
