The content is related to CVE-2018-4073.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `Embedded_Ace_TLSet_Task.cgi` endpoint of the ACEManager web server in Sierra Wireless AirLink ES450 devices. This endpoint allows modification of table values using MSCIIDs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect Permission Assignment:** The `Embedded_Ace_TLSet_Task.cgi` binary has overly permissive file permissions (`-rwxr-xr-x`), allowing execution by any user, including low-privilege users.
- **Unrestricted Configuration Changes:** The endpoint does not restrict the configuration settings that can be modified via MSCIIDs, allowing arbitrary system setting changes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:
- Change user passwords.
- Enable or disable services.
- Modify any configuration setting on the device.
- Execute the vulnerable binary via the web interface or SSH.

**Attack vectors:**
- By sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/Embedded_Ace_TLSet_Task.cgi` endpoint.
- By executing the binary directly through SSH as any user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the AirLink ES450 device.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the target MSCIIDs and values to be modified.
