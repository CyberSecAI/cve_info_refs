Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-4095:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the `bluetoothd` daemon handles session tokens.  Instead of using a secure, randomized session token, it uses the actual mach port used for communication as the session token. This is of type `mach_port_t`.  Since mach ports have a known structure, they are easily brute-forced.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure Session Token Handling:** Using the mach port itself as a session token allows for easy prediction and brute-forcing by malicious apps.
- **Lack of proper authorization:** bluetoothd fails to adequately verify the legitimacy of a client using this session token, leading to the ability to impersonate or "hijack" sessions with other clients of `bluetoothd`.
- **Callback injection:** successful exploitation allows an attacker to register arbitrary callbacks within legitimate client processes of `bluetoothd`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution with System Privileges:** According to the Apple security advisory, successful exploitation allows an application to execute arbitrary code with system privileges.
- **Sandbox Escape:** A sandboxed application can add callbacks to other processes with different sandbox contexts, achieving a sandbox escape.
- **Mach Port Leaks:**  Exploitation can be used to leak mach ports of various bluetoothd clients, expanding the attack surface of those clients.
- **Control over bluetoothd clients:** Attackers can inject code into various processes including SpringBoard, mDNSResponder, and others, which are crucial components of the OS.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Hijacked sessions can cause crashes and instability in various system components. The example provided shows a thread crash in `wifid`.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Mach message manipulation:** The attack utilizes mach message communication with the bluetoothd daemon.
- **Brute-force:** A malicious application needs to brute-force the mach port struct, which is used as the session token.
- **Callback registration:** Once the session is hijacked, malicious code can register new callbacks on the victim client.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Sandboxed Application:** The attacker needs to have a malicious application running in a sandboxed context on the affected device.
- **Mach Port:** The attacker needs a valid mach port to the `bluetoothd` service to communicate with it. This can be obtained through `launchd`.
- **Brute-force Capability:** The attacker needs to be capable of brute-forcing the session token which is a `mach_port_t` struct.
