Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2018-4182:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
An access issue within the CUPS (Common Unix Printing System) framework.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
A sandboxed process is able to circumvent sandbox restrictions due to insufficient access restrictions within CUPS. Specifically, a sandboxed process with root access could execute backends without a sandbox profile by provoking an error in CUPS' profile creation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A sandboxed process can bypass sandbox restrictions, potentially allowing for further compromise of the system. An attacker with sandboxed root access can execute arbitrary commands as unsandboxed root

**Attack vectors:**
A local attacker with a sandboxed process that has root access is required. The attacker needs to provoke an error in CUPS' profile creation to execute backends without a sandbox profile.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must have local access to the system and be able to run a sandboxed process with root privileges. They also need to be able to manipulate CUPS in a way that provokes an error in profile creation.
