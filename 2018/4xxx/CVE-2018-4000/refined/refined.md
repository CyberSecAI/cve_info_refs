- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the way Atlantis Word Processor parses Office Open XML documents, specifically when handling table rows (`TTableRow` objects). A malformed document can cause a single `TTableRow` instance to be referenced twice due to an incorrect assumption about the order of XML tag processing and scoping. When the parser encounters a specific sequence of table row (`tr`) and row properties (`rPr`) elements, the same `TTableRow` object can be associated with multiple nested elements. When the parser then attempts to free the allocated objects as the elements go out of scope, the same memory block of the `TTableRow` object will be freed twice, causing a double-free condition.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Double-free vulnerability (CWE-415). The application frees the same memory block twice.

- **Impact of exploitation**: Heap corruption can occur, which can be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution in the context of the application.

- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to convince the victim to open a specially crafted document (docx) using the vulnerable version of Atlantis Word Processor.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create a malicious document that exploits the double-free condition within the Atlantis Word Processor and must convince the victim to open the document.
