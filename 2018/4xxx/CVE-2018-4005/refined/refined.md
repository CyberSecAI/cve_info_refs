**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `configureRoutingWithCommand:withReply:` function in the Shimo VPN helper tool executes a user-supplied string as a bash script in root context without proper input validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper Input Validation (CWE-19): The function does not validate the input string before using it to create a bash script.
- Privilege Escalation: A non-privileged user can execute arbitrary code as root.
- Code Injection: The user can inject malicious commands into the bash script.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Full control of the system: An attacker can gain root privileges and perform arbitrary actions, including installing malware, stealing data, or causing denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access: An attacker needs local access to the machine to exploit this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is reachable through Objective-C XPC calls to the helper service.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- A local user on the system with the ability to make XPC calls to the Shimo VPN helper service.
- Ability to send an arbitrary string as input to the `configureRoutingWithCommand:withReply:` function.
