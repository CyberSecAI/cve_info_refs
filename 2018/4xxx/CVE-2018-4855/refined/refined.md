- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Unencrypted storage of passwords in client configuration files and during network transmission.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Passwords are not encrypted, making them vulnerable to interception.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can obtain access passwords for the affected devices.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to be in a privileged network position to intercept communication between the device and the administrative client. The user must also initiate a session between the administrative client and the device for the vulnerability to be exploited.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have a privileged position in the network to eavesdrop on traffic between the device and client. The attacker does not require prior authentication. User interaction is required for an attack.
