SUMMARY

SICLOCK TC devices are affected by multiple vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to cause
Denial-of-Service conditions, bypass the authentication, and modify the ﬁrmware of the device or the
administrative client.

SICLOCK TC devices are in a phase out process. Siemens recommends mitigations to reduce the risk.

and Mitigations

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Provide redundant time sources and implement plausibility checks for the time information in critical

plant controllers.

• Protect network access to the affected devices with appropriate measures, e.g. protect SICLOCK

TC devices with ﬁrewalls to reduce the risk.

It is recommended to ﬁlter trafﬁc to all ports excluding those needed for time synchronization. If
time synchronization is performed using NTP, then port 123/udp must be opened on the ﬁrewall. If
time synchronization is performed using SIMATIC time synchronization, then port 22223/udp and
port 22224/udp must be opened on the ﬁrewall.

For conﬁguring parameters, it is recommended to use a direct connection to the SICLOCK TC.

• Apply the cell protection concept, and apply defense-in-depth: https://www.siemens.com/cert/

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SICLOCK product family offers components for synchronizing the time in industrial plants and
systems. The SICLOCK central plant clocks evaluate the clock time information received from the radio
receiver and supply all connected network nodes with precise and uniform time information.

In the event of failure or loss of reception from the primary time source, the central plant clock ensures
stable continuation of the clock time, and tracking of the system time without time jumps as soon as
reception is restored. Available products are the SICLOCK TC100 for smaller plants and the SICLOCK
TC400.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.0
(CVSS v3.0) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-4851

An attacker with network access to the device, could cause a Denial-of-Service condition by sending
certain packets to the device, causing potential reboots of the device. The core functionality of the
device could be impacted. The time serving functionality recovers when time synchronization with
GPS devices or other NTP servers are completed.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to the affected devices.
Successful exploitation requires no user interaction. The vulnerability could impact the availablity of
the device, and could impact the integrity of the time service functionality of the device.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-4852

An attacker with network access to the device could potentially circumvent the authentication mecha-
nism, if he is able to obtain certain knowledge speciﬁc to the attacked device.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to the affected devices.
Furthermore, the attacker must obtain certain knowledge that is speciﬁc to the device. Successful
exploitation requires no user interaction. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to read and modify
the device conﬁguration.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-4853

An attacker with network access to port 69/udp could modify the ﬁrmware of the device.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to the affected devices.
Successful exploitation requires no user interaction. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to run
his own code on the device.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-4854

An attacker with network access to port 69/udp could modify the administrative client stored on the
device. If a legitimate user downloads and executes the modiﬁed client from the affected device, then
he could obtain code execution on the client system.

The security vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker with network access to the device. User
interaction is required in order for the attack to compromise the client system.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-4855

Unencrypted storage of passwords in the client conﬁguration ﬁles and during network transmission
could allow an attacker in a privileged position to obtain access passwords.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker in a privileged network position which
allows intercepting the communication between the affected device and the administrative client. The
user must invoke a session between the administrative client and the device. The vulnerability could
allow reading the access passwords for the devices.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.

An attacker with administrative access to the device’s management interface could lock out legitimate
users. Manual interaction is required to restore the access of legitimate users.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to the affected devices.
Furthermore, the attacker must be authenticated to the management interface before executing the
attack. Successful exploitation requires no user interaction.
