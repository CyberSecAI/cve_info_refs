- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The coTURN server, by default, runs an unauthenticated telnet admin portal on the loopback interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated telnet admin portal, hardcoded default configuration.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who gains access to the telnet port can obtain administrator access to the TURN server configuration, potentially leading to further attacks like bypassing firewalls.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access to the telnet port on the loopback interface of the server running coTURN.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the telnet port (usually on localhost) or have a foothold on the server itself. This may include gaining access to the server or using a man-in-the-middle position if the telnet port is exposed outside the loopback interface.
