{
  "CVE-2018-4069": {
    "Description": "The ACEManager authentication functionality is delivered in plaintext XML to the web server. An attacker can listen to network traffic upstream from the device, which may allow access to credentials.",
    "Root cause": "The ACEManager authentication process transmits credentials in plaintext XML format.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data (CWE-311)"
    ],
    "Impact": "Exposure of user credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the device.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network sniffing/monitoring. An attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the client and server.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be in a position to eavesdrop on network traffic. They do not need prior authentication."
