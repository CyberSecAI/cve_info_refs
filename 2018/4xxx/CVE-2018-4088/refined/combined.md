# USN-3551-1: WebKitGTK+ vulnerabilities

30 January 2018

Several security issues were fixed in WebKitGTK+.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [webkit2gtk](/security/cves?package=webkit2gtk) - Web content engine library for GTK+

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in the WebKitGTK+ Web and

JavaScript engines. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially

crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a

denial of service, spoof the user interface, or execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-4088](/security/CVE-2018-4088), [CVE-2018-4096](/security/CVE-2018-4096), [CVE-2017-7153](/security/CVE-2017-7153), [CVE-2017-7160](/security/CVE-2017-7160),

[CVE-2017-7161](/security/CVE-2017-7161), [CVE-2017-7165](/security/CVE-2017-7165), [CVE-2017-13884](/security/CVE-2017-13884), [CVE-2017-13885](/security/CVE-2017-13885))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 17.10

* [libjavascriptcoregtk-4.0-18](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit2gtk)
  -
  [2.18.6-0ubuntu0.17.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit2gtk/2.18.6-0ubuntu0.17.10.1)
* [libwebkit2gtk-4.0-37](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit2gtk)
  -
  [2.18.6-0ubuntu0.17.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit2gtk/2.18.6-0ubuntu0.17.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [libjavascriptcoregtk-4.0-18](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit2gtk)
  -
  [2.18.6-0ubuntu0.16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit2gtk/2.18.6-0ubuntu0.16.04.1)
* [libwebkit2gtk-4.0-37](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit2gtk)
  -
  [2.18.6-0ubuntu0.16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit2gtk/2.18.6-0ubuntu0.16.04.1)

This update uses a new upstream release, which includes additional bug

fixes. After a standard system update you need to restart any applications

that use WebKitGTK+, such as Epiphany, to make all the necessary changes.
