   ```
   muxread,anmf: fail on multiple image chunks

   treat an ANMF chunk containing multiple VP8/VP8L file as malformed.
   fixes a WebPMuxImage::img_ leak.

   Though the invalid free in #9106 was avoided in (ubsan):
   be738c6d muxread,ChunkVerifyAndAssign: validate chunk_size
   that file would still cause a leak similar to #9099.

   fix alpha-filtering crash when image width is larger than radius

   (we also limit radius based on height too, for good measure, although it's not an asan bug)

   fixes oss-fuzz issue #9105
