Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-25014:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of an uninitialized value within the `ReadSymbol()` function in the libwebp library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use of Uninitialized Variable:** The core issue is that a variable within the `ReadSymbol()` function is used before being assigned a valid value. This leads to undefined behavior, potentially causing unexpected results and security vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Confidentiality and Integrity:** The use of an uninitialized value can lead to corrupted data being processed.
- **System Availability:** The undefined behavior can result in crashes or unpredictable application behavior, impacting system availability.
- **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated in the provided text, the use of an uninitialized value can potentially be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution in certain cases, depending on how the uninitialized value is used.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the processing of a specially crafted WebP image. The uninitialized value is triggered when reading the symbol table within the image.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted WebP image to a vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs to be in a position where their crafted image can be processed by a system using a vulnerable version of `libwebp`. This could be through an application that uses the library to display images or any other functionality that uses libwebp to decode the image.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in libwebp version 1.0.1.
- Red Hat has released security advisories to address this issue in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8.
- The upstream patch can be found in the chromium git repository
- The vulnerability was reported via oss-fuzz
