The provided content relates to CVE-2018-25052.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of session IDs before they are used in error messages. Specifically, the application was vulnerable to self-XSS by allowing a user to set a session ID containing malicious HTML, such as `<script><svg/onload='alert("xss")'>`. This malicious input would then be included in an error message logged by the application and could be executed within a user's browser if they accessed the log.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application was vulnerable to XSS via a crafted session ID.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Self-XSS: An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the error log, which would then be executed in the user's browser when viewing the log or error message containing the session ID. This could lead to the attacker potentially taking actions on the user's behalf or stealing session information.

**Attack vectors:**
- Setting a malicious session ID: An attacker could attempt to set a session ID that contains malicious HTML entities.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to set a session ID through some interface, such as HTTP request parameters or other means provided by the application.
