The provided content is related to CVE-2018-25045.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability was caused by a combination of factors:
1. The `urlize_quoted_links` template filter in Django REST Framework (DRF) was not correctly handling the `autoescape` context. It was not marking the output as safe, and therefore, when autoescaping was enabled, it would double-escape HTML.
2. To work around the double-escaping issue, autoescaping was disabled in the default DRF browsable API templates (`base.html`).
3. A previous fix (in PR #6191) made the `urlize_quoted_links` filter respect the autoescape context, but since autoescaping was disabled in the templates, this resulted in HTML not being escaped at all, leading to an XSS vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability: HTML content in API responses was not being properly escaped in the browsable API templates due to the disabled autoescaping, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into API responses that would be executed in the victim's browser when they visit the browsable API, allowing for session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker would need to control some data that is included in an API response and is displayed by the browsable API.
- The injected malicious script would be executed when a user visits the API using DRF's browsable API interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to insert malicious HTML/JavaScript code into data that is rendered by the browsable API.
- No special privileges are required; the attacker simply needs to inject the malicious payload through an API endpoint.
- An attacker does not necessarily need to be authenticated, as this vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious HTML into publicly accessible data.

**Additional details:**
- The fix involved re-enabling autoescaping in the default DRF browsable API template (`base.html`).
- The `urlize_quoted_links` filter was fixed to correctly mark the final string as safe and remove the unnecessary escaping logic, ensuring correct behavior with or without autoescaping.
- New test cases were added to verify that HTML is correctly escaped in the browsable API views.
- This vulnerability was fixed in DRF version 3.9.1.
