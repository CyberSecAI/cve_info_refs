Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `actix-web` crate before version 0.7.15 had multiple memory safety issues due to unsound uses of `unsafe` code, specifically:
*   Unsoundly coercing immutable references to mutable references.
*   Unsoundly extending lifetimes of strings.
*   Adding the `Send` marker trait to objects that cannot be safely sent between threads.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Memory corruption due to the incorrect use of `unsafe` leading to out-of-bounds writes and potential use-after-free conditions.
*   Incorrectly treating objects as thread-safe when they are not.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Memory corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   Use-after-free conditions.
*   Denial of service due to crashes or unexpected behavior.
*   Possible data breaches due to memory corruption.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Network-based attacks are possible given the nature of a web server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   No special privileges or user interaction is required.
*   Attack complexity is low.
*   An attacker can exploit this remotely, through network interactions.

**Additional details:**
* The vulnerability is associated with `RUSTSEC-2018-0019`, and was resolved in `actix-web` version 0.7.15.
* CVSS score of 9.8, indicating critical severity.
* The issue was tracked under [actix/actix-web#289](https://github.com/actix/actix-web/issues/289).
* The vulnerability has the CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) weakness associated with it.
