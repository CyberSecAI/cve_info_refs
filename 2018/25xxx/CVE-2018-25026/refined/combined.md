# Multiple memory safety issues
Affected versions contain multiple memory safety issues, such as:
- Unsoundly coercing immutable references to mutable references
- Unsoundly extending lifetimes of strings
- Adding the `Send` marker trait to objects that cannot be safely sent between threads
This may result in a variety of memory corruption scenarios, most likely use-after-free.
A significant refactoring effort has been conducted to resolve these issues.

## Description

[![@axon-q](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39885497?u=5a4efc25768997abecce6a039e562b6e2466271e&v=4&size=48)](/axon-q)[axon-q](https://github.com/axon-q)opened [on Jun 8, 2018](https://github.com/actix/actix-web/issues/289#issue-330605838)

Right now the actix-web code contains 100+ uses of [unsafe](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/unsafety.html). Presumably this is in order to achieve the best possible performance in hot parts of the code.

However, web servers often face the public Internet, so security is extremely important for web server implementations. This issue is especially critical for organizations that intend to use the software in large-scale production environments. One of the main reasons to choose a Rust-based HTTP implementation is the guaranteed memory safety that safe Rust provides. Unfortunately this guarantee is eroded for every use of `unsafe` in the codebase. Performance isn't worth much if it comes at the cost of critical security vulnerabilities due to unsafe memory access. It's also nice to know for certain that your web server won't segfault in production.

I propose that we leave this open as a tracking issue to track design and implementation issues concerning the use of unsafe code. Some of the items that should be explored:

* Is it possible to remove any of the current uses of `unsafe` without significantly impacting performance?
* Is it appropriate to remove some uses of `unsafe` even if there's a performance impact?
* Is there a long-term plan to reduce or eliminate the use of unsafe code?
* Security analysis, testing, and fuzzing of the codebase
* Profiling and performance analysis to assess the impact of converting unsafe to safe code

### Description

Affected versions contain multiple memory safety issues, such as:

* Unsoundly coercing immutable references to mutable references
* Unsoundly extending lifetimes of strings
* Adding the `Send` marker trait to objects that cannot be safely sent between threads

This may result in a variety of memory corruption scenarios, most likely use-after-free.

A significant refactoring effort has been conducted to resolve these issues.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
