Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The commit message "fixed a possible SQL injection" and the code diff indicate that the vulnerability was due to unsanitized input in the `fetch` parameter in the `proxy.php` file. The original code directly used `$_GET['fetch']` without proper sanitization.

**Weakness:** The code used user-supplied input directly in a way that could influence SQL queries.

**Impact:** An attacker could potentially inject malicious SQL code to perform unauthorized database operations (e.g., reading sensitive data, modifying data, or even deleting the whole database).

**Attack Vector:** The attack vector is through the `fetch` parameter in the `GET` request to `proxy.php`.

**Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `proxy.php` endpoint and modify the `fetch` parameter.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable line was `$addr = $_GET['fetch'];`
- This was fixed by replacing it with `$addr = secureGETstr('fetch');` which suggests a sanitization function `secureGETstr` is implemented.
