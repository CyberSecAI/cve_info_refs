The provided content relates to CVE-2018-25058.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `target="_blank"` attribute in HTML links without the corresponding `rel="noopener"` attribute. When a link opens in a new tab or window using `target="_blank"`, the new page gains access to the `window.opener` property of the original page. This allows the new page to potentially manipulate the original page via JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary vulnerability is the missing `rel="noopener"` attribute on links using `target="_blank"`. This allows a newly opened tab to access the original page's `window.opener` object and potentially execute malicious JavaScript on the original page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A malicious website loaded in a new tab could use the `window.opener` object to redirect the original page to a phishing site, steal user data, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A user clicks a link in the Twitter-Post-Fetcher which opens a new tab using `target="_blank"`.
- A malicious website is loaded in the new tab.
- The malicious website uses the `window.opener` object to manipulate the original page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to control the content of the new page that is opened via the link with `target="_blank"`. This could happen if the link points to an attacker-controlled website or the attacker compromises a legitimate page linked by the application.
- The attacker needs to be able to embed malicious JavaScript into the controlled page to exploit the `window.opener` object.
