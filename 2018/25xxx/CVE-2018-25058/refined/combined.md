### @lah7 **[lah7](/lah7)** commented [Mar 29, 2018](#issue-309713268)

Adds the `rel=noopener` attribute to links that open in a new tab to prevent a vulnerability where the target page could modify the parent (the page where Twitter-Post-Fetcher is embedded)

This website has a good demonstration of the issue:

<https://mathiasbynens.github.io/rel-noopener/>

(Great work by the way!) üëç

Sorry, something went wrong.
