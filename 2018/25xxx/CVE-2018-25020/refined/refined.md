  "vulnerability": {
    "cve": "CVE-2018-25020",
    "description": "Multiple NetApp products incorporate Linux Kernel. Linux Kernel versions prior to 4.17 are susceptible to a vulnerability which when successfully exploited could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "root_cause": "The root cause of this vulnerability is due to a truncation issue in the Linux Kernel's BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) implementation when adjusting branch targets after heavy instruction expansions and hardening. Specifically, when rewriting instructions, the target offset could not fit into insn->off's upper 0x7fff limit anymore, leading to an offset wrap.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
       "Improper bounds check during instruction rewriting"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "attack_vector": "Local access is needed, and the attacker needs to craft a BPF program that includes a long jump over an instruction sequence, which causes heavy expansion into multiple BPF instructions. BPF hardening needs to be enabled which leads to further rewriting of constant values.",
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need local access and the capability to influence BPF program creation and execution. The attacker also needs to enable BPF hardening."

    "NetApp Cloud Backup (formerly AltaVault)",

   "NetApp Cloud Backup (formerly AltaVault) has no plans to address this vulnerability.",
