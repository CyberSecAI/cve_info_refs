- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application used a regular expression that was vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: ReDoS vulnerability in the regular expression used to parse RGB(A) color values.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could cause a denial of service by providing a specially crafted input string that causes the regular expression engine to consume excessive CPU time.
- **Attack vectors**: By providing a malicious RGB(A) color string as input to the rgb2hex function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the rgb2hex function.
