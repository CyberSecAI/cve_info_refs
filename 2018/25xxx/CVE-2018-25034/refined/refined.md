The provided content describes multiple stored XSS vulnerabilities in the web interface of a Thomson TCW710 router. The vulnerabilities are located in various POST requests, where user-supplied input is not properly sanitized and is later reflected in the web interface.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Lack of input sanitization in the web interface of the Thomson TCW710 router.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the router's configuration. This code could then be executed by any user accessing the router's web interface. This could allow an attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive information such as:
    - Changing router settings
    - Redirecting the user to malicious websites
    - Stealing session cookies
    - Performing other malicious actions
- The XSS is persistent, meaning the malicious code is stored within the router's configuration and will be executed every time the affected pages are accessed.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker must be able to access the router's web interface. This could be achieved by:
    - Having access to the local network the router is connected to
    - Being able to trick a user on the local network to access a malicious link that sends a crafted request to the router
    - Exploiting a vulnerability that allows for remote access to the router's web interface.
- The attacker would send a crafted POST request containing a malicious payload in specific parameters to the vulnerable URLs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to the router's web interface (either directly or indirectly).
- Ability to craft HTTP POST requests.
- Knowledge of the vulnerable parameters within the router's web interface.

**Vulnerable parameters and URLs (as identified in the document):**

*   `/goform/wlanPrimaryNetwork`: `ServiceSetIdentifier`
*   `/goform/RGFirewallEL`: `EmailAddress`, `SmtpServerName`
*   `/goform/RgTime`: `TimeServer1`, `TimeServer2`, `TimeServer3`
*   `/goform/RgDdns`: `DdnsHostName`
*   `/goform/RgDhcp`: `PppUserName`
*   `/goform/RgUrlBlock.asp`: `BasicParentalNewKeyword`

The content provides a detailed list of specific vulnerable parameters and URLs, and is therefore more informative than a typical CVE description.
