| [Description](#c0)  Michael Orlitzky   gentoo-dev  2018-07-29 20:42:23 UTC  ``` Our sys-apps/man-db package installs the /usr/bin/mandb program setuid and setgid with owner/group "man". We also install a daily cron job from ${FILESDIR}/man-db.cron that runs as root and executes,    exec nice mandb --quiet  This can be exploited by the "man" user to gain root privileges. For example, the "man" user can simply strip off the setuid/setgid bits:    # su man -s /bin/sh -c 'chmod 755 /usr/bin/mandb'  Now when "mandb" is run in the cron job, it will run with root privileges. But the owner of /usr/bin/mandb has not changed, so the "man" user can write to it because he owns it:    # su man -s /bin/sh -c 'cat < bad-script.sh > /usr/bin/mandb'  Whenever the cron job runs again, the "man" user gains root. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Thomas Deutschmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2018-07-29 22:25:48 UTC  ``` Mh, this sounds like [bug 602588](show_bug.cgi?id=602588 "RESOLVED FIXED - <sys-apps/man-db-2.7.6.1-r2: privilege escalation")... ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Michael Orlitzky   gentoo-dev  2018-07-29 23:06:50 UTC  ``` (In reply to Thomas Deutschmann from [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=662438#c1)) > Mh, this sounds like [bug 602588](show_bug.cgi?id=602588 "RESOLVED FIXED - <sys-apps/man-db-2.7.6.1-r2: privilege escalation")...  I saw that, but the gist of this one is more "the executable shouldn't be owned by 'man' to begin with." The fact that the cron job makes it easy to exploit is only adding insult to injury. If root (or another privileged user) was ever going to run /usr/bin/mandb for any reason, then the "man" user could swap out its contents beforehand. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Lars Wendler (Polynomial-C) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2018-09-17 12:27:24 UTC  ``` See the following upstream commits.  Separate cache owner from --enable-setuid option: <https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/man-db.git/commit/src/Makefile.am?id=0f8b5518949866075c25787bdc4e9c064597c21e>  Eliminate dangerous setgid-root directories: <https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/man-db.git/commit/src/Makefile.am?id=31552334cecee82809059ec598a37d9ea82683f0>   So this looks like being inteded by upstream. CCing Colin so he can perhaps give some more input into this. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Colin Watson    2018-09-17 13:00:04 UTC  ``` I don't think those commits are especially related, except perhaps insofar as they describe existing practice.  This sort of thing is indeed a problem with having setuid-to-non-root executables that might be run as root: such a setup inherently means that root has to trust the user that owns the executable.  I can see a few non-exclusive options:   1) Make mandb setuid root instead, and add code at the start of main() (or maybe in init_security() or something) to drop to MAN_OWNER if necessary.  2) Mitigate the bug by making the cron job run as the man user rather than root; at least then it isn't *guaranteed* that mandb will be run as root.  (Note that Debian's cron jobs have run as the man user for at least 17 years.)  3) Stop installing mandb setuid by default.  Option 1 might be a good idea, and is probably the only way to preserve the setuid setup while immunising against this bug.  On the other hand, it adds a bit more attack surface and would have to be done carefully.  Option 2 seems to have no obvious downsides.  Assuming it works in the Gentoo setup, you surely ought to do this even if it isn't a complete fix for this bug.  Option 3 is almost certainly the right long-term fix. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Larry the Git Cow   gentoo-dev  2019-01-06 15:11:53 UTC  ``` The bug has been referenced in the following commit(s):  <https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/commit/?id=59d4f75abd7dc6b691a95b5447133922ff09ea3f>  commit 59d4f75abd7dc6b691a95b5447133922ff09ea3f Author:     Lars Wendler <polynomial-c@gentoo.org> AuthorDate: 2019-01-06 15:10:21 +0000 Commit:     Lars Wendler <polynomial-c@gentoo.org> CommitDate: 2019-01-06 15:11:41 +0000      sys-apps/man-db: Synced live ebuild.

In the past, I'm almost certain that portage would not change the owner or group of a file that already exists during merge. So, I was expecting /usr/bin/mandb to still be "man:man" after an upgrade.  Good news: it isn't!  Bad news: I don't know why, or if we can rely on that happening. I'm going to ask around to see if something changed in portage to make this reliable.   But the fix generally looks good to me. In the future you might want to create /var/cache/man in src_install, so that you don't have to do it in both the cron job and pkg_preinst, and you don't have to chown/chmod it every time (this can also be dangerous if /var/cache isn't owned by root).  Then, instead of the shell script cron job that we have now, you could put something simpler in /etc/cron.d:    <minute> <hour> * * * man mandb --quiet ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Michael Orlitzky   gentoo-dev  2019-01-07 16:04:57 UTC  ``` (In reply to Michael Orlitzky from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=662438#c7)) >  > In the past, I'm almost certain that portage would not change the owner or > group of a file that already exists during merge. So, I was expecting > /usr/bin/mandb to still be "man:man" after an upgrade. >   This still happens for directories but not for files. I tested back to portage-2.3.6, so we'd best assume the simplest explanation: I'm remembering wrong, and the ownership of *files* will be updated. ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Lars Wendler (Polynomial-C) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2019-01-11 09:02:34 UTC  ``` (In reply to Michael Orlitzky from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=662438#c7)) >  > But the fix generally looks good to me.

No can do as this would put the content of /var/cache/man into the package's content which we wanna avoid (by doing it in pkg_preinst).   > Then, instead of the shell script cron job that we have now, you could put > something simpler in /etc/cron.d: >  >   <minute> <hour> * * * man mandb --quiet  That sounds like a good idea.
