- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation when explaining a find query with a UUID.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the handling of explain commands for find queries, specifically when a UUID is involved. The system fails to properly validate the input, leading to an invariant failure.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A denial of service (DoS) can be triggered.
- **Attack vectors:** A user authorized to perform a specific type of query can trigger the vulnerability by issuing a generic explain command on a find query involving a UUID.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authorized user capable of performing specific types of queries. They do not require any special network access or system privileges beyond this authorization.
