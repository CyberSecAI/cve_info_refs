## Package

cargo

libpulse-binding
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

< 1.2.1

## Patched versions

1.2.1

## Description

### Overview

Version 1.2.1 of the `libpulse-binding` Rust crate, released on the 15th of June 2018, fixed a pair of use-after-free issues with the objects returned by the `get_format_info` and `get_context` methods of `Stream` objects. These objects were mistakenly being constructed without setting an important flag to prevent destruction of the underlying C objects they reference upon their own destruction.

This advisory is being written retrospectively, having previously only been noted in the changelog. No CVE assignment was sought.

### Patches

Users are required to update to version 1.2.1 or newer.

Versions older than 1.2.1 have been yanked from crates.io. This was believed to have already been done at the time of the 1.2.1 release, but upon double checking now they were found to still be available, so has been done now (22nd October 2020).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Stream: Use-after-free with objects returned by `get\_format\_info` and `get\_context`.

## Package

libpulse-binding

## Affected versions

< 1.2.1

## Patched versions

1.2.1

## Description

### Overview

Version 1.2.1 of the `libpulse-binding` Rust crate, released on the 15th of June 2018, fixed a pair of use-after-free issues with the objects returned by the `get_format_info` and `get_context` methods of `Stream` objects. These objects were mistakenly being constructed without setting an important flag to prevent destruction of the underlying C objects they reference upon their own destruction.

This advisory is being written retrospectively, having previously only been noted in the changelog. No CVE assignment was sought.

### Patches

Users are required to update to version 1.2.1 or newer.

Versions older than 1.2.1 have been yanked from crates.io. This was believed to have already been done at the time of the 1.2.1 release, but upon double checking now they were found to still be available, so has been done now (22nd October 2020).

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

No known CVE

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
