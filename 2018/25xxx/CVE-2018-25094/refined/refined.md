Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `image.php` file within the CKEditor file manager. The code directly uses a user-supplied `fid` parameter in the file path without proper sanitization, allowing for path traversal. This vulnerability allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a path traversal issue. The `$_REQUEST['fid']` parameter, meant to specify the file to load, is directly concatenated with `ROOT_PATH` without adequate checks. This allows an attacker to use ".." sequences in the `fid` parameter to navigate outside the intended directory and access arbitrary files on the server's filesystem.
*   **Insecure file inclusion:** The code constructs a file path using the user-supplied `fid` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** A successful exploit would allow an attacker to read any file on the server that the webserver process has permission to access. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information such as configuration files (e.g., database credentials from `database.php` as shown in the example) source code, or other sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP GET request to `image.php`, providing a `fid` parameter that contains path traversal sequences ("../") to access files outside the intended directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable path:** The attacker should know the vulnerable path to the `image.php` file.
*   **No prior authentication required:** The vulnerability is present before the authentication check, it is exploitable without requiring login.

**Additional Information:**

*   The code attempts to perform some basic checks such as `strpos($_REQUEST['fid'], '..') === false || strpos($_REQUEST['fid'], '.php') === false`, however this check is flawed. The vulnerable code is:
    ```php
    if(!Kotchasan\Login::isMember() || strpos($_REQUEST['fid'], '..') === false || strpos($_REQUEST['fid'], '.php') === false) exit();
    ```
    The `||` operator means if any of the conditions are true, the code will exit. Since `strpos` returns `false` if the string is not found, this code essentially allows any path with `..` or `.php` in the `fid` parameter, as the result of strpos will be false and therefore the expression will evaluate to true which will cause the program to exit. 

    The correct check should have used `&&` instead of `||`, to check if the user is not logged in *and* if the path includes `..` *and* if the path includes `.php`
