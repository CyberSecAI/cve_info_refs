The provided content is related to CVE-2018-25065.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is that tag functions' output was not escaped by default, unlike parser functions. This allowed for the possibility of XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to unescaped output from tag functions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the output of tag functions, leading to XSS attacks that could potentially steal user sessions, deface websites, or redirect users to malicious sites.

**Attack vectors:**
- By using tag functions with malicious input.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to insert malicious content into the tag function's input, likely through a MediaWiki page that allows user-contributed content.

**Technical details:**
- The commit message states "SECURITY: Parse tag function input as wikitext to prevent XSS".
- The code changes modify the tag functions `formatNumber`, `grammar`, `plural`, and `linktrail` in `I18nTags_body.php` to use `$parser->recursiveTagParse()` to parse the output of tag functions as wikitext. This ensures that the output is properly escaped, mitigating the risk of XSS.
-  The version in extension.json file is updated from "2016-02-20" to "2018-08-06".
