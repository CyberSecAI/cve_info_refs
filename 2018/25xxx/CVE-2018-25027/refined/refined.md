  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `get_format_info` and `get_context` methods of `Stream` objects were constructing objects without setting a flag to prevent the destruction of underlying C objects when the Rust objects were destroyed.",

      "Use-after-free"

    "attack_vectors": "By calling the `get_format_info` or `get_context` methods and using the returned object after it has been deallocated.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to call the vulnerable functions of the libpulse-binding library."
