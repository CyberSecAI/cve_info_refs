Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the unsafe use of Rust's `unsafe` keyword within the `actix-web` codebase, leading to memory safety issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unsound Coercion:** Immutable references are improperly coerced into mutable references.
- **Lifetime Extension:** Lifetimes of strings are extended beyond their valid scope.
- **Incorrect `Send` Trait Implementation:** The `Send` marker trait is added to objects that are not actually safe to be sent between threads.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to memory corruption, most likely resulting in use-after-free scenarios. This could cause a variety of issues, including crashes and potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves triggering the vulnerable code paths in `actix-web`, which could occur through normal network interactions with the web server. The specifics of the vulnerable code paths are not provided in this summary, but the linked issue #289 might contain additional details.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker would likely need to send specifically crafted requests to the vulnerable web server to trigger the memory corruption issues.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was initially raised on June 8, 2018 and patched in version 0.7.15
- This advisory covers multiple CVEs: CVE-2018-25024, CVE-2018-25025, and CVE-2018-25026.
- The `actix-web` team had to perform significant refactoring to resolve the issues.
