{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper path sanitization in archive extraction.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of file paths within archives (zip, tar, tgz). Specifically, the code fails to sanitize filenames containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., ../../evil.sh), allowing files to be written outside the intended target directory.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can overwrite files outside of the target directory, including executable files and configuration files, potentially leading to remote command execution on the victim's machine, or other system compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious archive containing files with directory traversal sequences.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to create a specially crafted archive with malicious file paths and have the victim application extract this archive."
