### @satchmorun **[satchmorun](/satchmorun)** commented [Jun 7, 2018](#issue-330465345)

Fixes [#2996](https://github.com/harvesthq/chosen/issues/2996).

An easy fix, we were simply missing a call to `this.escape_html`. To be honest, I'm surprised this hasn't been a reported issue yet.

As a bonus, there are even tests for red-greening the fix!

Many thanks to [@cade](https://github.com/cade) for his assistance with figuring out was was going on in the Ancient Technology™ test (read: Prototype JS).

Sorry, something went wrong.

Quick note: this uses the idiom `div.innerHTML = tmpl` instead of what we've
been using in our other tests, which is `div.update(tmpl)` because of some fun
