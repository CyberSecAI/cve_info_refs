## Use of Uninitialized Resource in smallvec

High severity

[Vulnerability details](/advisories/GHSA-55m5-whcv-c49c)
[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-55m5-whcv-c49c/dependabot)

## Package

cargo

smallvec
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

< 0.6.13

## Patched versions

0.6.13

## Description

Affected versions of this crate called mem::uninitialized() to create values of a user-supplied type T. This is unsound e.g. if T is a reference type (which must be non-null and thus may not remain uninitialized). The flaw was corrected by avoiding the use of mem::uninitialized(), using MaybeUninit instead.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Use MaybeUninit for storage of inline items.

```
This is a backport of [#162](https://github.com/servo/rust-smallvec/pull/162) to the smallvec 0.6 branch. To avoid bumping the
minimum Rust version, the `maybe-uninit` crate is used in place of
`std::mem::MaybeUninit`.  To avoid breaking changes, the `Array::ptr` and
`ptr_mut` methods are retained but are no longer used, and the API to
`from_buf_and_len_unchecked` is unchanged.

# smallvec creates uninitialized value of any type
Affected versions of this crate called `mem::uninitialized()` to create values of a user-supplied type `T`.
This is unsound e.g. if `T` is a reference type (which must be non-null and thus may not remain uninitialized).
The flaw was corrected by avoiding the use of `mem::uninitialized()`, using `MaybeUninit` instead.

## Description

[![@mbrubeck](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5920?u=2764d32fe40d1c75bc891bdbe0bc340bf52e7fe7&v=4&size=48)](/mbrubeck)[mbrubeck](https://github.com/mbrubeck)opened [on Sep 25, 2018](https://github.com/servo/rust-smallvec/issues/126#issue-363693428)

Creating an array with `mem::uninitialized` may be UB if the array's elements contain non-null types (like `&T`) or uninhabited types (like `!`) or other types that have invalid values.

This can result in undefined behavior even if you never read the elements directly while they are uninitialized. For example, this program prints "true" if optimizations are enabled, when built with current rustc:

```
fn main() {
    let x: Option<[&u8; 1]> = unsafe { Some(std::mem::uninitialized()) };
    println!("{}", x.is_none());
}
```

`SmallVec` isn't eligible for null pointer optimization, so it isn't affected by this. However, it's possible that a future Rust compiler could add other optimizations that break if SmallVec uses `mem::uninitialized` to create arrays of such types.

The ideal solution is to switch from `uninitialized` to the new `MaybeUninit` union ([rust-lang/rfcs#1892](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1892)) when it becomes stable.

### Description

Affected versions of this crate called `mem::uninitialized()` to create values of a user-supplied type `T`.
This is unsound e.g. if `T` is a reference type (which must be non-null and thus may not remain uninitialized).

The flaw was corrected by avoiding the use of `mem::uninitialized()`, using `MaybeUninit` instead.
