  "CVE-2018-25032": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "zlib before 1.2.12 allows memory corruption when deflating (i.e., when compressing) if the input has many distant matches.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Out-of-bounds Write",
      "Memory Corruption"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a denial of service condition, corrupt memory, or potentially execute custom code.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by compressing crafted input. A malicious server could also potentially use this vulnerability to send crafted compressed data to a client.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control the input that is being compressed, or have a position to send crafted compressed data to a vulnerable system."
