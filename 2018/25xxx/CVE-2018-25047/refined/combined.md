[`ffa2b81`](/smarty-php/smarty/commit/ffa2b81a8e354a49fd8a2f24742dc9dc399e8007)

If you use the {mailto} plugin in your templates, please check if you are escaping the address value explicitly like this `{mailto address=$htmladdress|escape}`. This could cause problems through double escaping.

* Fixed PHP8.1 deprecation errors in capitalize modifier [#789](https://github.com/smarty-php/smarty/issues/789)
* Fixed use of `rand()` without a parameter in math function [#794](https://github.com/smarty-php/smarty/issues/794)
* Fixed unselected year/month/day not working in html\_select\_date [#395](https://github.com/smarty-php/smarty/issues/395)

## Description

[![@iricartb](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20545552?u=f1f7d0a2409c549392acefd3ca442f231aa1d92b&v=4&size=48)](/iricartb)[iricartb](https://github.com/iricartb)opened [on Jun 18, 2018](https://github.com/smarty-php/smarty/issues/454#issue-333345886)

I found a bug in the **Smarty package**, specifically in the **smarty\_function\_mailto($params)** function.

Remote exploitation of such vulnerability is unlikely, but it is still advisable to take it into account.

A web page that uses this function and that could be parameterized using GET or POST input parameters could cause the injection of JavaScript code of a malicious user and cause cross-site scripting attacks.

Using the following code you can inject JavaScript code into the **smarty\_function\_mailto** function.

===============================================================

$params = array(

'encode'=>'javascript',

'address'=>'iricartb@gmail.com">iricartb@gmail.com'); alert("- JavaScript Injected -"); //',

);

echo smarty\_function\_mailto($params);

===============================================================

If you use the {mailto} plugin in your templates, please check if you are escaping the address value explicitly like this `{mailto address=$htmladdress|escape}`. This could cause problems through double escaping.

### Security

* Applied appropriate javascript and html escaping in mailto plugin to counter injection attacks [#454](https://github.com/smarty-php/smarty/issues/454)

### Fixed

* Fixed use of `rand()` without a parameter in math function [#794](https://github.com/smarty-php/smarty/issues/794)
* Fixed unselected year/month/day not working in html\_select\_date [#395](https://github.com/smarty-php/smarty/issues/395)
