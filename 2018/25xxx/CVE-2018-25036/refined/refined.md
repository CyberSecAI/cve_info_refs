{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The web interface of the Thomson TCW710 router does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for XSS injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Multiple persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in various POST request parameters. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in multiple POST request parameters, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser when they access the router's web interface. This could lead to various malicious actions, including but not limited to: session hijacking, defacement of the router's interface, or redirection to malicious websites. Since these XSS vulnerabilities are persistent, the malicious scripts are stored in the router configuration and will be executed whenever a user accesses the vulnerable pages.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the web interface of the router. An attacker can send crafted POST requests to specific URLs (e.g., /goform/wlanPrimaryNetwork, /goform/RGFirewallEL, etc.) with malicious JavaScript payloads in vulnerable parameters.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router's web interface, which implies the attacker needs to be on the same network as the router or have some means of network access to the router's web interface. This may require the attacker to have a valid login to the router's configuration page if it's not publicly accessible."
