{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Lack of proper input sanitization on multiple parameters within the web interface of the Thomson TCW710 router.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Multiple persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are present in the router's web interface. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in various POST request parameters, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the router's web interface. This could lead to a variety of malicious actions, including: \n - Stealing user credentials or session cookies.\n - Redirecting users to malicious websites.\n - Modifying the router's configuration.\n - Performing actions on behalf of the user.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the web interface of the router. An attacker can craft malicious POST requests containing XSS payloads in the vulnerable parameters.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to interact with the router's web interface, which typically requires network access to the router. This could be achieved if the attacker is on the same local network as the router or if they can access the router's web interface remotely through port forwarding or other means."
