The provided content contains information about a commit and a release that introduce a new `text` attribute to the `json2html` library, designed to mitigate XSS vulnerabilities.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The original `json2html` library used `innerHTML` to inject content into HTML elements, which made it vulnerable to XSS attacks if the data being inserted contained malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **XSS vulnerability:** The use of `innerHTML` allowed the injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code, leading to potential XSS attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into a web page by controlling the data being processed by `json2html`, leading to a variety of attacks, including session hijacking, defacement, and data theft.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the data used by `json2html`. If an attacker can influence the data processed by `json2html` (e.g., through user input or by compromising a data source), they can insert malicious HTML or JavaScript.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to control the input data provided to the json2html function.

**Mitigation:**
*  The commit introduces a new "text" attribute which uses `innerText` instead of `innerHTML` to inject data into HTML elements. This prevents XSS by escaping HTML tags.

**Code Changes**

*   **json2html.js:** The commit modifies the `json2html.js` file to include the new `text` attribute which uses `toText` to encode potentially harmful content. The `toText` function performs HTML escaping.
*   **test/test.text.js:** A new test file is added to verify that the text attribute works as expected, correctly escaping HTML content.

This commit addresses the vulnerability by introducing a safe way to render text without allowing arbitrary HTML execution.
