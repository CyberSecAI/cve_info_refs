Since OSM data, changeset comments and potentially even OSM usernames may
contain HTML code, it's better to use the textContent property to insert
such values, since innerHTML would result in interpretation of this HTML
code which might even result in the execution of JavaScript code [1].
The Underscore.js template is also affected by such issues, which can be
mitigated by using <%- instead of <%= for interpolations [2].

### @mstock **[mstock](/mstock)** commented [Feb 22, 2018](#issue-299496845)

Issue [#56](https://github.com/osmlab/show-me-the-way/issues/56) requested that nodes should also be displayed. The suggested changes in this pull request add this functionality by placing a marker for nodes that have been created, modified or deleted if the node has any tags.

Since this requires that tags are also part of the data structure that is provided by [`osm-stream`](https://github.com/osmlab/osm-stream), it currently has no visible effect though, since tag parsing for nodes only becomes available if/when [osmlab/osm-stream#13](https://github.com/osmlab/osm-stream/pull/13) (or something similar) gets merged, which currently has a syntax error that could be fixed by applying a trivial patch like the one in [mstock/osm-stream@56bf6bd](https://github.com/mstock/osm-stream/commit/56bf6bd5158ade7eb0fad83d48c746156e4e833e). Once that pull request is merged, somebody would have to cut a release of [`osm-stream`](https://github.com/osmlab/osm-stream) and then the corresponding dependency in [`show-me-the-way`](https://github.com/osmlab/show-me-the-way) would need updating.

The first five commits in this pull request are mainly smaller code cleanups and fixes - I can extract them to a different branch and create a separate pull request or even drop them if you prefer.

For demonstration purposes, I've deployed a build with the node feature that uses a patched version of [`osm-stream`](https://github.com/osmlab/osm-stream) [on my Github page](https://mstock.github.io/show-me-the-way/).

Sorry, something went wrong.

| [@mstock](https://github.com/mstock) thanks for working on this! I tagged a version of osm-stream with the fix for more than ways as 0.0.14. Can you update the package.json here so it uses it, then we can try it out? |

| You're welcome :). I just pushed another commit which updates `osm-stream` to `osmlab/osm-stream#v0.0.14`. Since there does not seem to be a release on NPM, yet, I assume using the Github reference in `package.json` is the right way to do this. |

| Actually, I don't think it is - the GitHub page uses the 'compiled' [`bundle.js`](https://github.com/osmlab/show-me-the-way/blob/gh-pages/js/bundle.js), and that has not been touched for a few months. I did not include a 'compiled' `bundle.js` in my pull request, so somebody still has to do that and commit/push the 'compiled' file. I'm not sure what the right or best workflow is, but I tend to think that it is better to not include a 'compiled' version in pull requests, since this will cause conflicts if multiple pull requests get merged at the same time, as they would all contain a different variant of the 'compiled' file (and to get all the new things, a rebuild after the merges would be required anyway). It could also be abused to smuggle in unwanted stuff (even though the 'compiled' file is not unreadable, there still can be a massive diff that had to be reviewed to be somewhat safe) or it could be out of sync with the rest of the pull request, and it's also not clear if it still can be built on another machine if it is only part of the pull request and not (re)built by a maintainer. Btw.: I think [#56](https://github.com/osmlab/show-me-the-way/issues/56) can be closed once `bundle.js` got built and published. |

| I took a look at the 'compiled' `bundle.js`, and it seems like the build did not include `osm-stream` 0.0.14 as specified in `package.json` (but an older version instead), so I guess that your `node_modules` directory still contained an older version. This was likely either caused by `npm install` somehow failing to download this version (the syntax I used to specify the version seems to [require at least `npm` 1.1.65](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#github-urls)), or not running `npm install` at all before building the bundle.  In order to automate the build with GitHub pages, one could probably use [TravisCI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/pages/) - I've never tried this though, and since it requires a personal token, TravisCI will likely get write access to all repositories the creator of the token has access to (so I'd try to create a second GitHub user for this, and only grant this user access to those repositories where this is required - I don't know if this is actually supported though), and it might also be a good idea to start doing development on a different (like `master`) and protected branch and 'reserve' the `gh-pages` branch for the build results from TravisCI. |

| I pushed the updated bundle.js and am seeing nodes on the deployed site. Looks good!  This highlights how much is happening in OSM, and that this tool might need to group these changes together so that we spend less time jumping around the world. |
