The provided content relates to CVE-2018-25064.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the usage of `innerHTML` and `<%=` for interpolations in the Underscore.js template when rendering OSM data, changeset comments, and potentially even OSM usernames which could contain HTML code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to the interpretation of HTML code when using `innerHTML` and the vulnerable Underscore.js template interpolation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code, which would then be executed in the context of the user's browser when they view the affected content. This could lead to various malicious activities like session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the application.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker can inject malicious HTML code (including Javascript) within OSM data, changeset comments, or usernames. This injected code will be rendered by the vulnerable parts of the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to inject HTML code into data that is displayed by the application. This could be through contributions to OpenStreetMap, for instance by adding malicious code to a comment or a username.
