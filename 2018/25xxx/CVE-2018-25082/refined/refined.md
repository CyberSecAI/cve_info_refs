### Vulnerability:
XML External Entity (XXE) injection

### Root Cause:
The `weixin-python` SDK was vulnerable to XXE injection due to the usage of `xml.etree.ElementTree` to parse XML data without disabling external entity resolution.

### Impact:
An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to read sensitive files, trigger denial-of-service, or perform server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks.

### Attack Vector:
By sending a crafted XML message to the affected endpoint.

### Fix:
The vulnerability was fixed by disabling external entity resolution when parsing XML data using `etree.XMLParser(resolve_entities=False)`. This prevents the XML parser from loading external entities, mitigating the XXE vulnerability.
The fix was applied to both `weixin/msg.py` and `weixin/pay.py`.
