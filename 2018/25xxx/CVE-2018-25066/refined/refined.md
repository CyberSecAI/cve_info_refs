The provided content relates to CVE-2018-25066.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of input data in the `sqlBuilder.js` file, specifically within the functions that construct SQL queries. The code was not escaping identifiers (table and column names), leading to potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the unsanitized use of table and column names in the `getInsertSql`, `getUpdateSql`, and `getDelSql` functions. This allowed for SQL injection via crafted input data.

- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to:
    - Data breaches: An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    - Data modification: An attacker could modify or delete data in the database.
    - Full control of the database: An attacker could gain administrative access to the underlying database, depending on the database server privileges.

- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the `tableName` and `data` parameters in the `insert`, `update`, and `delete` functions in the `NodeBatis` class and `sqlBuilder.js`. An attacker could inject malicious SQL code by crafting the data passed to these methods.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to control the input data that gets passed to the vulnerable `insert`, `update`, or `delete` methods. The attacker also needs to be able to interact with the application's database through the `NodeBatis` library.
