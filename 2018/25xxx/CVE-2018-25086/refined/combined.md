[`c380d34`](/sea75300/fanpresscm3/commit/c380d343c2107fcee55ab00eb8d189ce5e03369b)

Todays new release 3.6.4 of FanPress CM contains fixes for two issues.

* Using PHP 7 an issue might prevent the system help from loading correctly resulting in an empty page.
* The second fix disables <script> tags inside the template preview due to possible use for cross-site-scripting inside FanPress CM.

The development of FanPress CM 4 started recently. The new major version will come with a completely new extension system and other major changes. See <https://github.com/sea75300/fanpresscm4> for further progress.
