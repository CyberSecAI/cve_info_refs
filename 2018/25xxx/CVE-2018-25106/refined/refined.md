{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The original SQL query used string concatenation with the LIKE operator and an unsanitized `$nebula_id` variable, which could lead to SQL injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. This could compromise the entire database and application.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious value for `$nebula_id`, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL into the database query.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to influence the value of the `$nebula_id` variable used in the SQL query."
