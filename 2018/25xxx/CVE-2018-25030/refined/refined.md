The provided content describes a vulnerability found in the "Secure Private Browser" app for iPad, which is identified on VulDB as [https://vuldb.com/?id.106056](https://vuldb.com/?id.106056), but is not related to CVE-2018-25030.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a race condition caused by the app not properly handling the sequence of actions when a video is minimized and the app is reopened. The app does not always use the LocalAuthentication framework to ensure the video is properly locked before the initial authentication dialog is displayed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Race condition in handling video playback and app authentication
- Improper usage of LocalAuthentication framework
- Failure to properly handle app state changes during multitasking

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Bypassing the app's authentication mechanism
- Exposing the last accessed content (video) in the multitasking preview, even after the app is closed.
- Allowing unauthorized playback of minimized video content in multitasking preview without requiring authentication.

**Attack vectors:**
- Requires user interaction to play and minimize a video within the app.
- Relies on the specific timing and sequence of actions by the user, specifically:
    1. Open, authenticate, play, minimize, then close the app.
    2. Reopen the app and maximize the video
    3. Cancel Authentication and then reopen the multitasking switcher.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have physical access to the device.
- The attacker must be aware of the vulnerability and how to trigger it.
- No special privileges are needed for the attacker.

**Additional Details:**
- The article mentions that a certain degree of "incorrect use" is required, which implies that it may not be easily exploitable in every day use.
- The app should ideally use the LocalAuthentication API to close the video or display an overlay before the initial authentication, instead of handling the video after authentication.
- The manufacturer did not respond to vulnerability disclosure
