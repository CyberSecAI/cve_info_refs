# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

This may have some justification for testing purposes, i.e. to get

determinism, but in code relying on cryptography this is unlikely to be

required, and I believe in that kind of circumstance it can be

reimplemented in the test without too much difficulty, both clarifying

the intent and avoiding any accidental use of this dangerous fallback in

production.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| I'm not sure what the best way to document this is.  Previously, random data could have been created in circumstances where `get_weak` was used and no urandom device was available. I think Win32 at risk of being affected if the corresponding module was not installed.  This also presents a misconception, /dev/urandom is not actually "weak" in practice, except in very specific circumstances. Though technically it may produce non random data (e.g. on a headless server with no stored entropy) but I think the current nomenclature is still misleading, for reasons relating to why this code should be removed. |

| to save any reviewers time following links, travis check failed because I didn't port this to ruby  lol, I turned on travis for all my repos, but I only bother to add a config file when it fails for the first time, to remind me that the repo still exists :) |
