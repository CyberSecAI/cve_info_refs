Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `pullit` package used the `eval()` function to execute git commands. This function interprets strings as Javascript code, leading to arbitrary command execution. The git commands are constructed using user-controlled input, which comes from a git branch name on GitHub.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** The use of `eval()` on user-controlled input allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the system running `pullit`.
- **Insecure use of `eval()`:**  The `eval()` function should not be used to process external input because it can introduce security holes. 

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system where the vulnerable `pullit` application is running. This could lead to various impacts such as:
    - Data breaches
    - System compromise
    - Malware installation
    - Denial of service

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker creates a malicious branch name on a Github repository.
- The user then uses the `pullit` CLI tool to list open pull requests in the repository.
- The user selects the malicious pull request to check out locally.
- The `pullit` tool processes the malicious branch name which is then executed via `eval()`, resulting in command execution.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create a branch on a public or private GitHub repository that a user has access to.
- The attacker needs the victim user to use the `pullit` tool on a repository containing the malicious branch.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges on the target machine to execute the attack.
- The user must interact with the pullit tool and select the malicious pull request for the exploit to be triggered.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in `pullit` versions prior to 1.4.0.
- Snyk has a published code exploit for this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code).
- The vulnerability was initially disclosed on October 24, 2017 and fixed on February 19, 2018.
