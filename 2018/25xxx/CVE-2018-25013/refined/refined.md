Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-25013:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read in the `ShiftBytes()` function within the `libwebp` library. This is caused by a race condition during the decoding process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, which occurs when the `ShiftBytes()` function attempts to access memory outside of its allocated buffer. This is caused by the race condition when multiple threads are running concurrently

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Confidentiality and Service Availability:** The vulnerability can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information (data confidentiality) due to out of bounds memory read. Additionally it can impact service availability due to potential crashes or unexpected behavior caused by the memory access issue.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted WebP image file that exploits the race condition in `ShiftBytes()`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious webp file to be decoded by the vulnerable libwebp library.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was fixed in `libwebp` version 1.0.1.
*   The fix includes waiting for all threads to complete in the `DecodeRemaining` function to resolve the race condition.
*   The vulnerability was originally reported through the oss-fuzz project and is identified as issue 9417.
*   Red Hat assigned bug ID 1956926 to track this vulnerability.
*   Red Hat has released a security advisory (RHSA-2021:4231) to address this issue in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.
