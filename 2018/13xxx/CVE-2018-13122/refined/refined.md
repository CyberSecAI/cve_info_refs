The provided content relates to CVE-2018-13122.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `onefilecms.php` script in OneFileCMS allows attackers to delete arbitrary files and folders due to insufficient input validation on the delete screen.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted file deletion: The application allows the deletion of any file or folder accessible by the web server.
- Lack of input sanitization: The `i`, `f` parameters are not properly validated or sanitized before being used in file deletion operations.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can delete arbitrary files and directories on the server, leading to potential data loss, service disruption, or complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request manipulation: The attacker sends a crafted GET request to `onefilecms.php` with specific values for the `i` (path), `f` (filename) and `p` parameters.
- Direct access: The vulnerability can be triggered through direct access to the `onefilecms.php` script with manipulated query string parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to the web application: The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable `onefilecms.php` script.
- Authentication: The attacker needs valid username and password credentials to access the web application, as stated in the description "access http://fragrant:30001/OneFileCMS/onefilecms.php by username/password".
- Ability to craft HTTP requests: The attacker must be able to modify the GET parameters in the HTTP request.
