{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-provided input in the 'Full name' field when creating or editing users.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the 'Full name' field of user profiles. When an administrator accesses the 'Manager Users' or 'Web Users' pages, the injected script is executed in the administrator's browser. This can lead to cookie theft, CSRF bypass, and ultimately, admin account takeover.",
  "Attack vectors": "An authenticated attacker with user management permissions can inject a malicious script into the 'Full name' field through the user management interface.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have an account with user management privileges within the ClipperCMS application."
