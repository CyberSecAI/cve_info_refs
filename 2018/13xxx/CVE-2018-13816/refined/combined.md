SUMMARY

The latest update for TIM 1531 IRC ﬁxes a vulnerability. The device was missing proper authentication
when connecting on port 102/tcp, although conﬁgured.

An attacker needs to be able to connect to port 102/tcp of an affected device in order to exploit this
vulnerability.

The vulnerability could allow an attacker to perform administrative operations.

Siemens has released updates for TIM 1531 IRC modules.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-13816

The device was missing proper authentication on port 102/tcp, although conﬁgured.

Successful exploitation requires an attacker to be able to send packets to port 102/tcp of the affected
device. No user interaction and no user privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this vulnerability was known.
