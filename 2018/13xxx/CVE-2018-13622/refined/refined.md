The provided content consists of two GitHub pages. Neither page contains information about a specific vulnerability, but rather shows the structure of a GitHub repository named "EtherTokens" belonging to the user "BlockChainsSecurity". One of the pages shows the main page of the repository and the other shows the "ObjectToken" directory within that repository.

The "ObjectToken" directory contains two markdown files: "mint integer overflow.md" and "sell integer overflow.md".  Based on the file names, it's likely these files describe vulnerabilities related to integer overflows in the minting and selling functionalities of an EtherToken contract, but the content of these files are not present in the provided data.

Based on the information available, I cannot verify if the content relates to CVE-2018-13622 as there is no mention of the vulnerability itself.
