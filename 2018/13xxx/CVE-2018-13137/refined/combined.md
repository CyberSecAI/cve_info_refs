I use Events Manager on several sites, and Events Manager Pro on one, I’ve been very pleased with this plugin. You do need to know a little HTML and CSS to make customizations, but I’ve found this plugin much more stable and easy to use than the Events Calendar, where every major update seems to break your customizations. Support has been good – a little slow on my last request, but it was the holidays. Once you figure out the settings and shortcodes (it’s worth spending the time, and there is documentation) you are off and running. Highly recommended.

Il plugin è essenziale, semplice molto versatile. Se minimamente si sa giocare con gli shortcode si fanno tantissime cose

We use the pro version. Do not recommend at the moment. Bugs were reported, even the location of the bugs were reported! Support does not answer within a week and all you get is “made another follow-up to the Devs”. “another” – says everything

Have the Pro-Account. Won’t suggest! The Plugin cost me all nervs – as Webdesigner you need a Plugin that works – this is full of bugs and the support is responding days later and sometimes no response at all. Sorry! This is not for professional use reccomandable!

If you try to contact support you simply don’t get an answer. Luckily I tried that before buying the PRO version. I can only advise everyone not to get the PRO version because I don’t think it will be any better.

I have been using this plugin for years for a Role Model School Volunteer non-profit. With its hooks, I was able to create a variety of dashboards and custom screens. Very flexible. Pro version gives you access to even more features and a Forum of peers helping each other out.

### [CVE-2018-14846 - Multiple Stored XSS in Multi Step Form](https://ansawaf.blogspot.com/2018/10/cve-2018-14846-multiple-stored-xss-in.html)

Exploit Author: Mohammed Ansari(ansaert@gmail.com)

LinkedIn: <https://www.linkedin.com/in/ansaert/>

Discovered Date: July 27 2018

Affected Version: 1.2.5

Fixed Version: 1.2.8 Released on Aug 3 2018.

Active installations: 7,000+

Plugin: <https://wordpress.org/plugins/multi-step-form/>

# Description

Multi
Step Form has a drag & drop enabled form builder for quick and
intuitive creation of nice-looking multi step forms. Forms can be
embedded on any page or post with short codes.

# Classification

Type:  Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')

CWE: [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

# Proof of Concept

There is multiple stored and reflected XSS vulnerabilities in file class-mondula-multistep-forms-admin.php in ***fw\_wizard\_save*** action. The reason - unsanitized user's input from the following parameters:

| `data[wizard][steps][0][title]` `data[wizard][steps][0][headline]` `data[wizard][steps][0][copy_text]` `data[wizard][steps][0][parts][0][title]` `data[wizard][steps][0][parts][0][blocks][0][label]` `data[wizard][steps][0][parts][0][blocks][0][format]` `data[wizard][steps][0][parts][0][blocks][1][label]` `data[wizard][steps][0][parts][0][blocks][2][label]` `data[wizard][steps][0][parts][0][blocks][3][label]` `data[wizard][settings][thankyou]` |
| --- |

Exploiting this vulnerability requires authentication.

**Example:**

Locate Multi step form and enter payload and Save. The values are passed via Ajax →  http://localhost/word496/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php

| `data%5Bwizard%5D%5Btitle%5D=My+Multi+Step+Form%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(22)%3B%3C%2Fscript%3E` |
