Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-13137:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input within the Events Manager plugin for WordPress. Specifically, the plugin fails to properly sanitize several parameters related to event and location slugs within the `events-manager-options` page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the database via vulnerable parameters and will be executed when a user views the affected areas of the website.
- **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (CWE-79):** The plugin fails to neutralize user-supplied input before including it in the web page, allowing for XSS attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- **Session Hijacking:**  An attacker could potentially steal session cookies or other sensitive data, gaining unauthorized access to the victim's account.
- **Website Defacement:** Attackers can alter the content or appearance of the website.
- **Malware Distribution:**  An attacker could redirect users to malicious websites or inject malicious code leading to drive-by downloads.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the `wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=event&page=events-manager-options` page, including the malicious payload within vulnerable parameters.
- **Admin Settings Page:** The vulnerability is present within the plugin's settings page, which is only accessible to authenticated users with administrative capabilities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be a logged in user with administrative privileges on the WordPress website. This indicates a privilege escalation vulnerability where the attacker could be an administrator level user of the vulnerable WordPress website.

**Vulnerable Parameters:**
The following parameters are vulnerable to stored XSS:
- `dbem_cp_events_slug`
- `dbem_cp_locations_slug`
- `dbem_taxonomy_category_slug`
- `dbem_taxonomy_tag_slug`

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered on July 3, 2018.
- Affected Version: 5.9.4
- Fixed Version: 5.9.5, released on July 18, 2018.
- The vulnerable plugin had 100,000+ active installations at the time of discovery.
- The provided proof of concept demonstrates the injection of an alert message using the `dbem_cp_events_slug` parameter, but the other mentioned parameters are also vulnerable.
- The provided information gives a clear attack vector, including the vulnerable parameters and a sample payload, which is more detailed than the description in the CVE placeholder.
