- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Integer overflow in the `sell` function when calculating the amount of Ether to send to the seller (`amount * sellPrice`).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The multiplication `amount * sellPrice` can result in an integer overflow if `amount` and `sellPrice` are large enough. When the multiplication overflows, it wraps around to a very small number, often zero.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker (or the contract owner) can set a high `sellPrice` value. When a user sells their tokens, the multiplication overflows, resulting in the seller receiving little or no Ether, while the contract receives the tokens. The seller loses tokens and gets very little or no ether in return.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by a user selling tokens, if the `sellPrice` is maliciously set by the contract owner to a value that causes an integer overflow when multiplied by the `amount`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to control the `sellPrice` (typically the contract owner), and a user must attempt to sell tokens.
