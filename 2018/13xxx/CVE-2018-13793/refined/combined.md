New Functionality

1.  Security

1.1. Broken Access Control

The  POST  request  /FlexiCapture12/Login/Server/SevaUserProfile  no  longer  uses  the  FlexiCaptureTmsSts2  parameter.  The
behavior of the web application is currently not affected when editing the request.

1.2. Cross-Site Request Forgery

For all web applications (Web Verification, Web Scanning, Web Capture, Monitoring and Administration, Login), the ASP.NET MVC
AntiForgeryToken mechanism (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd470175(v=vs.118).aspx) has been applied.

In addition, the validation of AntiForgeryToken has been added for POST methods that require it.

1.3. Weak Password Policy

Now a user’s password should contain English upper case and lower case letters as well as Arabic numerals or special characters
(! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) _ - + : ; , . > < =").

1.4. User Impersonation Allowed Privilege Escalation

Not an issue.

The requests show that some user with Basic authentication tries to open a session with the Administrator role (roleType=10) and
the non-existing station type (stationType = 39). The session opens successfully, meaning that the user is authenticated in IIS and
authorized by FlexiCapture to open sessions as Admin, i.e. he has administrative permissions in FlexiCapture.

1.5. Clear Text Data Transmission (ABBY-014-2-2)

Not an issue, it is an infrastructure setting. Admin Guide explains that HTTPS should be enabled for the production environment
and describes how to achieve this.

When FlexiCapture is installed by means of the automatic installer, it works using HTTP. We can easily forbid communication via
HTTP and require HTTPS only but:

•

•

it is hard to setup HTTPS automatically, manual steps are described in the Admin Guide . Configuration is determined by
the infrastructure.
If we only prohibit HTTP and do not setup HTTPS automatically, all our demo installations of FlexiCapture will require
obtaining and installing a certificate and the program will not work from scratch. We, on the other hand, would like to
avoid that and keep demo scenario simple.

All installations in production must use HTTPS, this is configured at the infrastructure level. This is described in the Admin Guide.

1.6. No Account Lockout

We created a counter that logs logon attempts. It is incremented in case of unsuccessful logon. When a user runs out of attempts
to log on to the system, the system temporarily locks the user’s account.

2.  Synchronizing AD groups from multiple domains

It is possible to synchronize (manually or by external web request) users with Active Directory when multiple AD domains are
used. Previously, users could only be synchronized with one AD domain. Users from different domains should be imported and
synchronized alternately, groups will not be re-written.

How to synchronize groups from different domains:

•  During  the  first  import  form  AD,  the  path  to  the  server  is  saved  in  FlexiCapture  database in  the  domain.com\group1
the  name  will  be  replaced  by

If  a  group  name  changes,

format.  Synchronization  works  as  usual.
domain.com\group1NewName in the database.

•  At  the  same  time,  it  is  only  possible  to  synchronize  groups  of  one  domain,  which  is  indicated  in  the  settings.  To

synchronize groups from other domains, it is necessary to change setting consecutively and synchronize.

After the upgrade to the current version:

The database must be updated to ver. 125.
For all objects already imported from AD, the same path that was used during the last import or synchronization is used.

•
•
•  During the first synchronization (not import), the path will be replaced by domain.com\group1.

Troubleshooting:

After the upgrade, some groups stopped synchronizing. This can be caused by the incorrect path saved during the upgrade or a
changed server name (e.g. URL was replaced by IP or an alias). Solution: try importing the groups once again (no need to delete
any of them).

Issue description

Installation. Some files were missing from the installation package depending on the selected
configuration.
The following files are added to corresponding installation packages:
TextGraphicsTypeDetection.clc
InvoiceSettings15.dll
OfficeConverter.dll

Installation. During deinstallation all files and the folder itself were deleted.

Installation. If the Application Server is installed without the Processing Server or the Licensing
Server, the user must be requested to input the path to those servers. However, this step was
missing during installation.
Web  Verification Station.  The  station  did  not  open  inside the  tenant  if  web verification was
opened form another tenant.
Web  Verification  Station.  An  error  occurred  during  the  first  launch  of  the  Web  Verification
Station with taskId in the URL.
Reports. The site productivity report and the general operators report failed to be generated
on certain data.
Invoice Project. Sometimes the opened PO table was empty in spite of the fact that the vendor
and BU were filled and there were records in the data set.
Invoice Project. IPE occurred when adding a vendor using API and the vendor has duplicated Id
but different BusinessUnitId and for the BUid column the flag Cannot be empty was switched
off.
It was not possible to create a user in a tenant using API if the user with the same ID already
existed in the default tenant.
Users could have incorrect batch name sending batches from FlexiCapture Mobile Client in case
user name had the Domain\UserID format. Now the prohibited character “\” is replaced by “_”
so batch names are valid.

Known Issue

LibreOffice 6 cannot be used for conversion because FlexiCapture cannot find it due to renamed folder.
Workaround: use LibreOffice 5 which is recommended for enterprise usage and can be downloaded from the official site.
