Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Improper access control. Specifically, several administrative resources in Atlassian Jira did not properly enforce the "WebSudo" re-authentication mechanism.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Missing WebSudo checks:** Certain administrative resources were accessible without requiring an administrator to re-authenticate via WebSudo, after already establishing an administrator session. This allowed bypassing an intended security layer.
*   **Improper Authentication:** The core issue is that authentication was insufficient for specific admin resources and an attacker could bypass the intended authentication checks (WebSudo) after obtaining access to an administrator's session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A remote attacker who has gained access to an administrator's session can access sensitive administrative resources without having to re-authenticate with WebSudo. This could enable them to perform unauthorized administrative actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **Session Hijacking/Compromise:** An attacker must first gain access to a valid administrator's session to exploit this vulnerability. This could be achieved through other exploits, social engineering or any other means of session compromise.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Administrator Session Access:** The attacker needs to have already obtained a valid administrator session to exploit this vulnerability. This is a crucial prerequisite.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker would need network access to the Jira instance.

**Affected Versions:**
*   Atlassian Jira versions before 7.6.9, versions 7.7.0 before 7.7.5, versions 7.8.0 before 7.8.5, versions 7.9.0 before 7.9.3, versions 7.10.0 before 7.10.3, versions 7.11.0 before 7.11.3, versions 7.12.0 before 7.12.3, and before 7.13.1 are vulnerable

**Fix Versions:**
*   The issue was fixed in versions 7.6.9, 7.7.5, 7.8.5, 7.9.3, 7.10.3, 7.11.3, 7.12.3, and 7.13.1
