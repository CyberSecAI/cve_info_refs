The provided content is related to CVE-2018-13011.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A heap-buffer-overflow occurs in the `GPMF_Validate` function within `GPMF_parser.c` at line 129.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: The code attempts to read beyond the allocated memory region on the heap.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Program crash/termination: The AddressSanitizer (ASan) report shows that the program aborts due to the heap-buffer-overflow, leading to a denial of service.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution: Though not explicitly stated, heap overflows can potentially be leveraged for arbitrary code execution if carefully crafted inputs are used.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious GPMF data: The vulnerability is triggered by parsing specially crafted GPMF data. The provided PoC link `https://github.com/Edward-L/my-cve-list/blob/master/gpmf-parser/heap-buffer-overflow-GPMF_parser-c-129-GPMF_Validate.poc` confirms this.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a crafted GPMF file to be processed by the vulnerable code.
