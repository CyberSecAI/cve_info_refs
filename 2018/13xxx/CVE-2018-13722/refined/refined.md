The provided content consists of two HTML pages from GitHub, both related to the same repository, `BlockChainsSecurity/EtherTokens`. Neither of these pages contains specific information about a vulnerability related to CVE-2018-13722. The first page is a general page of the repository with no specific information. The second page displays the folder structure of the repository and contains a file called `mint integer overflow.md` within the `HYIPToken` folder. However, it does not contain the contents of this file nor any vulnerability details.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I cannot confirm if this content relates to CVE-2018-13722 or any other vulnerability.
