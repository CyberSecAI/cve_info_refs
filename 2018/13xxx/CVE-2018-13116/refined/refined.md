The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in ZZCMS version 8.3, specifically in the `user/del.php` file.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application uses `addslashes` for input filtering, which is insufficient to prevent SQL injection. The vulnerability lies in the way the `tablename` parameter is handled in a SQL query within `user/del.php`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The `tablename` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection because it is not properly sanitized. Specifically, the vulnerability can be exploited by using a back apostrophe to close the existing one and inject malicious SQL code.
- **Insufficient Input Filtering:** The use of `addslashes` is inadequate to prevent SQL injection, highlighting a flaw in the input sanitization logic.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    - **Data exfiltration:** Access and extraction of sensitive data, such as user credentials (admin passwords).
    - **Data modification:** Modification or deletion of data in the database.
    - **Privilege escalation:**  Potentially gaining higher privileges within the application.
- In the specific example, the attacker can use `SELECT` statements with `delay` to inject and retrieve the admin password.

**Attack vectors:**
- The `tablename` parameter in the `user/del.php` script is the injection point.
- The attacker manipulates the `tablename` parameter in the request by injecting malicious SQL code within back apostrophes.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the `user/del.php` script.
- The attacker needs to know that the application uses the `zzcms_ask` table for this specific injection point, meaning that the table must not be empty to achieve exploitation.
- The attacker needs to be able to observe the impact of the delay (if using a time-based injection technique) or observe the data returned (if using a union based technique).
