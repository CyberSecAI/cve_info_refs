"Founded in 1995, ADB initially focused on developing and marketing software
for digital TV processors and expanded its business to the design and
manufacture of digital TV equipment in 1997. The company sold its first set-top
box in 1997 and since then has been delivering a number of set-top boxes, and
Gateway devices, together with advanced software platforms. ADB has sold over
60 million devices worldwide to cable, satellite, IPTV and broadband operators.
ADB employs over 500 people, of which 70% are in engineering functions."

Business recommendation:
------------------------
By exploiting the authorization bypass vulnerability on affected and unpatched
devices an attacker is able to gain access to settings that are otherwise
forbidden for the user, e.g. through strict settings set by the ISP. It is also
possible to manipulate settings to e.g. enable the telnet server for remote
access if it had been previously disabled by the ISP. The attacker needs some
user account, regardless of the permissions, for login, e.g. the default one
provided by the ISP or printed on the device can be used.

It is highly recommended by SEC Consult to perform a thorough security review
by security professionals for this platform. It is assumed that further critical
vulnerabilities exist within the firmware of this device.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Authorization bypass vulnerability (CVE-2018-13109)
Depending on the firmware version/feature-set of the ISP deploying the ADB
device, a standard user account may not have all settings enabled within
the web GUI.

An authenticated attacker is able to bypass those restrictions by adding a
second slash in front of the forbidden entry of the path in the URL.
It is possible to access forbidden entries within the first layer of the web
GUI, any further subsequent layers/paths (sub menus) were not possible to access
during testing but further exploitation can't be ruled out entirely.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Authorization bypass vulnerability (CVE-2018-13109)
Assume the following URL is blocked/forbidden within the web GUI settings:
<http://$IP/ui/dboard/settings/management/telnetserver>

Adding a second slash in front of the blocked entry "telnetserver" will enable
full access including write permissions to change settings:
<http://$IP/ui/dboard/settings/management//telnetserver>

This works for many other settings within the web GUI!

In our tests it was not possible to access subsequent layers, e.g.:
Assume that both the proxy menu and submenu "rtsp" settings are blocked,
a second slash will _not_ enable access to the RTSP settings:
<http://$IP/ui/dboard/settings/proxy//rtsp>

Nevertheless, it can't be ruled out that sub menus can be accessed too when
further deeper tests are being performed.

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The following devices & firmware have been tested which were the most recent
versions at the time of discovery:

The firmware versions depend on the ISP / customer of ADB and may vary!

ADB P.RG AV4202N - E_3.3.0, latest firmware version, depending on ISP
ADB DV 2210 - E_5.3.0, latest firmware version, depending on ISP
ADB VV 5522 - E_8.3.0, latest firmware version, depending on ISP
ADB VV 2220 - E_9.0.6, latest firmware version, depending on ISP
etc.

It has been confirmed by ADB that _all_ their ADB modems / gateways / routers
based on the Epicentro platform are affected by this vulnerability in all
firmware versions for all their customers (ISPs) at the time of identification
of the vulnerability _except_ those devices which have a custom UI developed
for the ISP.

Vendor contact timeline:
------------------------
2016-07-01: Contacting vendor ADB, sending encrypted advisory, asking about
            affected devices
2016-07-08: Receiving information about affected devices
2016-07 - 2017-04: Further coordination, waiting for firmware release,
            implementation & rollout phases for their customers
2018-07-04: Embargo lifted, public release of security advisory

Solution:
---------
The firmware versions depend on the ISP / customer of ADB and may vary!

Patch version:

ADB P.RG AV4202N >= E_3.3.2, firmware version depending on ISP
ADB DV2210 >= E_5.3.2, firmware version depending on ISP
ADB VV5522 >= E_8.3.2, firmware version depending on ISP
ADB VV2220 >= E_9.3.2, firmware version depending on ISP
etc.

Workaround:
-----------
Restrict access to the web interface and only allow trusted users.
Change any default/weak passwords to strong credentials.
Don't allow remote access to the web GUI via Internet.

It is highly recommended by SEC Consult to perform a thorough security review by security professionals for this platform. It is assumed that further critical vulnerabilities exist within the firmware of this device.

## Vulnerability Overview / Description

### 1) Authorization bypass vulnerability (CVE-2018-13109)

Depending on the firmware version/feature-set of the ISP deploying the ADB device, a standard user account may not have all settings enabled within the web GUI.

An authenticated attacker is able to bypass those restrictions by adding a second slash in front of the forbidden entry of the path in the URL. It is possible to access forbidden entries within the first layer of the web GUI, any further subsequent layers/paths (sub menus) were not possible to access during testing but further exploitation can’t be ruled out entirely.

## Proof Of Concept

### 1) Authorization bypass vulnerability (CVE-2018-13109)

Assume the following URL is blocked/forbidden within the web GUI settings:

***[$IP/ui/dboard/settings/management/telnetserver](http://$IP/ui/dboard/settings/management/telnetserver)***

 Adding a second slash in front of the blocked entry “telnetserver” will enable full access including write permissions to change settings:

***[$IP/ui/dboard/settings/management//telnetserver](http://$IP/ui/dboard/settings/management//telnetserver)***

This works for many other settings within the web GUI!

In our tests it was not possible to access subsequent layers, e.g.:
 Assume that both the proxy menu and submenu “rtsp” settings are blocked, a second slash will **not** enable access to the RTSP settings:

***[$IP/ui/dboard/settings/proxy//rtsp](http://$IP/ui/dboard/settings/proxy//rtsp)***

 Nevertheless, it can’t be ruled out that sub menus can be accessed too when further deeper tests are being performed.

second slash in front of the forbidden entry of the path in the URL.
It is possible to access forbidden entries within the first layer of the web
GUI, any further subsequent layers/paths (sub menus) were not possible to access
during testing but further exploitation can't be ruled out entirely.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Authorization bypass vulnerability (CVE-2018-13109)
Assume the following URL is blocked/forbidden within the web GUI settings:
http://$IP/ui/dboard/settings/management/telnetserver

Adding a second slash in front of the blocked entry "telnetserver" will enable
full access including write permissions to change settings:
http://$IP/ui/dboard/settings/management//telnetserver

This works for many other settings within the web GUI!

In our tests it was not possible to access subsequent layers, e.g.:
Assume that both the proxy menu and submenu "rtsp" settings are blocked,
a second slash will _not_ enable access to the RTSP settings:
http://$IP/ui/dboard/settings/proxy//rtsp

Nevertheless, it can't be ruled out that sub menus can be accessed too when
further deeper tests are being performed.

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The following devices & firmware have been tested which were the most recent
versions at the time of discovery:

The firmware versions depend on the ISP / customer of ADB and may vary!

ADB P.RG AV4202N - E_3.3.0, latest firmware version, depending on ISP
ADB DV 2210 - E_5.3.0, latest firmware version, depending on ISP
ADB VV 5522 - E_8.3.0, latest firmware version, depending on ISP
ADB VV 2220 - E_9.0.6, latest firmware version, depending on ISP
etc.

It has been confirmed by ADB that _all_ their ADB modems / gateways / routers
based on the Epicentro platform are affected by this vulnerability in all
firmware versions for all their customers (ISPs) at the time of identification
of the vulnerability _except_ those devices which have a custom UI developed
for the ISP.

Vendor contact timeline:
------------------------
2016-07-01: Contacting vendor ADB, sending encrypted advisory, asking about
affected devices
2016-07-08: Receiving information about affected devices
2016-07 - 2017-04: Further coordination, waiting for firmware release,
implementation & rollout phases for their customers
2018-07-04: Embargo lifted, public release of security advisory

Solution:
---------
The firmware versions depend on the ISP / customer of ADB and may vary!

Patch version:

ADB P.RG AV4202N >= E_3.3.2, firmware version depending on ISP
ADB DV2210 >= E_5.3.2, firmware version depending on ISP
ADB VV5522 >= E_8.3.2, firmware version depending on ISP
ADB VV2220 >= E_9.3.2, firmware version depending on ISP
etc.

Workaround:
-----------
Restrict access to the web interface and only allow trusted users.
Change any default/weak passwords to strong credentials.
Don't allow remote access to the web GUI via Internet.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
