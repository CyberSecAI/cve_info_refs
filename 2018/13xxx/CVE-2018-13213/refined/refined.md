        "Integer Overflow",
        "Lack of proper input validation"
      ],
      "impact": "A user selling tokens may receive no ETH in return due to the overflow, while their tokens are still transferred to the contract. This makes the token unsafe and allows the contract owner to set a high `sellPrice` leading to loss of funds for token holders.",

        "The contract owner setting a high `sellPrice` value."

      "weaknesses": [
