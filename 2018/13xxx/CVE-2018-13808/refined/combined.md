WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Disable the integrated web server. The web server is disabled in the default settings and its use is

optional. Use in a productive environment is discouraged.

• Restrict access to to the device to the internal or VPN network. Further restrict access to the web

interface (80/tcp) and to the telnet port (23/tcp) to trusted IP addresses if possible.

• Do not click on links from unknown sources.

• Fixes for CVE-2018-13808 have also been released in versions V2.5.2.7, V2.6.2.2, V2.7.2.1 and
V2.8 of CP 1616 and CP 1604: https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109768664

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

CP 1616 and CP 1604 are PCI/PCI-104 cards for high-performance connection of ﬁeld devices to
Industrial Ethernet with PROFINET.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.0
(CVSS v3.0) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.
