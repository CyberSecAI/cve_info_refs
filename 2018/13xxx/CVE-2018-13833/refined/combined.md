Hi,all.

I use **Clang 6.0 and AddressSanitizer** to build **cmft**, this [file](https://github.com/fouzhe/security/blob/master/cmft/down-reference.ktx) can cause stack buffer overflow when executing this command:

```
./cmftRelease --input ./down-reference.ktx --output0 1
```

This is the ASAN information:

```
==22471==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: stack-buffer-overflow on address 0x7ffdd8490e18 at pc 0x00000049eccc bp 0x7ffdd8490b60 sp 0x7ffdd8490310
WRITE of size 49152 at 0x7ffdd8490e18 thread T0
AddressSanitizer:DEADLYSIGNAL
AddressSanitizer: nested bug in the same thread, aborting.
```

This is the debug information:

I use **Clang 6.0 and AddressSanitizer** to build **cmft**, this [file](https://github.com/fouzhe/security/blob/master/cmft/down-reference.ktx) can cause stack buffer overflow when executing this command:
