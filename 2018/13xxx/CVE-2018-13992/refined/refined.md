The provided content is related to CVE-2018-13992.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the default configuration of the web interface (HTTP) of the Phoenix Contact FL SWITCH devices, which transmits user credentials in cleartext.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319): User credentials are transmitted unencrypted when using the default HTTP web UI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could intercept the cleartext user credentials being transmitted. This could lead to the following:
- **Compromised Credentials:** Attackers can obtain user names and passwords
- **Unauthorized Access:** Access to the switch

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: An attacker positioned on the network can sniff the traffic between a user's browser and the switch's web UI when it's using HTTP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access: The attacker must have the capability to monitor network traffic where the communication occurs. No special privileges are required for this attack.
- No user interaction is required from the victim.
- No prior authentication is necessary.
