The provided content is a webpage from a GitHub repository. It contains navigation menus, repository information, and file listings. One of the files listed is named `mint integer overflow.md`, located in the `BrianCoin` folder. There is also a reference to a file named `mint%20integer%20overflow.md` located in the `GEMCHAIN` folder. This file name suggests a potential integer overflow vulnerability related to a 'mint' function in the code.

However, without the content of the markdown files themselves, it is not possible to determine the root cause of the vulnerability, its impact, or the specific attack vector involved. Therefore, I cannot provide detailed information about CVE-2018-13659 from the given context.
