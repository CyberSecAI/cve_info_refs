  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2018-13982",
    "description": "Smarty 3.1.32 and below is vulnerable to a path traversal issue due to insufficient sanitization in Smarty templates. Attackers with control over Smarty templates can bypass trusted directory restrictions, enabling them to read arbitrary files accessible to the web server.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from inadequate sanitization in the `_realpath` function within the Smarty template engine, which does not properly resolve relative paths, allowing for path traversal.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Path Traversal",
       "Insufficient Sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server by using specially crafted Smarty templates. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive data, including configuration files and database credentials.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability can be exploited using the `{fetch}` tag in a Smarty template by supplying a crafted file path.",
       "An attacker needs to be able to control the Smarty template that is being rendered"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "The attacker must have control over the content of a Smarty template that is rendered by the application.",
       "No specific privileges are required, just control over a Smarty template."
    ],
      "additional_details": "The `Smarty_Security` class intended to restrict file access had a broken `_realpath` method that failed to prevent path traversal. The initial fix in 3.1.32 was incomplete, requiring further patches in subsequent versions."
