{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow in the `mintToken` function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `mintToken` function adds `mintedAmount` to the `balanceOf[target]` and `totalSupply` variables, both of which are defined as `uint256`. This allows an attacker to cause an integer overflow by minting a large amount of tokens. The integer overflow can reset the balance of the target address to zero.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The owner of the contract can control the balance of an arbitrary user. An attacker can mint a large amount of tokens to cause an integer overflow, resulting in the balance of the target user being reset to zero. This allows the attacker to arbitrarily manipulate the token balances.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited through the `mintToken` function, which can be called by the contract owner.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be the owner of the smart contract to call the `mintToken` function."
