{
  "CVE-2018-13311": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper input sanitization in the Samba username field allows for command injection.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Command Injection",
        "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary system commands can be executed on the router's operating system.",
    "Attack vectors": "By sending a POST request to `/boafrm/formDlna` with a crafted Samba username containing backticks `\`\`\`\``.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router's web interface. The attacker also needs to be authenticated, which is trivial due to the weak authentication mechanism."
