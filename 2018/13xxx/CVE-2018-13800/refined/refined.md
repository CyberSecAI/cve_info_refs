- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The web interface of the SIMATIC S7-1200 CPU family version 4 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability (CWE-352). The web interface does not properly validate requests, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of a legitimate user.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful attack could allow an attacker to trigger actions via the web interface that the legitimate user is authorized to perform. This includes reading or modifying parts of the device configuration.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is triggered by tricking an authenticated user into accessing a malicious link. This likely involves an attacker crafting a malicious request that is then executed by the victim's browser while they are authenticated to the PLC's web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious link and trick a legitimate user into clicking it while the user is authenticated to the web interface of the PLC. The attacker also needs to be able to induce the victim to visit the malicious link.
