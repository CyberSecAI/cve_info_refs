VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-13800

The web interface could allow a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack if an unsuspecting user is
tricked into accessing a malicious link.

Successful exploitation requires user interaction by a legitimate user, who must be authenticated to
the web interface. A successful attack could allow an attacker to trigger actions via the web interface
that the legitimate user is allowed to perform. This could allow the attacker to read or modify parts of
the device conﬁguration.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this vulnerability was known.
