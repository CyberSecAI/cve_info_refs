- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input. Specifically, when a user attempts to change their username, the username is not properly sanitized when it is rendered on the password.htm page, leading to arbitrary javascript execution.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary JavaScript execution within the context of the user's browser session when attempting to change their username on the password.htm page. This could lead to session hijacking, stealing of credentials, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - An attacker can set the user's username to a malicious javascript payload.
    - When the user attempts to change their password and visits `password.htm`, the malicious script will be executed by the user's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to set the user's username via the web interface. They do not require an authenticated session initially, as authentication checks are weak and time-based, with some requests not requiring any authentication.
