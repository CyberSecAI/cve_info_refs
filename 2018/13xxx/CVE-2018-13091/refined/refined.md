{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow in the `mintToken` function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `mintToken` function in the smart contract is vulnerable to an integer overflow. The `balanceOf[target]` and `mintedAmount` variables are defined as `uint256`. When adding them together, if the result exceeds the maximum value of `uint256`, an integer overflow will occur, causing the balance to wrap around.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker, who is the owner of the contract, can exploit the integer overflow to manipulate the token balances of any user. By repeatedly calling `mintToken` with a large value, the attacker can force a user's balance to overflow and become zero. Moreover, the owner could arbitrarily control the balance of any user, setting it to an arbitrary value through repeated minting and overflows.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the vulnerable `mintToken` function. An attacker needs to be the owner of the smart contract.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be the owner of the smart contract to be able to call the `mintToken` function."
