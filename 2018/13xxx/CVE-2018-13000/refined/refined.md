- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of input sanitization in the `FTP Link` element within the Private Message module of the AEF CMS. The editor allows insertion of links without proper sanitization, enabling injection of malicious script code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent redirects to malicious sources, and persistent manipulation of affected or connected application modules.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the `FTP Link` element in the private message editor. An attacker can insert malicious script code within the FTP link, which is then executed when a user views the message.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs a low-privileged user account on the AEF forum. The attacker needs to be able to compose and send private messages. Low user interaction is required as the victim only needs to view the message for the script to execute. The attack is application-side and remote.
