The provided content relates to CVE-2018-13325.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an integer overflow in the `_sell` function of the GROWCHAIN (GROW) smart contract. Specifically, the crafted `sellPrice` value allows for revenue overflow due to improper handling of calculations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Integer overflow in the `_sell` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can lead to revenue overflow, potentially allowing an attacker to gain more tokens/funds than they should receive during a sell operation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by manipulating the `sellPrice` value when calling the `_sell` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the smart contract and call the `_sell` function with a carefully crafted `sellPrice` value.
