{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the `mintToken` function due to unchecked addition of `mintedAmount` to `balanceOf[target]` and `totalSupply`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Lack of Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "The owner of the contract can arbitrarily mint tokens to any user and, by triggering an integer overflow, effectively set any user's balance to 0 or another controlled value. This allows the owner to control the token supply and user balances, potentially leading to financial manipulation and loss of funds.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Call to the `mintToken` function by the contract owner with carefully crafted `mintedAmount` values."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be the owner of the contract."
  }
