- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The integrated web server of affected devices allows injection of HTTP headers due to improper neutralization of CRLF sequences in HTTP headers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Response Splitting'). Specifically, the web server does not properly handle CRLF sequences in HTTP headers, allowing injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can perform a HTTP header injection attack. This could potentially be used for various purposes, such as modifying response headers and potentially redirecting users or performing other malicious actions, though no specific impact is detailed beyond the ability to inject headers.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed over the network (port 80/tcp and port 443/tcp). The vulnerability is triggered by a user clicking on a malicious link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the web server of the affected devices, and needs to trick a valid authenticated user into clicking a malicious link.
