- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper access control to a data point.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Lack of proper access control mechanisms allows unauthorized access to data points.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated remote attacker can escalate privileges, compromise the integrity and availability of the SIMATIC WinCC OA system.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access to port 5678/TCP of the SIMATIC WinCC OA V3.14 server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have network access to the affected server and requires no user privileges or user interaction.
