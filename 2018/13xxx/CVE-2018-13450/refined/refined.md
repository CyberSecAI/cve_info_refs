Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability fixed in the commit:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before being used in SQL queries. This allowed for SQL injection attacks, which could lead to unauthorized data access or modification. Specifically, the `$filter` parameter in the `select_thirdparty_list` function and `GETPOST` parameters were not being sanitized before being used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The code was vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to unsanitized user input being directly incorporated into SQL queries.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The code used `GETPOST` to get data from HTTP requests, and the data was not properly validated, which led to injection vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:

*   **Read sensitive data:** Access confidential information stored in the database.
*   **Modify data:** Alter or delete critical data, leading to data corruption or loss.
*   **Bypass authentication:** Gain unauthorized access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET/POST parameters:** Attackers could inject malicious SQL code via crafted GET or POST parameters in HTTP requests, as these parameters were used in SQL queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic understanding of SQL:** An attacker would need to understand SQL syntax and how to construct malicious SQL injection payloads.
*   **Ability to send HTTP requests:** Attackers would need to send crafted HTTP requests with malicious parameters to the vulnerable application.
*   **No special permissions required**: The vulnerability can be exploited through the standard user interface.

**Mitigation:**

The commit addresses the vulnerabilities through the following changes:

*   **Input Sanitization:** The `test_sql_and_script_inject` function is used to filter the `$filter` parameter in `select_thirdparty_list` function to remove SQL keywords and prevent SQL injection.
*   **Input Validation:** The `GETPOST` function was updated with a new parameter `type`. This parameter will allow specifying the type of input (e.g., int, alpha, aZ09), and the function will automatically filter the input accordingly.
*  **Filtering out SQL keywords**: The `test_sql_and_script_inject` function was updated to filter a larger set of SQL keywords.

**Files Modified:**

The following files were modified:

*   `htdocs/core/class/html.form.class.php`: Added sanitization of the filter parameter.
*   `htdocs/main.inc.php`: Improved `test_sql_and_script_inject` to filter more SQL keywords.
*   `htdocs/product/card.php`: Added input validation by specifying the type of parameters from `GETPOST`.
*   `htdocs/societe/ajax/company.php`: Called `select_thirdparty_list` with the additional filter parameter.

**Additional Notes:**

* The commit message states "FIX SQL Injections reported by mu shcor (ADLab of Venustech)", indicating the vulnerability was discovered by an external security researcher.

In summary, the commit addresses multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities by sanitizing input parameters and adding input validation, thus preventing malicious SQL code from being executed.
