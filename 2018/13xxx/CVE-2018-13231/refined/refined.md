The provided content relates to CVE-2018-13231.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Integer overflow in the `sell()` function of various Ethereum smart contracts. Specifically, the multiplication of `amount` and `sellPrice` can result in an overflow, causing the contract to send an incorrect (or zero) amount of ETH to the seller.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow: The multiplication `amount * sellPrice` is not checked for overflow.
- Lack of proper error handling:  The contract proceeds with the token transfer even if the ETH transfer fails (due to the overflow).
- The contracts use `throw` keyword instead of `revert()`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Loss of funds for users selling tokens: Users lose their tokens without receiving the expected amount of ETH.
- Unfair advantage for contract owners: The owner can set a very high `sellPrice` that results in an overflow, effectively allowing the owner to receive tokens without paying ETH in return.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by calling the `sell()` function with specific `amount` and a `sellPrice` that will cause an integer overflow during multiplication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a user of the vulnerable contract.
- The attacker needs to know the `sellPrice` (or have the ability to influence the contract owner to set a vulnerable `sellPrice`).
- The attacker needs to have a non-zero token balance to sell.

**Additional details:**
The provided document includes a list of many smart contracts that have similar issues. The document also explains that the vulnerability occurs when the result of `amount * sellPrice` exceeds the maximum value that `uint256` can hold. This makes the amount sent to the seller to be equal to 0.
