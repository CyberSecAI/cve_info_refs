The provided content is related to CVE-2018-13449. It includes a commit that addresses SQL injection vulnerabilities in Dolibarr.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input, particularly within SQL queries. The code was vulnerable to SQL injection through GET and POST parameters in several files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The code was susceptible to SQL injection vulnerabilities due to the lack of proper input sanitization before incorporating user-supplied data into SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to:
- Execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database.
- Potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- Modify or delete data.
- Possibly compromise the entire application and the underlying server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious GET and POST parameters: Attackers could inject malicious SQL code through the GET and POST parameters of various web pages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable Dolibarr instance.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated, as the injection points are in publicly accessible parts of the application.

**Specific Details from the Commit:**

The commit `36402c2` addresses SQL injection issues reported by mu shcor (ADLab of Venustech) by implementing input validation:

- `htdocs/core/class/html.form.class.php`:  The `select_thirdparty_list` function now uses `test_sql_and_script_inject` to sanitize the `$filter` parameter.

- `htdocs/main.inc.php`:  The `test_sql_and_script_inject` function has been modified to include a more restrictive filter when the type is set to 3, to filter for SQL keywords such as "select", "update", "delete", "replace", "group by", "concat", "count", and "from". It also has added checks to prevent usage of function "user()" that returns database login, and information_schema database.

- `htdocs/product/card.php`: GET parameters are sanitized using 'alpha', 'int', 'aZ09' filters, preventing script injection.

- `htdocs/societe/ajax/company.php`: The `select_thirdparty_list` function is called to sanitize input.
