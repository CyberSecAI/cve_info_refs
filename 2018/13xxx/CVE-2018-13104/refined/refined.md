Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2018-13104:

**Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities in OX App Suite**

The provided document details multiple XSS vulnerabilities within the OX App Suite, all of which are assigned the same CVE ID: CVE-2018-13104. These vulnerabilities occur in different components (frontend and backend) and are triggered via different attack vectors.

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root Cause:**  Attachment file names in emails are not properly sanitized, allowing injection of script code when a user mouses over the attachment.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization of attachment filenames.
*   **Impact:** Malicious script code execution within the user's context, potentially leading to session hijacking or unwanted actions within the web interface (sending mail, deleting data, etc.).
*   **Attack Vector:** Crafted multipart HTML email with a malicious filename in the attachment.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to send crafted emails to the victim.
*   **Vulnerable Component:** Frontend.
*  **Affected Versions:** 7.10.0
*   **Fixed Version:** 7.10.0-rev13
*   **Proof of Concept:**
    ```
    Content-Type: image/svg+xml; name="<u onmouseover=alert(1)>w"
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
    Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="<u onmouseover=alert(1)>w"
    ```

**Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Root Cause:** File names of attachments within PIM objects (appointments, contacts, tasks) are not properly sanitized, allowing script code injection.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization of attachment filenames in PIM objects.
*   **Impact:** Malicious script code execution within the user's context, potentially leading to session hijacking or unwanted actions within the web interface.
*   **Attack Vector:** Creation of PIM objects with attachments containing malicious file names.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to create and share PIM objects with the victim, requiring a trust relationship between users or both being provisioned to the same context.
*   **Vulnerable Component:** Frontend.
*   **Affected Versions:** 7.10.0 and earlier
*   **Fixed Versions:** 7.10.0-rev13, 7.8.4-rev40, 7.8.3-rev44, 7.6.3-rev34
*   **Proof of Concept:**
    ```
    "><img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>.jpg
    ```

**Vulnerability 3:**

*   **Root Cause:** Specific URL parameters bypass the intended handling of potentially malicious files, causing them to be executed instead of downloaded.
*   **Weakness:** Improper handling of URL parameters related to content disposition, allowing client-side parameters to override server-side defaults
*   **Impact:** Malicious script code execution within the user's context.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Uploading a malicious HTML file, modifying its type, and creating a link with the `content_disposition=inline` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**  Ability to upload files and share links within the system. Requires user interaction (clicking the link).
*  **Vulnerable Component:** Backend
*   **Affected Versions:** 7.8.4 and earlier
*   **Fixed Versions:** 7.8.4-rev39, 7.8.3-rev50, 7.6.3-rev41
*   **Proof of Concept:**
    ```
    https://example.com/appsuite/api/files/html-xml?action=document&folder=10&id=10%2F348&content_disposition=inline
    ```

**Vulnerability 4:**

*   **Root Cause:**  Malicious script code within emails added to the Portal is executed.
*  **Weakness:** Improper "unescaping" of mail content within the frontend.
*   **Impact:**  Persistent XSS vulnerability, allowing malicious script code to be executed.
*   **Attack Vector:** Crafting an email containing malicious script code and having a user add that email to the portal.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**  Ability to send emails to the victim who will then add the email to the portal.
*  **Vulnerable Component:** Frontend
*   **Affected Versions:** 7.8.4
*  **Fixed Version:** 7.8.4-rev40
*   **Proof of Concept:**
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
    </head>
    <body>
    <p style="" class="default-style">&#60;img src=&#34;x&#34; onerror=&#34;alert(document.cookie);&#34;&#62;</p>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

**Summary of Vulnerabilities:**

In summary, CVE-2018-13104 encompasses multiple XSS vulnerabilities stemming from improper input sanitization and handling of file names and content within the OX App Suite. Attack vectors range from crafted emails to maliciously named attachments and specially crafted URLs. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows attackers to execute arbitrary script code within the user's context, potentially leading to session hijacking or other unauthorized actions.
