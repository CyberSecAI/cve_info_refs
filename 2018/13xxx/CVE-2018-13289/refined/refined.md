- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Information exposure vulnerability in `SYNO.FolderSharing.List` in Synology Router Manager (SRM).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information. This is due to insufficient access controls or improper handling of the `folder_path` or `real_path` parameters.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can obtain sensitive information from the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely via network requests by manipulating the `folder_path` or `real_path` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability, only network access to the vulnerable device.
