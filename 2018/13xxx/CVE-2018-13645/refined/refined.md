  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2018-13645",
      "type": "Integer Overflow",
       "root_cause": "The vulnerability is triggered by an integer overflow in the mint function of the smart contract. The `safeAdd` function is used to increase the supply by the requested mint amount. If this results in an overflow, the supply will wrap around, reducing the total supply.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Integer Overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can mint a large number of tokens, causing an integer overflow and resulting in a reduction of the total token supply. This can lead to a denial of service or unexpected behavior for the users of the contract.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Calling the mint function with a large input value, causing the supply to exceed the maximum representable value."
       ],
      "required_capabilities": [
        "Ability to interact with the smart contract's mint function"
      ],
      "more_info": "The github content reveals the vulnerability is an integer overflow in the mint function."
