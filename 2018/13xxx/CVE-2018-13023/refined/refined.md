The provided content relates to CVE-2018-13023.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation and sanitization of URL parameters within the `/cgi-bin/luci/;stok=<stok>/api/misns/wifi_access` endpoint. These parameters are passed directly to a shell command without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command Injection: The application fails to prevent attackers from injecting arbitrary shell commands due to inadequate input validation/sanitization of URL parameters such as `sns`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary command execution: By injecting malicious commands, an attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the router with root privileges. This can lead to complete compromise of the device, allowing for data exfiltration, installation of malware, or denial-of-service attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request to `/cgi-bin/luci/;stok=<stok>/api/misns/wifi_access`.
- Malicious commands are injected via URL parameters, specifically the `sns` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the router to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker needs to know a valid `stok` token.
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint.
