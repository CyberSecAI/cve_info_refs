- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A DLL hijacking vulnerability exists within the SIEMENS TD Keypad Designer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software is vulnerable to DLL hijacking, which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code by placing a malicious DLL in a location where the application will load it.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute code with the same permissions as the user running the TD Keypad Designer, potentially escalating their privileges on the system and gaining control.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have write access to the directory containing the TD project file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have write access to the directory containing the TD project file, and a legitimate user must open the TD project for the attack to be exploited. The attacker needs lower privileges than the victim user.
