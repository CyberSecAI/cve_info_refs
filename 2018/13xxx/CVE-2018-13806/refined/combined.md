individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-13806

A DLL hijacking vulnerability exists in all versions of SIEMENS TD Keypad Designer which could allow
an attacker to execute code with the permission of the user running TD Designer.

The attacker must have write access to the directory containing the TD project ﬁle in order to exploit
the vulnerability. A legitimate user with higher privileges than the attacker must open the TD project in
order for this vulnerability to be exploited.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.
