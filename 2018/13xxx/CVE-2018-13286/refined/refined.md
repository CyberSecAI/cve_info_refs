- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect default permissions on the `synouser.conf` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `synouser.conf` file is world-readable, which it should not be.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote authenticated users can obtain sensitive information by reading the world-readable configuration file.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack, where an authenticated user accesses the affected system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a remote user with valid credentials on the affected Synology Diskstation Manager (DSM) system.
