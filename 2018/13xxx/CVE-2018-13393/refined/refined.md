- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `convertCommentToAnswer` resource in Atlassian Confluence Questions lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can trick a user into unintentionally converting a comment into an answer.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker can craft a malicious link or website that, when accessed by a logged-in Confluence user, will trigger the vulnerable `convertCommentToAnswer` resource and convert a comment into an answer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to convince a logged-in Confluence user to visit the malicious link or website.
