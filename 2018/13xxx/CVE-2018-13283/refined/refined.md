- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of administrator control over security vulnerability in `client.cgi`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows for man-in-the-middle attacks through manipulation of the (1) `command`, (2) `hostname`, or (3) `port` parameters.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can conduct man-in-the-middle attacks, potentially intercepting and manipulating communications between the client and the server. This could lead to information disclosure, data tampering, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attackers can exploit the vulnerability by manipulating the `command`, `hostname`, or `port` parameters of the `client.cgi` script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the client and the server, and also requires user interaction (UI:R).
