Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-13983

**Description:** The vulnerability is a combination of reflected and stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issues within ImpressCMS version 1.3.10.

**Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Reflected XSS:**  The application reflects unsanitized input in the following files during the installation process:
    *   `install/index.php`
    *   `install/page_langselect.php`
    *   `install/page_modcheck.php`
    *   `install/page_pathsettings.php`
    *  `install/page_start.php`
    The vulnerable parameter is the URI (full URL).
*   **Stored XSS:** The application stores unsanitized input in `install/page_pathsettings.php` via the following POST parameters:
    *   `TRUST_PATH`
    *   `ROOT_PATH`

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject and execute malicious JavaScript code within the context of a victim's browser. This could lead to:

*   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
*   **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive information displayed on the page or submitting requests on behalf of the user.
*   **Phishing:** Redirecting the victim to a malicious site disguised as the legitimate application.
*   **Defacement:** Modifying the appearance of the web page, disrupting the user experience.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Delivering malware to the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Reflected XSS:** The attacker would need to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload and trick a user into clicking on it. This is usually achieved through social engineering tactics.
*   **Stored XSS:** The attacker would inject the malicious payload through the vulnerable POST parameters of `install/page_pathsettings.php`. Once stored, the XSS payload will be executed when an administrative user accesses a page where the stored values are displayed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Reflected XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to convince a user to click on a crafted link containing the malicious payload.
*  **Stored XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to submit a malicious payload through the installation form in order to have it stored. The attacker does not need any authenticated access.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was identified by Netsparker (now Invicti).
*   The vulnerability is rated as high severity.
*   The issue has been fixed by the vendor.
