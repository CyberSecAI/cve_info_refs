The provided content contains information about multiple vulnerabilities in Open-Xchange App Suite, including CVE-2018-13103.

**CVE-2018-13103:**

*   **Root Cause:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities exist due to insufficient input validation and sanitization when processing external references in vcards and handling IP addresses.
*   **Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SSRF via vCard:**  When importing a vCard, the application would follow HTTP redirects for the "PHOTO" attribute, even to local or internal network addresses. This allows attackers to force redirects to internal hosts.
    *   **SSRF via IP Address Circumvention:** The application could be tricked into accessing blocked IP addresses by using octal or hexadecimal representations of the IP address, bypassing blacklists.
*  **Impact:**
    *   Port scanning and host discovery on the internal network.
    *   Gathering information about the target system and infrastructure, potentially leading to further attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **vCard SSRF:**  Craft a malicious vCard file with a remote "PHOTO" attribute that redirects to internal hosts. Upload the crafted vCard.
    *   **IP Address SSRF:** Create content with external references using octal or hexadecimal representations of IP addresses to circumvent the IP address black list.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **vCard SSRF:** Requires the ability to upload files to the App Suite.
    *   **IP Address SSRF:** Requires the ability to supply external references, such as RSS feeds.
    *   Both require a low privilege account or access as an authenticated user.
