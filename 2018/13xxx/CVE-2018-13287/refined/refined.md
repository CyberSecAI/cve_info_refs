- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect default permissions on the `synouser.conf` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The `synouser.conf` file is world-readable, leading to sensitive information disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote authenticated users can obtain sensitive information by reading the world-readable configuration file.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Requires a remote authenticated user with network access to the vulnerable SRM instance.
