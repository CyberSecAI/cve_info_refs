The provided content is related to CVE-2018-13022.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper handling of malformed requests to the `/misystem` API, which generates a 404 error containing the request URL reflected in the error body. The response is served as `text/plain` but lacks the `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header, allowing some browsers to interpret it as HTML.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Lack of `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header.
- Unsanitized user input in the URL which is reflected back in the error message

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when they access the crafted URL. This could lead to various malicious actions, like session hijacking, redirecting to malicious sites, etc.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious URL crafted to include JavaScript payload in the request path, which is then reflected in the error response.
- The attacker needs to convince the victim to open the malicious crafted link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to lure the victim into clicking on a maliciously crafted URL. No authentication required.
