Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization or encoding when displaying the name of a saved filter within the two-dimensional filter statistics gadget on a Jira dashboard. This allows the injection of malicious HTML or JavaScript code.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the dashboard
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Execution of malicious scripts within the context of the victim's browser
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the name of a saved filter. If an attacker can create or manipulate a saved filter's name to include malicious code, this code will be executed when the filter's name is displayed within the two-dimensional filter statistics gadget.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a saved filter's name. This could be achieved by having appropriate permissions or exploiting another vulnerability that allows filter manipulation. The attacker also needs a user to view the malicious filter on a Jira dashboard.

This information aligns with the official CVE description of a XSS vulnerability in the two-dimensional filter statistics gadget on a Jira dashboard due to unsanitized filter names.
