### Description

The two-dimensional filter statistics gadget in Atlassian Jira before version 7.6.10, from version 7.7.0 before version 7.12.4, and from version 7.13.0 before version 7.13.1 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript via a cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the name of a saved filter when displayed on a Jira dashboard.
