Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-13784:

**Vulnerability Description:**

The core vulnerability lies in PrestaShop's cookie encryption mechanism, specifically within versions prior to 1.6.1.20 and 1.7.3.4. It's due to the use of a weak encryption scheme that is susceptible to padding oracle attacks.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is the use of AES in CBC mode without proper integrity checks (MAC), allowing an attacker to manipulate the ciphertext and, through a padding oracle attack, decrypt and potentially modify the cookie content. In older versions, a similar issue was present with Blowfish, although this was later removed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Padding Oracle:** The application doesn't properly verify the padding of the encrypted cookie, allowing an attacker to test different paddings and decrypt the cookie content byte by byte.
*   **Lack of Integrity Check:** There is no MAC (Message Authentication Code) to verify the integrity of the encrypted cookie, making it vulnerable to tampering.
*   **Weak Encryption Practices:** The usage of `mcrypt_*` functions in a way that is not secure, and the initial usage of Blowfish also contribute to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** By manipulating a user's cookie (employee or customer), an attacker can potentially gain access to admin accounts or other user accounts.
*   **Data Exposure:** Attackers can read sensitive information stored in the cookies like passwords, email, cart ids, etc.
*   **Account Takeover:** The attacker can modify cookies to impersonate other users, gaining full access to their accounts, with the possibility of escalating to admin accounts.
*   **Back Office Access:** An attacker can obtain a valid employee cookie, which enables them to access the back office if a customer has the same password as an employee.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Padding Oracle Attack:** The attack exploits the server's response to manipulated cookies, specifically whether the padding is valid or not.
*   **Cookie Manipulation:** Attackers modify the encrypted cookie by adding or modifying parts to decrypt the cookie content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the PrestaShop application.
*   **Cookie Observation:** The attacker requires to intercept or obtain a valid cookie from the targeted PrestaShop instance.
*   **Programming/Scripting:** The attacker needs the ability to perform the padding oracle attack. The provided exploit utilizes Python for this purpose.
*   **Knowledge of Application Internals:** While not strictly required, knowledge of the application's cookie structure can help in targeting specific data within cookies.

**Additional Information from Content:**

*   The provided exploit code in Python details how a padding oracle attack is performed against the AES-CBC encrypted cookie. It describes the process of reading, decrypting, and manipulating cookies to escalate privileges.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in PrestaShop versions 1.6.1.20 and 1.7.3.4 by using Encrypt-to-MAC and MAC-to-Decrypt approach and implementing proper PKCS#7 padding, addressing the core weaknesses.
*   The `crc_xor.c` file is used to calculate a correction block which does not change the cookie's checksum after being added.
*   The Github content shows the commits fixing the vulnerabilities which involve adding a signature to the encrypted cookie, improving the IV usage and implementing PKCS#7 padding.

In summary, the vulnerability is a serious flaw in PrestaShop's cookie encryption that allows for privilege escalation through padding oracle attacks. The provided exploit demonstrates the feasibility and potential impact of this vulnerability.
