The provided content is mostly navigation menus and does not contain any specific information about CVE-2018-13561. It does point to a repository that *might* contain relevant files, namely `ETH033/mint integer overflow.md` and `ETH033/sell integer overflow.md`, but the content of those files is not included. Thus, I cannot verify if the content is related to the CVE.
