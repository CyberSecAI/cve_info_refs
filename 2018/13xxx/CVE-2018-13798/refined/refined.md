- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to how the web server of the affected SICAM A8000 RTU series devices handles specially crafted network packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The web server is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to insufficient handling of specific network packets.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition, rendering the web server unavailable. A system reboot is required to restore the web service. This impacts the availability of the web server.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed by sending specially crafted network packets to the web server on ports 80/TCP or 443/TCP.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker requires network access to the affected systems on ports 80/TCP or 443/TCP. No system privileges or user interaction is required. Exploit code is publicly available.
