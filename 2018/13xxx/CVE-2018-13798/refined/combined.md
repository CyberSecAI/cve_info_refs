WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Limit access to the web server on port 80/TCP and 443/TCP with an external ﬁrewall.

• Apply a Defence-in-Depth strategy.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate
mechanisms (e.g. ﬁrewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to conﬁgure the environment according to
our operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.0
(CVSS v3.0) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-13798

Specially crafted network packets sent to port 80/TCP or 443/TCP could allow an unauthenticated
remote attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service condition of the web server.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to the affected
systems on port 80/TCP or 443/TCP. Successful exploitation requires no system privileges and no
user interaction. An attacker could use the vulnerability to compromise availability of the web server. A
system reboot is required to recover the web service of the device.

At the time of advisory update, exploit code for this security vulnerability is public.
