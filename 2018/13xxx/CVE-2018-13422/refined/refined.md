The provided content discusses a security fix for the `tcexam` project, specifically addressing two Reflected XSS vulnerabilities. This content is related to a security vulnerability, but since there is no specific information from the CVE description to compare against, the connection to CVE-2018-13422 is unknown. However, given the context of the content, it is likely related.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Two Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities were identified by Netsparker. These vulnerabilities stem from the lack of proper input sanitization.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected XSS vulnerabilities due to unsanitized input fields such as `ff_*` and `xl_*`.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of these XSS vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application that could be executed in the context of a victim's browser. This can result in session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
*  **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious scripts into vulnerable input fields, such as `ff_*` and `xl_*` parameters, which are then reflected back to the user without proper sanitization. The specific method of injecting scripts in the fields is not described in the text, but it is generally done by crafting malicious URLs or forms.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to craft a malicious input or URL containing the malicious script that would be reflected back by the vulnerable application. This typically involves convincing a user to click on a malicious link or to submit a crafted form.

The fix includes:
*   Hardcoding values for "ff\_required" and "ff\_required\_labels"
*   Escaping (sanitizing) "ff\_*" and "xl\_*" fields
*   Defining a constant for EMAIL Regular Expression pattern
*   Using form functions in `tce_edit_rating.php`

This information provides more detail than a basic CVE description and includes information about the specific fields vulnerable, the specific type of vulnerability, and the steps taken to mitigate the vulnerability.
