- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Sending a large number of specially crafted packets to the PLC can cause a denial-of-service condition on the network stack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion') (CWE-400). The PLC's network stack is unable to handle a large influx of specially crafted packets, leading to resource exhaustion.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The PLC loses its ability to communicate over the network, causing a denial-of-service condition which compromises the availability of the network connectivity.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access to the affected PLC.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires network access to the affected PLC. No special privileges or user interaction are needed.
