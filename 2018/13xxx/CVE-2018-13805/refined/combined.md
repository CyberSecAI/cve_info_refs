WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict network access to affected devices

• Apply cell-protection concept

• Apply defense-in-depth

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Products of the SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU family have been designed for discrete and continuous control in
industrial environments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries worldwide.

SIMATIC S7-1500 Software Controller is a SIMATIC software controller for PC-based automation solutions.

The SIMATIC ET 200SP Open Controller is a PC-based version of the SIMATIC S7-1500 Controller
including optional visualization in combination with central I/Os in a compact device.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-13805

An attacker can cause a denial-of-service condition on the network stack by sending a large number
of specially crafted packets to the PLC. The PLC will lose its ability to communicate over the network.

This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to the affected systems.
Successful exploitation requires no privileges and no user interaction. An attacker could use this
vulnerability to compromise availability of the network connectivity.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this vulnerability was known.
