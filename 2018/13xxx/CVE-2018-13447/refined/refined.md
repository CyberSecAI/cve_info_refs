The provided content is related to CVE-2018-13447. It shows a commit that addresses SQL injection vulnerabilities in Dolibarr.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries. Specifically, the `filter` parameter in the `select_thirdparty_list` function and various `GETPOST` parameters were not being properly sanitized, leading to potential SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of data.

**Attack vectors:**
- By manipulating the `filter` parameter passed to the `select_thirdparty_list` function.
- By manipulating the `GETPOST` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious SQL code through the vulnerable input fields or parameters.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the application via web interface.

**Details from the provided content:**
- The commit includes changes to `html.form.class.php`, `main.inc.php`, `card.php`, and `company.php`.
- In `html.form.class.php`, the `test_sql_and_script_inject` function is used to sanitize the `filter` parameter.
- In `main.inc.php`, the `test_sql_and_script_inject` function is enhanced to check for more SQL injection patterns.
- In `card.php`, `GETPOST` parameters are sanitized using `alpha`, `int`, `aZ09` to avoid SQL injections.
- In `company.php`, the `select_thirdparty_list` function is called with the sanitized input.

These changes indicate that the primary goal of this commit is to fix SQL injection vulnerabilities by sanitizing user input and filtering potentially malicious SQL keywords.
