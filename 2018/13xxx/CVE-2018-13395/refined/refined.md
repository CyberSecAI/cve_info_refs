- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the epic colour field during issue movement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code, potentially leading to malicious actions on the client-side, such as data theft, session hijacking, or phishing attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is the "epic colour" field of an issue while that issue is being moved.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to manipulate the epic color field during issue movement. The specific access level is not mentioned but it requires the user to have sufficient privileges to interact with the epic color field of an issue when moving it.
