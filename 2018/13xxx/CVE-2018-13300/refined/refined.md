Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-13300:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `handle_eac3` function within `libavformat/movenc.c`.
- An improper argument, specifically an `AVCodecParameters` structure, is passed to the `avpriv_request_sample` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Out-of-array read:** The improper argument leads to an out-of-bounds read during the processing of a crafted AVI file when converting it to MPEG4.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The out-of-array read can cause the application to crash, leading to a denial of service.
- **Potential Information Disclosure:** The out-of-bounds read could potentially expose sensitive information from memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious AVI file:** The vulnerability is triggered when a specially crafted AVI file is processed using FFmpeg.
- **File conversion:** The attack occurs during the conversion process of the malicious AVI file to MPEG4.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious AVI file to a system running a vulnerable version of FFmpeg.
- The attacker requires user interaction as the user needs to process the malicious file with the vulnerable software.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability affects FFmpeg versions 3.2 and 4.0.1.
- The fix involves modifying the `handle_eac3` function to avoid passing the `AVCodecParameters` to the `avpriv_request_sample`.
- The vulnerability was discovered using AFLSmart.
- The fix is present in commits `95556e2` and `e6d3fd9`.
- The issue is related to handling multiple independent substreams in the EAC3 codec.
- The vulnerability is classified as "High" severity with a CVSS score of 8.1.
- The vulnerability has a CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) classification.
