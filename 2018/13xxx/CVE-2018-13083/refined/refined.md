{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow in the `mintToken` function due to using unchecked arithmetic operations with `uint256` variables for tracking token balances and total supply.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Integer overflow in the `balanceOf` mapping and `totalSupply` variable.",
    "Unrestricted minting of tokens by the contract owner."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker (owner of the contract) can arbitrarily manipulate the token balances of any user by causing an integer overflow. They can effectively reduce or set user balances to any value, potentially to 0, regardless of previous transactions. This could lead to loss of funds for the affected users and undermine the token's value and credibility.",
  "Attack vectors": "The `mintToken` function is the vulnerable point of entry.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be the owner of the contract or have control over the contract's owner to invoke the `mintToken` function."
