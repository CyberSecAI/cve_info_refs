The provided content is mostly boilerplate HTML for GitHub pages and does not contain any information about CVE-2018-13612. However, one of the HTML pages contains a link to a markdown file named "mint integer overflow.md" located in the Robincoin directory. This file might contain the vulnerability details.

Based on the file name "mint integer overflow.md" and the directory structure, the issue is likely related to an integer overflow vulnerability within a mint function of a smart contract named Robincoin, which could cause a large number of tokens to be minted by a malicious user. This would align with typical smart contract vulnerabilities.

Given that the content does not contain vulnerability details other than the file name, the response is:
NOINFO
