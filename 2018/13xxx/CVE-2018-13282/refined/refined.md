- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Session fixation vulnerability in the SYNO.PhotoStation.Auth component of Synology Photo Station.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application does not properly regenerate or invalidate session identifiers upon login, allowing attackers to reuse a known session ID.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can hijack web sessions by using a predictable or obtained `PHPSESSID` parameter. This could lead to unauthorized access, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote network attack, specifically by manipulating the `PHPSESSID` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have knowledge of or be able to obtain a valid `PHPSESSID`. No special privileges or user interaction are required by the attacker other than manipulating the request.
