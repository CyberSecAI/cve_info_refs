All ADB broadband gateways / routers based on the Epicentro platform used by many telecommunication providers (ISPs) world-wide are affected by a privilege escalation vulnerability where attackers can gain access to the command line interface (CLI) if previously disabled by the ISP, escalate their privileges and perform further attacks.

Also see our other two advisories regarding critical ADB vulnerabilities as they have been split up for better readability:

## Vendor Description

*“ADB creates and delivers the right solutions that enable our customers to reduce integration and service delivery challenges to increase ARPU and reduce churn. We combine ADB know-how and products with those from a number of third party industry leaders to deliver complete solutions that benefit from collaborative thinking and best in class technologies.”*

Source: <https://www.adbglobal.com/about-adb/>

*“Founded in 1995, ADB initially focused on developing and marketing software for digital TV processors and expanded its business to the design and manufacture of digital TV equipment in 1997. The company sold its first set-top box in 1997 and since then has been delivering a number of set-top boxes, and Gateway devices, together with advanced software platforms. ADB has sold over 60 million devices worldwide to cable, satellite, IPTV and broadband operators. ADB employs over 500 people, of which 70% are in engineering functions.”*

## Business Recommendation

By exploiting the group manipulation vulnerability on affected and unpatched devices an attacker is able to gain access to the command line interface (CLI) if previously disabled by the ISP.

Depending on the feature-set of the CLI (ISP dependent) it is then possible to gain access to the whole configuration and manipulate settings in the web GUI and escalate privileges to highest access rights.

It is highly recommended by SEC Consult to perform a thorough security review by security professionals for this platform. It is assumed that further critical vulnerabilities exist within the firmware of this device.

## Vulnerability Overview/ Description

### 1) Privilege escalation via linux group manipulation (CVE-2018-13110)

An attacker with standard / low access rights within the web GUI is able to gain access to the CLI (if it has been previously disabled by the configuration) and escalate his privileges.

Depending on the CLI features it is possible to extract the whole configuration and manipulate settings or gain access to debug features of the device, e.g. via “debug”, “upgrade”, “upload” etc. commands in the CLI. Attackers can gain access to sensitive configuration data such as VoIP credentials or other information and manipulate any settings of the device.

## Proof Of Concept

### 1) Privilege escalation via linux group manipulation (CVE-2018-13110)

It is possible to manipulate the group name setting of “Storage users” and overwrite the local linux groups called “remoteaccess” or “localaccess” (in /etc/group) which define access to Telnet or SSH on the ADB devices. It may be possible to overwrite the “root” group as well but it may brick the device and the default user is already within the “root” group. Hence this attack has not been further tested.

The following steps describe the attack:

a) Add a new group called “localaccess” via the web GUI here:

***[$IP/ui/dboard/storage/storageusers](http://$IP/ui/dboard/storage/storageusers?backto=storage)***

This will generate the following new group in /etc/group. The original “localaccess” group will overwritten.

***localaccess:Storage Group:5001:***

b) Then delete this group via the web GUI again, the entry will be removed from /etc/group completely.

c) Afterwards, create the following new group name entry via the web GUI and add your user account (e.g. admin) which should have access to Telnet/SSH now:

***localaccess:x:20:root,admin,***

d) Now the admin user has been added to the “localaccess” group and the “admin” account is allowed to login via SSH or Telnet. Excerpt of new /etc/group:

***localaccess:x:20:root,admin,:Storage Group:5001:***

Further attacks on the CLI interface will not be described in detail within this advisory. It is possible to add new user accounts with highest access rights (“newuser” command) or upload the whole configuration to a remote FTP server (“upload” command). The available feature-set of the CLI depends on the firmware version. The XML configuration is encrypted, but can be easily decrypted with access to the firmware. Then it can be manipulated and uploaded to the device again (“upgrade” command) which allows privilege escalation by changing permissions or roles within this file.

## Vulnerable / Tested Versions

The following specific devices & firmware have been tested which were the most recent versions at the time of discovery:

The firmware versions depend on the ISP / customer of ADB and may vary!

* ADB P.RG AV4202N – E\_3.3.0, firmware version depending on ISP
* ADB DV 2210 – E\_5.3.0, firmware version depending on ISP
* ADB VV 5522 – E\_8.3.0, firmware version depending on ISP
* ADB VV 2220 – E\_9.0.6, firmware version depending on ISP
* etc.

It has been confirmed by ADB that **all** their ADB modems / gateways / routers based on the Epicentro platform are affected by this vulnerability in all firmware versions for all their customers (ISPs) at the time of identification of the vulnerability **except** those devices which have a custom UI developed for the ISP.

## Vendor Contact Timeline

| 2016-07-12: | Contacting vendor ADB, sending encrypted advisory, asking about affected devices |
| --- | --- |
| 2016-07 – 2017-04: | Further coordination, waiting for firmware release, implementation & rollout phases for their customers |
| 2018-07-04: | Embargo lifted, public release of security advisory |

## Solution

December 3, 2020

The firmware versions depend on the ISP / customer of ADB and may vary!

Patch version:

* ADB P.RG AV4202N >= E\_3.3.2, firmware version depending on ISP
* ADB DV2210 >= E\_5.3.2, firmware version depending on ISP
* ADB VV5522 >= E\_8.3.2, firmware version depending on ISP
* ADB VV2220 >= E\_9.3.2, firmware version depending on ISP
* etc.

## Workaround

Restrict access to the web interface and only allow trusted users.
 Change any default/weak passwords to strong credentials.
 Don’t allow remote access to the web GUI via Internet.

"Founded in 1995, ADB initially focused on developing and marketing software
for digital TV processors and expanded its business to the design and
manufacture of digital TV equipment in 1997. The company sold its first set-top
box in 1997 and since then has been delivering a number of set-top boxes, and
Gateway devices, together with advanced software platforms. ADB has sold over
60 million devices worldwide to cable, satellite, IPTV and broadband operators.
ADB employs over 500 people, of which 70% are in engineering functions."

Business recommendation:
------------------------
By exploiting the group manipulation vulnerability on affected and unpatched
devices an attacker is able to gain access to the command line interface (CLI)
if previously disabled by the ISP.

Depending on the feature-set of the CLI (ISP dependent) it is then possible to
gain access to the whole configuration and manipulate settings in the web GUI
and escalate privileges to highest access rights.

It is highly recommended by SEC Consult to perform a thorough security review
by security professionals for this platform. It is assumed that further critical
vulnerabilities exist within the firmware of this device.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Privilege escalation via linux group manipulation (CVE-2018-13110)
An attacker with standard / low access rights within the web GUI is able to
gain access to the CLI (if it has been previously disabled by the configuration)
and escalate his privileges.

Depending on the CLI features it is possible to extract the whole configuration
and manipulate settings or gain access to debug features of the device, e.g.
via "debug", "upgrade", "upload" etc. commands in the CLI.

Attackers can gain access to sensitive configuration data such as VoIP
credentials or other information and manipulate any settings of the device.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Privilege escalation via linux group manipulation (CVE-2018-13110)
It is possible to manipulate the group name setting of "Storage users" and
overwrite the local linux groups called "remoteaccess" or "localaccess" in
(in /etc/group) which define access to Telnet or SSH on the ADB devices.

It may be possible to overwrite the "root" group as well but it may brick the
device and the default user is already within the "root" group. Hence this
attack has not been further tested.

The following steps describe the attack:
a) Add a new group called "localaccess" via the web GUI here:
http://$IP/ui/dboard/storage/storageusers?backto=storage

This will generate the following new group in /etc/group. The original
"localaccess" group will overwritten.

localaccess:Storage Group:5001:

b) Then delete this group via the web GUI again, the entry will be removed
from /etc/group completely.

c) Afterwards, create the following new group name entry via the web GUI and
add your user account (e.g. admin) which should have access to Telnet/SSH
now:

localaccess:x:20:root,admin,

d) Now the admin user has been added to the "localaccess" group and the "admin"
account is allowed to login via SSH or Telnet. Excerpt of new /etc/group:

localaccess:x:20:root,admin,:Storage Group:5001:

Further attacks on the CLI interface will not be described in detail within
this advisory. It is possible to add new user accounts with highest access rights
("newuser" command) or upload the whole configuration to a remote FTP server
("upload" command). The available feature-set of the CLI depends on the firmware
version.
The XML configuration is encrypted, but can be easily decrypted with access to the
firmware. Then it can be manipulated and uploaded to the device again ("upgrade"
command) which allows privilege escalation by changing permissions or roles
within this file.

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The following specific devices & firmware have been tested which were the most
recent versions at the time of discovery:

The firmware versions depend on the ISP / customer of ADB and may vary!

ADB P.RG AV4202N - E_3.3.0, firmware version depending on ISP
ADB DV 2210 - E_5.3.0, firmware version depending on ISP
ADB VV 5522 - E_8.3.0, firmware version depending on ISP
ADB VV 2220 - E_9.0.6, firmware version depending on ISP
etc.

It has been confirmed by ADB that _all_ their ADB modems / gateways / routers
based on the Epicentro platform are affected by this vulnerability in all
firmware versions for all their customers (ISPs) at the time of identification
of the vulnerability _except_ those devices which have a custom UI developed
for the ISP.

Vendor contact timeline:
------------------------
2016-07-12: Contacting vendor ADB, sending encrypted advisory, asking about
affected devices
2016-07 - 2017-04: Further coordination, waiting for firmware release,
implementation & rollout phases for their customers
2018-07-04: Embargo lifted, public release of security advisory

Solution:
---------
The firmware versions depend on the ISP / customer of ADB and may vary!

Patch version:

ADB P.RG AV4202N >= E_3.3.2, firmware version depending on ISP
ADB DV2210 >= E_5.3.2, firmware version depending on ISP
ADB VV5522 >= E_8.3.2, firmware version depending on ISP
ADB VV2220 >= E_9.3.2, firmware version depending on ISP
etc.

Workaround:
-----------
Restrict access to the web interface and only allow trusted users.
Change any default/weak passwords to strong credentials.
Don't allow remote access to the web GUI via Internet.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
