{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper access control within the web interface allows manipulation of Linux group settings.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the ability to modify the 'Storage users' group name setting, which directly overwrites the definitions of 'remoteaccess' and 'localaccess' groups in the /etc/group file. This allows an attacker to grant themselves SSH/Telnet access by adding their user to the 'localaccess' group.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with low-level access can gain access to the device's CLI (Command Line Interface), which is normally restricted. Through the CLI, the attacker can extract sensitive configuration data such as VoIP credentials, manipulate device settings, and potentially escalate privileges to the highest access rights. Further exploitation via the CLI includes adding new users with high privileges, uploading configurations to a remote server, or manipulating the device's configuration through firmware updates.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the web GUI of the ADB broadband gateway. An attacker with access to the web interface can navigate to the 'Storage users' settings and manipulate group definitions.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires initial low-level access to the web GUI of the affected ADB broadband gateway. No special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability."
