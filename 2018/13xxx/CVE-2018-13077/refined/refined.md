The provided content describes a vulnerability in the `mintToken` function of the CTB token smart contract.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Integer overflow in the `mintToken` function. Specifically, the `balanceOf[target] += mintedAmount;` and `totalSupply += mintedAmount;` lines do not check for potential overflows when adding `mintedAmount` to the existing balances.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow: The use of `uint256` for token balances and total supply without overflow checks.
- Arbitrary minting: The `mintToken` function allows the contract owner to mint arbitrary amounts of tokens to any address.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Token balance manipulation: An attacker (the contract owner) can cause an integer overflow to reset any user's balance to zero or control the balance of any user to an arbitrary value.
- Inflated total supply: The `totalSupply` can also be inflated through the same overflow.

**Attack vectors:**
- The contract owner can directly call the vulnerable `mintToken` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be the owner of the smart contract to invoke `mintToken()`.
