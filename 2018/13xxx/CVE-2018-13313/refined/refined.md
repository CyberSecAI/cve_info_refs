Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-13313 and other related vulnerabilities:

**CVE-2018-13313: Admin Password returned in password.htm**

*   **Root Cause:** The TOTOLINK A3002RU router's `password.htm` page contains JavaScript code that stores the current administrator's password in plaintext within the `orgpassword` variable.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** The admin password is exposed in the HTML source code of the page.
    *   **Lack of Server-Side Validation:** The password is not validated on the server-side.
    *   **Insecure Storage:** Passwords should not be stored or transmitted in plaintext.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker with access to the router's web interface could easily view the source code of `password.htm` and obtain the administrator's password.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network Access:** An attacker on the same network as the router could access the web interface.
    *   **Local Access:** A user who has logged into the router's administration page can access the plaintext password.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to access the router's web interface.
    *   No authentication is required as long as someone has logged in recently (approx 5 mins) or none depending on the request.

**Additional Vulnerabilities in TOTOLINK A3002RU**

The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities, which can be grouped:

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**:
    *   CVE-2018-13312, CVE-2018-13308: XSS in `notice_gen.htm` via "Input your notice URL" and "User phrases button" fields respectively.
    *   CVE-2018-13309, CVE-2018-13310: XSS in `password.htm` via user's password and username fields.
    *   CVE-2018-13317: XSS via URL Filter, by adding a URL address containing an XSS payload.
*   **Command Injection (OS CMDi)**:
    *   CVE-2018-13311: OS CMDi via Samba username field.
    *  CVE-2018-13306: OS CMDi via FTP username field.
    *   CVE-2018-13307: OS CMDi via NTP server IP address field.
    *   CVE-2018-13314, CVE-2018-13316: OS CMDi in `formAliasIP` via `ipAddr` and `subnet` parameters, respectively.
*  **Other**
    *   CVE-2018-13315: Missing Server-side Validation of Current Password during Password Change.  Allows changing password without knowing the existing password.

**General Analysis of SOHOpelessly Broken 2.0**

The document details research into multiple SOHO devices, revealing widespread vulnerabilities including:

*   **Authentication and Authorization Bypasses:** Several devices had issues where authentication or authorization checks could be circumvented.
*   **Command Injection:** OS command injection vulnerabilities are common across the devices evaluated.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Many devices were vulnerable to XSS attacks.
*   **Insecure Storage of Data:** Some devices stored sensitive data in insecure ways.
*   **Lack of CSRF Protections:** Many devices lacked CSRF protections.
*   **Vulnerabilities in Custom Protocols:** Devices using custom protocols and APIs were found to have issues related to insecure authentication and lack of proper authorization.
*   **Reliance on Obscurity:** The security of some devices relied on obscurity rather than strong security mechanisms.

**Impact of Exploitation**

The vulnerabilities allow attackers to:

*   Gain complete control over the devices.
*   Execute arbitrary system commands with root privileges.
*   Access sensitive data stored on the device.
*   Pivot to other devices on the local network.
*   Install malware.
*   Denial of service
*   Bricking Devices

**General Attack Vectors**

*   **Local Network Access:** Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities if they are on the same local network as the targeted device.
*   **Remote Access (Internet):** Via port forwarding, vulnerable devices directly exposed to the internet are at risk.
*   **DNS Rebinding:** By tricking the browser, an attacker can circumvent the same-origin policy and interact with devices on the local network.
*   **Social engineering/phishing**: Victim is lured to a malicious website, causing their router to be attacked in the background.

**Required Attacker Capabilities**

*   Basic understanding of networking concepts.
*   Knowledge of HTTP requests and HTML.
*   Ability to craft malicious payloads.
*   Ability to access the targeted device on the network.

**Additional Details**

*   The research highlights that many IoT devices lack sufficient security controls.
*   Many vendors do not have proper vulnerability disclosure programs.
*   Even devices from well-known manufacturers have significant security flaws.
*   Many of the vulnerabilities could have been avoided by implementing basic security best practices, such as input sanitization and proper authentication/authorization mechanisms.

**Summary of Relevant Information**

The content provides significantly more detail than the typical CVE description.  It provides an in-depth analysis of the security flaws of multiple SOHO devices and demonstrates that many of these devices are vulnerable to remote exploitation. The specific instance of CVE-2018-13313 is described within the context of a broader set of vulnerabilities in the TOTOLINK A3002RU, where a plaintext password was found in javascript code.
