CVE-2018-13405
```

**Root cause of vulnerability**:
The vulnerability stems from a missing check in the `inode_init_owner()` function within the Linux kernel's `fs/inode.c` file. Specifically, the function does not properly clear the set-group-ID (SGID) bit on newly created non-directory files when the creating user is not a member of the directory's group.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
- Improper handling of the SGID bit for non-directory files in setgid directories.
-  A local user who is not a member of the group that owns a setgid directory can create files in the shared directory that also inherit that group ownership and sgid bit.

**Impact of exploitation**:
- A local user can create files with group ownership and setuid bit, granting them excessive permissions.
-  A local unprivileged user could gain elevated privileges on the system, by creating SGID files in locations that should not have that permission.
- Loss of data: Any outstanding disk writes to the NFS server will be lost.

**Attack vectors**:
Local user access to a setgid directory which they can write to but are not a group member of.

**Required attacker capabilities/position**:
-  The attacker must be a local user on the affected system.
-  The attacker needs write access to a directory that has the SGID bit set, while not being a member of the group that owns the directory.
