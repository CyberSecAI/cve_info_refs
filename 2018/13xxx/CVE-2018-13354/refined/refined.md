{
  "CVE-2018-13354": {
    "description": "The `/include/ajax/logtable.php` endpoint does not perform any checks on the userâ€™s authentication or authorization. Furthermore, the `Event` parameter is vulnerable to system command injection.",
    "root_cause": "The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `Event` parameter of the `/include/ajax/logtable.php` endpoint, allowing for command injection.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "System Command Injection",
      "Missing Authentication/Authorization"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary commands can be executed on the system as the root user.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a POST request to `/include/ajax/logtable.php` with a malicious payload in the `Event` parameter."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "No authentication or authorization is required. An attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable endpoint."
