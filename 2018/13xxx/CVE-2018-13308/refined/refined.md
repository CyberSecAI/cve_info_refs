The provided content is related to CVE-2018-13308.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The web application of the TOTOLINK A3002RU router does not properly sanitize user input in the "User phrases button" field in `notice_gen.htm`, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser when they visit the affected page. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or further exploitation.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker can set the "User phrases button" field to a XSS payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to access the router's web interface and modify the "User phrases button" field. This likely requires being on the same network as the router, or having some level of remote access.
