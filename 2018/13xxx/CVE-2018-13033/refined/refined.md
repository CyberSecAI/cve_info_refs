  "CVE-2018-13033": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2018-13033",
      "Description": "A flaw was found in The Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.30, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (excessive memory allocation and application crash) via a crafted ELF file. This can occur during execution of nm."
    },
    "Technical Details": {
      "Root Cause": "Uncontrolled resource consumption due to excessive memory allocation.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Uncontrolled resource consumption"
      ],
      "Impact": "Denial of service due to excessive memory allocation leading to application crash.",
      "Attack Vectors": [
        "Crafted ELF file"
      ],
      "Required Capabilities": [
        "Ability to entice a user to process the crafted file via `nm`."
      ],
       "Affected Component": "Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd) in GNU Binutils"
    },
     "Resolution": {
        "Patch": "https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=binutils-gdb.git;a=commitdiff;h=95a6d235661",
