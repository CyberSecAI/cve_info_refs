Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-13302:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper handling of frame types, specifically those other than `EAC3_FRAME_TYPE_INDEPENDENT`, that have multiple independent substreams in the `handle_eac3` function within the `libavformat/movenc.c` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-array access: The vulnerability is triggered when processing a crafted AVI file, leading to an attempt to access memory outside of the allocated array bounds.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The out-of-array access can cause the application to crash, leading to a denial of service.
- Potentially other unspecified impact: The vulnerability could potentially have further impacts beyond a denial of service, although these are not explicitly stated.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malformed AVI file: The vulnerability is triggered when a specially crafted AVI file is processed by FFmpeg.
- File conversion: The specific attack vector involves converting a crafted AVI file to MPEG4 format.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted AVI file to an application using the vulnerable FFmpeg library.
- The user must perform a file conversion using the vulnerable version of FFmpeg.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix for this vulnerability involves adding a check to ensure that frame types other than `EAC3_FRAME_TYPE_INDEPENDENT` have a supported substream ID. This prevents the out-of-bounds access.
- The vulnerability was found using AFLSmart by Thuan Pham, Marcel BÃ¶hme, Andrew Santosa and Alexandru Razvan Caciulescu.
- The vulnerability is rated as High severity with a CVSS v3 score of 8.8.
- The exploit probability is estimated as 0.331% within the next 30 days using the EPSS system.
