- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by the affected device not properly managing its connection pool, allowing an attacker to exhaust the available resources by opening a large number of connections.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient Resource Pool (CWE-410). The device fails to limit the number of TCP connections and lacks a mechanism to prevent resource exhaustion.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition. This prevents HMI or engineering access to the PLC over port 102/tcp, impacting the availability of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack. The attacker sends network packets to port 102/tcp of the affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send packets to port 102/tcp of the affected device. No user interaction or privileges are required for exploitation.
