SSA-584286: Denial-of-Service Vulnerability in SIMATIC S7-1200 CPU
and SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 5.3

2018-11-13

V1.2

SUMMARY

A vulnerability was identiﬁed in SIMATIC S7-1200 and S7-1500 CPUs that could allow an attacker to
cause a denial-of-service condition preventing HMI or engineering access to the PLC over port 102/tcp.

Siemens has released an update for the S7-1500 product and recommends that customers update to the
new version. Siemens is preparing a further update for the S7-1200 product and recommends speciﬁc
workarounds and mitigations until patches are available.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Protect network access to port 102/tcp of affected devices

• Apply cell-protection concept

• Apply defense-in-depth

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Products of the SIMATIC S7-1200 CPU family have been designed for discrete and continuous control in
industrial environments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries worldwide.

Products of the SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU family have been designed for discrete and continuous control in
industrial environments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries worldwide.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-13815

An attacker could exhaust the available connection pool of an affected device by opening a sufﬁcient
number of connections to the device.

Successful exploitation requires an attacker to be able to send packets to port 102/tcp of the affected
device. No user interaction and no user privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability. The
vulnerability, if exploited, could cause a Denial-of-Service condition impacting the availability of the
system.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this vulnerability was known.
