{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the `sell` function due to the multiplication of `amount` and `sellPrice` potentially resulting in a value of 0.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Users can lose their tokens without receiving any ether in return. The contract owner can manipulate `sellPrice` to cause this vulnerability, effectively stealing user tokens.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Manipulating `sellPrice` to a large value by contract owner."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Contract owner needs to set the sellPrice, and user needs to sell tokens."
