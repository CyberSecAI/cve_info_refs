- **Root cause of vulnerability:** During user creation, the new user's username is stored in a database, retrieved, and then passed as-is to a shell running the `pdbedit` command.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection via the username field.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary system commands via the username, potentially gaining a root shell, although character restrictions exist on the username itself.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed via the `User.create` method of the JSON RPC API, by sending a crafted username to the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** This attack initially requires administrator privileges, but the document notes that this can be bypassed by exploiting other vulnerabilities like the Authentication Bypass on JSONRPC API vulnerability (CVE-2018-13324).
