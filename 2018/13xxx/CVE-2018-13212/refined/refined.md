{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the sell() function due to multiplication of amount and sellPrice.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "When a user attempts to sell tokens back to the contract, and the sellPrice is set such that `amount * sellPrice` overflows, the product will become zero. As a result, the user loses their tokens and receives no ETH in return. The contract ends up holding the tokens.",
    "attack_vectors": "The contract owner can set a very high sellPrice value such that the multiplication `amount * sellPrice` will result in an integer overflow.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be the owner of the contract or have the ability to set the sellPrice. A user that holds tokens and attempts to sell them can trigger the vulnerability when an integer overflow occurs."
