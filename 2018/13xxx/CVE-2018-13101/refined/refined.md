Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-13101

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in the insecure implementation of a WCF (Windows Communication Foundation) endpoint in KioskSimpleService.exe. Specifically, the exposed methods within this endpoint lack proper access controls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure WCF Endpoint:** The WCF endpoint exposes methods that should not be accessible without proper authorization or restrictions.
- **Unrestricted Registry Access:** The exposed methods allow read and write access to the Windows registry.
- **Unrestricted Service Control:** The exposed methods allow control of Windows services.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can leverage these exposed methods to escalate their privileges on the system.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By manipulating the registry or controlling services, the attacker can execute attacker-controlled binaries.
- **Full System Compromise:** Successfully exploiting this vulnerability could lead to a full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **WCF Endpoint Exploitation:** The attacker must be able to interact with the vulnerable WCF endpoint exposed by KioskSimpleService.exe.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the system where KioskSimpleService.exe is running.
- **Knowledge of the WCF Endpoint:** The attacker must be aware of the existence and functionality of the exposed methods within the WCF endpoint.
- **Ability to Interact with the WCF Endpoint:** The attacker needs the tools or scripts to interact with the exposed WCF endpoint.

**Additional Notes:**
- The CVSS score is pending.
- The vendor, RedSwimmer, Inc., has been notified but the vulnerability remains unresolved as of 07-02-2018.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Ben Larkin of VerSprite Security.
