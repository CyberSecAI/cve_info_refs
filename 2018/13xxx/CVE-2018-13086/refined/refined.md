{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow in the `mintToken` function due to using the `+` operator on `uint256` variables without proper overflow checks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Integer overflow in the `mintToken` function, allowing arbitrary minting and manipulation of user balances.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker (the contract owner) can arbitrarily mint tokens, inflate the token supply, and manipulate the balance of any user by repeatedly calling `mintToken` with large values. This can lead to the balances of users being reduced to zero and devaluing the token.",
  "Attack vectors": "The contract owner calls the vulnerable function `mintToken` with excessively large `mintedAmount` values.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be the owner of the smart contract."
