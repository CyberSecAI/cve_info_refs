Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-13096:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of metadata within the f2fs filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. Specifically, it occurs when mounting a crafted f2fs image with an abnormal bitmap size.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Out-of-bounds memory access:** The kernel attempts to access memory outside of allocated boundaries when processing the crafted f2fs image.
- **BUG:** A kernel BUG is triggered due to the invalid memory access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation results in a denial of service condition, specifically causing the system to crash due to the kernel BUG.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The primary attack vector involves a local attacker who can mount a specially crafted f2fs filesystem image on a vulnerable system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to mount a filesystem image on the target system.  This generally implies local access or the ability to inject a malicious image into a location accessible by the mounting user/process.
- No special privileges are explicitly needed, but access to the system is required. The severity is rated as moderate by SUSE and NVD.

**Additional details:**
-  The `git.kernel.org` content provides the code-level fix for this vulnerability, which adds sanity checks for the inode's node footer and `i_blocks` field.
- The `usn.ubuntu.com` content indicates this vulnerability is among others fixed in a Linux kernel update for Ubuntu systems.
- The `lists.opensuse.org` content shows the fix was part of a security update for openSUSE Leap 42.3.
