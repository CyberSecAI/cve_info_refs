Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-13989:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability found in the Grundig Smart Inter@ctive 3.0 application. This allows an attacker to induce a user to make unwanted requests on the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF:** The application lacks sufficient protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. Specifically the application does not adequately validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of a user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can send arbitrary commands to the Smart Inter@ctive 3.0 application on behalf of a victim if they are on the same network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is carried out by crafting a malicious request and tricking a user to visit a webpage which triggers the request.
- This request is sent to the vulnerable device from the user's browser or device, exploiting the user's session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to induce a user to visit a webpage under their control.
- The attacker needs to know the IP address of the vulnerable device.
- The attacker and victim must be on the same network for the attack to succeed.

**Technical Details**
- The exploit relies on a `GET` request sent to `/sendrcpackage` with specific `keyid` and `keysymbol` parameters.
- The vulnerable application does not validate the origin of the request, allowing an attacker to send arbitrary commands using this endpoint.

**Additional Notes:**

The provided exploit code demonstrates the vulnerability by showing an example of how a crafted request could control a Grundig TV.
