  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow in the `sell` function when calculating the amount of ETH to send to the seller.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `sell` function multiplies the `amount` of tokens being sold by the `sellPrice` to determine how much Ether to send. If `sellPrice` is set to a large value, this multiplication can result in an integer overflow, causing the calculated value to wrap around to zero. This means the seller receives no Ether, effectively losing their tokens.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A user selling tokens can lose their tokens and not receive the expected Ether in return, if the contract owner sets the `sellPrice` to a very high value.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the `sell` function in the smart contract. An attacker (the contract owner) sets a very large `sellPrice` value.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be the owner of the smart contract to set the `sellPrice` to a very large value and must convince a user to call the sell function using that `sellPrice`"
