Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-13100:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing validation of the `secs_per_zone` parameter in the `fs/f2fs/super.c` file when mounting a corrupted f2fs image. Specifically, the code did not check if `secs_per_zone` was zero or greater than `total_sections`, which could lead to a divide-by-zero error when the `GET_ZONE_FROM_SEG` macro is used.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation: The code does not adequately validate the `secs_per_zone` parameter read from the f2fs image.
- Divide-by-zero: An invalid `secs_per_zone` value (specifically zero) can cause a divide-by-zero error during filesystem mounting.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS): By providing a corrupted f2fs image with a zero or invalid `secs_per_zone` value, an attacker can cause a kernel panic or system crash when the filesystem is mounted.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted f2fs image: An attacker needs to create a specially crafted f2fs image that contains an invalid `secs_per_zone` value.
- Mount operation: The attacker needs to mount the crafted f2fs image on the target system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create or modify an f2fs image.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to mount the crafted f2fs image on a vulnerable system.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The fix involves adding a check to make sure `secs_per_zone` is not greater than `total_sections` and that it's not zero during the sanity check in the function `sanity_check_raw_super`.
- The issue was reported by Wen Xu and fixed by Chao Yu.
- Various Linux distributions and SUSE products were affected and have released patches to address this vulnerability
