The provided content contains information about multiple vulnerabilities found in TerraMaster TOS 3.1.03. One of them is CVE-2018-13418.

**CVE-2018-13418:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the user rename functionality within `ajaxdata.php`. The application utilizes a command line tool, and the `newname` parameter, which is user-controlled, is directly passed as an argument without proper sanitization.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Command Injection:** The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the system.
    *   **Insufficient Authorization:** Low-privileged users can perform actions intended only for administrators.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands as the root user on the system.
*   **Attack Vector:** By sending a crafted POST request to the `/include/ajax/ajaxdata.php` endpoint with a malicious payload in the `newname` parameter.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have access to the web interface of the TerraMaster NAS, even as a low-privileged user.
