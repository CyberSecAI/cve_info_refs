Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-13981

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies within the "formmailer" widget of the Zeta Producer Desktop CMS, specifically how it handles file uploads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Unrestricted File Uploads:** The "formmailer" widget allows users to upload files to the server. While it attempts to prevent PHP code execution by renaming `.php` files to `.phps`, it fails to restrict other executable PHP file extensions like `.php5` and `.phtml`.
*   **Predictable Upload Directory:** The server creates a folder using PHP's `uniqid` function to store uploaded files. Although the folder name is random, it's relatively easy to brute-force.
*   **Directory Listing (Optional):** If the server permits directory listing, the attacker can easily discover the uploaded PHP script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious PHP file (e.g., a web shell) with a `.php5` or `.phtml` extension, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Full System Compromise (Potentially):** Successful RCE can lead to a complete compromise of the web server and potentially the underlying system, depending on server configurations.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** Exploitable over the network via the web interface of the Zeta Producer Desktop CMS.
*   **Local Network:** If the Zeta Producer Desktop CMS GUI client runs locally, it is still vulnerable because the built-in web server runs on TCP port 9153.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable application, either directly or via the local network.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know that the "formmailer" widget is vulnerable to arbitrary file upload and how to exploit it.
*   **File Upload Capability:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the "formmailer" functionality.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit-db content provides a python script to demonstrate the exploitation of this vulnerability. (the code is omitted in this response).
*   The vulnerability affects versions <= 14.2.0 of the software.
*   The vendor was unresponsive to multiple attempts to report the vulnerability, however a fix was implemented in version 14.2.1.
*   The advisory recommends users to update to version 14.2.1 or newer and also recommends removing the vulnerable widgets as a workaround.
* The content also mentions another vulnerability related to local file disclosure (CVE-2018-13980).
