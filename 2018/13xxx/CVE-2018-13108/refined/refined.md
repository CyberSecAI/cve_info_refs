Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-13108:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a combination of a web GUI input validation flaw and a Samba configuration file parsing issue. Specifically, the web interface allows modification of Samba configuration parameters ("netbios name" and "workgroup"), but does not properly filter out special characters.
*   The Samba daemon, used for network file sharing on the ADB devices, has a hardcoded setting `wide links = no` to prevent symlink attacks.
*   An attacker can inject crafted input through the web GUI to bypass the `wide links = no` setting by exploiting the way Samba parses its configuration file (smb.conf), effectively enabling symlink traversal to the root file system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The web GUI does not properly sanitize input for the "netbios name" and "workgroup" parameters, allowing an attacker to inject special characters (backslashes).
*   **Samba Configuration Parsing Vulnerability:** The Samba configuration file parser can be tricked by a backslash character at the end of a line, which is interpreted as a line continuation. This allows the attacker to inject "wide links = yes" to override the default "wide links = no" setting.
*   **Insecure Default Samba Configuration:** Samba runs with root privileges, and file sharing is exported with root user permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Root Access:** Successful exploitation grants the attacker root-level access to the device's file system.
*   **Configuration Modification:** Attackers can modify any settings on the device, bypassing ISP restrictions.
*   **Data Exfiltration:**  Attackers can retrieve stored user credentials, such as VoIP passwords, PPP, wireless or CPE management passwords, and potentially SSL private keys.
*   **Network Attacks:** The compromised device can be used as a jump host to attack the internal network of the ISP or other connected networks.
*   **Malware Installation:** Attackers can add backdoors or sniffers to the device, potentially leading to further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical Access:** The attacker needs to insert a specially crafted USB drive into the vulnerable ADB device.
*   **Web GUI:** The attacker interacts with the device's web interface to modify Samba settings.
*   **Network Share:**  After the USB drive is inserted and the share exported, the attacker accesses the root file system through a network share.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical access** to the vulnerable device to insert a manipulated USB drive.
*   **Local Network Access:** Access to the local network the device is on to interact with the web GUI and access the created file share.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** Familiarity with web proxies (e.g., Burp), creating symlinks, Samba configuration and Linux file systems.

**Additional Notes**
* The vulnerability is present in all ADB modems/gateways/routers based on the Epicentro platform with USB ports and network file sharing features.
* The vulnerability is exploitable in all firmware versions for all ADB customers (ISPs).
* The device uses a samba daemon, and the samba configuration file (smb.conf) has a default setting of `wide links = no`.
* The attacker can create a symlink to the root file system on a USB drive and then mount the drive to gain access
* By manipulating the /tmp/passwd and /tmp/ui_session files an attacker can gain root access through telnet and change settings in the web GUI

This vulnerability requires physical access to the device, which means it's not a remote attack. However, once compromised, the attacker can gain full control and pivot to the ISP's internal network.
