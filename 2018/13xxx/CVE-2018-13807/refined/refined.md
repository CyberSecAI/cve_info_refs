Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)** in the web interface of the Siemens SCALANCE X switches. Specifically, the webserver on port 443/TCP does not properly handle specially crafted packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The web server fails to validate incoming data, leading to a denial-of-service condition upon receiving malicious packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS):**  Successful exploitation causes the affected device to reboot, temporarily interrupting network availability. This disrupts communication for other connected devices.
*   **Availability Impact:**  The primary impact is the temporary loss of network availability due to the device rebooting.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-based Attack:** Attackers must have network access to the affected devices, specifically to port 443/TCP.
*   **Specially Crafted Packets:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted packets to the web server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to reach port 443/TCP on the vulnerable device.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No valid credentials are required, and no interaction from a legitimate user is necessary to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Publicly Available Tools:** The vulnerability can be exploited using publicly available tools and vulnerability scanners.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
*   Affected products include SCALANCE X300 (all versions prior to 4.0.0), SCALANCE X408 (all versions prior to 4.0.0), and SCALANCE X414 (all versions).
*   The vulnerability is remotely exploitable with low skill requirements.
*   Siemens has released updates for SCALANCE X300 and X408 and provides mitigation for the SCALANCE X414. The mitigation for X414 includes restricting network access to port 443/tcp to trusted IP addresses and avoiding running vulnerability scanning tools from untrusted IP addresses on affected devices.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.6.
*  Siemens also recommends general security measures such as protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms.
