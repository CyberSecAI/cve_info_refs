Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2018-13324:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in how the `buffalo_jsonrpc2.py` script handles the `Host` header in requests to the `/nasapi/` endpoint. The script checks if the `Host` header is set to `127.0.0.1`. If it is, the script instructs `BuffaloJsonRpc.process` to bypass authentication checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** By manipulating the `Host` header to `127.0.0.1`, an attacker can bypass authentication checks for the JSON RPC API.
*   **Insecure Host Header Handling:** The API improperly trusts the client-supplied `Host` header, leading to the bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An unauthenticated attacker can bypass authentication and execute arbitrary API calls. This can include actions like:

*   Changing the device hostname.
*   Potentially modifying other device settings.
*   Exploiting other vulnerabilities that require authentication, such as command injection vulnerabilities via user creation, or domain setting updates, or the internal function access issues.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploited via network requests to the NAS device's API endpoint (`/nasapi/`).
*   **HTTP Header Manipulation:** The attack is performed by sending an HTTP request with a crafted `Host` header.
*   **JSON RPC API:** The attack targets the JSON RPC API of the Buffalo TeraStation NAS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the vulnerable NAS device.
*   **HTTP Request Capabilities:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the NAS device, crafting the `Host` header.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker doesn't need to have valid credentials initially due to the authentication bypass vulnerability.
