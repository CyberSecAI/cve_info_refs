| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1028975#c0)  Thomas Wagner   2017-03-10 21:41:04 UTC  ``` I installed nagios 4.3.1 in Leap 42.2 from server:monitoring. During installation an empty folder /var/spool/nagios is created. Upon first start of nagios the named pipe /var/spool/nagios is created with user "nagios" and group "nagios". However, it should be created as group "nagcmd" in order to allow control of nagios via the webinterface (like re-sheduling a check). ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1028975#c1)  Lars Vogdt   2017-03-30 09:48:16 UTC  ``` Please see my comment in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/478635> - this is not the right fix for your problem. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1028975#c2)  Lars Vogdt   2017-03-30 10:53:36 UTC  ``` @Ansgar: I like to leave the final decision to you as I'm just co-maintainer for openSUSE here.   Always allowing the nagcmd group to write into this file might not be the best idea from my pow. Especially as "check_external_commands" might be disabled in the nagios configuration. I did not check, yet, what happens if "someone" writes into the pipe regardless of the configuration settings... ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1028975#c3)  Ansgar Esztermann   2018-10-02 08:54:46 UTC  ``` Upstream installs $CHECKRESULTDIR with setgid $command_grp (so when nagios creates the named pipe, it is owned by group nagcmd automatically), but we don't.  Unless there's some compelling reason not to, I'd prefer reverting to upstream behaviour here. However, this must not be done in %post. Instead, the %attr entry needs to be changed. If there are no objections, I'll create an SR. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1028975#c4)  Lars Vogdt   2018-10-02 11:28:21 UTC  ``` (In reply to Ansgar Esztermann from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1028975#c3)) > Upstream installs $CHECKRESULTDIR with setgid $command_grp (so when nagios > creates the named pipe, it is owned by group nagcmd automatically), but we > don't. >  > Unless there's some compelling reason not to, I'd prefer reverting to > upstream behaviour here. However, this must not be done in %post. Instead, > the %attr entry needs to be changed. If there are no objections, I'll create > an SR.  Absolutely fine with me.   Let's add security here to also have a look and give their ok. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1028975#c5)  Lars Vogdt   2018-10-02 11:34:09 UTC  ``` JFYI from the changelog:  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Fri Jul  8 11:35:37 UTC 2011 - lars@linux-schulserver.de  - removed setuid bit from /var/spool/nagios - configure the    right permissions on service start instead  --------------------------------------------------------------------  From my memory: setting the setguid (I assume the "setuid" in the changes file is a typo) bit for the directory would allow any application in the nagioscmd group to write into this directory.   While this might be wanted for most systems, the current "default" is a bit more secure as it only allows the nagios daemon itself to write into the directory.   Using a permissions file, that allows to adapt the permissions for the directory, might be a possible solution here that allows a very secure standard installation while informed users could change the setup via the permission file (and calling "chkstat --system --set"). ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1028975#c6)  Marcus Meissner   2018-10-04 13:09:00 UTC  ``` moving to audits ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1028975#c7)  Johannes Segitz   2018-10-04 13:37:38 UTC  ``` I will look at this ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1028975#c8)  Johannes Segitz   2018-10-12 07:12:50 UTC  ``` So I checked this and setting the directory to setgid is an acceptable solution. If check_external_commands is disabled then the code checks for this and doesn't open the pipe. Separating the group for the daemon from the group that is allowed to run commands is a good idea. The "chkstat --system --set" workaround is too annoying to users as a permanent solution.  While checking this I also had a (brief) look at some of the external commands (we don't package them), but they look good to me. ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1028975#c9)  Lars Vogdt   2018-10-12 09:06:32 UTC  ``` (In reply to Johannes Segitz from [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=1028975#c8)) > So I checked this and setting the directory to setgid is an acceptable > solution.

The "chkstat --system > --set" workaround is too annoying to users as a permanent solution.  Thank you for your audit, Johannes. It's always better to have more eyes looking at such security relevant items.   Ansgar: feel free to send your submit request with a reference to this bug number in the changes file. I assign the bug to you, so you can close it once your submit request is accepted. ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1028975#c10)  Ansgar Esztermann   2018-10-16 07:27:27 UTC  ``` @Lars: SR created. I could accept it myself, although that feels a bit weird. ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1028975#c11)  Ansgar Esztermann   2018-10-24 06:50:03 UTC  ``` Fixed in Factory ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1028975#c13)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-04-06 21:00:07 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1028975) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/791855> 15.1 / nagios ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1028975#c14)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-04-06 21:50:10 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1028975) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/791861> 15.1 / ansible+nagios ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1028975#c15)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-04-11 16:13:22 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2020:0500-1: An update that fixes 5 vulnerabilities is now available.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
