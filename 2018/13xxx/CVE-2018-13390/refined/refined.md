Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The cloudtoken daemon, when run on Linux, exposed an unauthenticated HTTP endpoint.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities**:
    *   Unauthenticated access: The HTTP endpoint was accessible without requiring any authentication.
    *   Credential Exposure: The exposed endpoint allowed retrieval of temporary AWS credentials.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**: Attackers could gain temporary AWS credentials associated with the user's role.
*   **Attack Vectors**: Network-based attacks from the same subnet.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   The attacker must be on the same subnet as the vulnerable cloudtoken daemon.
    *   No authentication is required to access the exposed endpoint.

**Summary:**
The cloudtoken versions 0.1.1 to 0.1.23 had a vulnerability allowing unauthenticated network access to an HTTP endpoint. Attackers on the same subnet could exploit this to obtain temporary AWS credentials. Version 0.1.24 contains a fix for the vulnerability.
