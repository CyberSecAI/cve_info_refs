Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-13849:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient input sanitization in the `edit_requests.php` file of the Instagram-clone script. Specifically, the script uses `preg_replace` with a regex that attempts to remove angle brackets `<` and `>` and spaces from user inputs like `username`, `firstname`, `surname`, `bio`, `instagram`, `youtube`, `facebook`, `twitter`, `website`. However the regex can be bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The inadequate filtering allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code within user profile fields. Since the injected code is stored in the database, it becomes persistent (i.e., stored XSS).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browsers of users who view the affected user profile.
- **Session Hijacking:** The injected JavaScript can steal user session cookies.
- **Account Takeover:** An attacker could potentially gain control over user accounts through stolen credentials or other malicious actions executed by the injected script.
- **Defacement:** Inject JavaScript to alter the appearance of pages viewed by other users, potentially defacing the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Profile Editing Form:** The primary attack vector is the user profile editing form (`edit_requests.php`). An attacker can manipulate input fields such as `username`, `firstname`, `surname`, `bio`, `instagram`, `youtube`, `facebook`, `twitter`, `website` to inject malicious JavaScript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a registered user of the Instagram-clone application.
- **Profile Editing Access:**  The attacker needs the ability to access the profile editing section where the vulnerable inputs are accepted.

**Technical Details:**
- The code snippet below is vulnerable:
```php
if (isset($_POST['username'])) {
      $username = preg_replace("#[<> ]#i", "", $_POST['username']);
      $firstname = preg_replace("#[<> ]#i", "", $_POST['firstname']);
      $surname = preg_replace("#[<> ]#i", "", $_POST['surname']);
      $bio = preg_replace("#[<>]#i", "", $_POST['bio']);
      $instagram = preg_replace("#[<>]#i", "", $_POST['instagram']);
      $youtube = preg_replace("#[<>]#i", "", $_POST['youtube']);
      $facebook = preg_replace("#[<>]#i", "", $_POST['facebook']);
      $twitter = preg_replace("#[<>]#i", "", $_POST['twitter']);
      $website = preg_replace("#[<>]#i", "", $_POST['website']);
      $mobile = preg_replace("#[^0-9]#i", "", $_POST['mobile']);
      $tags = preg_replace("#[\s]#", "-", $_POST['tags']);
 $session = $_SESSION['id'];
      $m=$edit->saveProfileEditing($username, $firstname, $surname, $bio,
$instagram, $youtube, $facebook, $twitter, $website, $mobile, $tags);
      $array = array("mssg" => $m);
      echo json_encode($array);
    }
```
- The payload `onmouseover=" alert(document.cookie)"` bypasses the regex and injects the malicious code

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit-db entry provides a proof of concept for the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is present in version 2.0 of the Instagram-clone script.
- The GitHub repository for the vulnerable script is identified.
- The regex used for sanitization is flawed.
