The provided content is related to CVE-2018-13315.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The TOTOLINK A3002RU router does not perform server-side validation of the current password when a user attempts to change it. The router relies solely on client-side JavaScript validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing server-side validation of the current password during password change.
- Lack of authentication tokens, making it easier to spoof requests.
- Reliance on client-side JavaScript for critical security checks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can change the user's password without knowing the current password.
- This can lead to unauthorized access to the router's administrative interface.

**Attack vectors:**
- A crafted HTTP POST request can be sent to the `/boafrm/formPasswordSetup` endpoint with a new password and without any validation of the current password.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the router or have some access to the network.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface.
- The attacker does not need to know the current password.
- Requires that an admin has recently logged into the web interface.

**Additional details:**
- The article mentions that the router doesn't send session tokens and considers requests authenticated if a user has logged in recently (approx 5 minutes).
- The router trusts that client-side Javascript check is enough to validate current passwords before allowing a change.
