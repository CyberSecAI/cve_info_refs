Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-13412:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an insecure method of launching the Self Service Portal within ManageEngine Desktop Central Agent. The `dcagenttrayicon.exe` application, when launched with the `-ssp` flag, opens a window running with SYSTEM privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:**  The primary vulnerability is that an unprivileged user can launch a program (`dcagenttrayicon.exe`) in a way that allows them to access a component with SYSTEM privileges.
*   **Insecure Browser Launch:** The Self Service Portal window contains a "Powered by ManageEngine Desktop Central" comment with a logo. Clicking this logo opens a web browser, which inherits the SYSTEM privileges of the parent process (Self Service Portal window).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full System Control:** An attacker can gain SYSTEM-level access. This enables them to execute arbitrary commands, install malware, access sensitive data, modify system settings, and effectively take complete control of the affected machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local; the attacker needs to have a user account on a machine with the vulnerable Desktop Central Agent installed.
*   **Exploitation Path:** The attacker can use the following steps:
    1.  Execute `C:\Program Files (x86)\DesktopCentral_Agent\bin\dcagenttrayicon.exe" -ssp` to open the Self Service Portal window.
    2.  Click the ManageEngine logo within that window.
    3. This will launch the default web browser under SYSTEM privileges.
    4.  From this browser instance, the attacker can open `cmd.exe` or `powershell.exe` and execute arbitrary commands with SYSTEM privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker must have a user account on a Windows machine with the vulnerable Desktop Central Agent installed.
*   **Basic Execution Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to execute commands via the command line and navigate a web browser.

**Additional Notes**

* The vulnerability was fixed in version 10.0.282 of the Desktop Central agent.
* The provided information confirms the details of CVE-2018-13412 as a local privilege escalation vulnerability in ManageEngine Desktop Central, allowing unauthenticated users with local access to execute commands with SYSTEM privileges through an insecurely launched web browser instance.
