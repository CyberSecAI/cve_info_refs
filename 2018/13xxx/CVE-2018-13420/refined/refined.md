The provided content is an issue report from the gperftools project on Github. It details a memory leak detected by LeakSanitizer when running the `sampler_test` program.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A memory leak exists in the `src/malloc_extension.cc` file. Specifically, memory allocated in the `InitModule` function at line 212 and registered in the `MallocExtension::Register` function at line 226 is not being freed, leading to a memory leak.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is a memory leak. The code allocates memory using `operator new` but lacks the corresponding `delete` operation, causing the allocated memory to be unreachable and unrecoverable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact of this memory leak is that the program consumes more memory over time. While the leak is small (8 bytes in 1 allocation in the provided report), repeated calls or prolonged program execution could result in significant memory consumption. This may lead to performance degradation or, in extreme cases, program termination due to memory exhaustion.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be triggered by simply running the affected program (`sampler_test` in this case). There isn't a specific attack vector, it's a programming error that is exposed by program execution.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
No attacker is needed to trigger this issue. Any user running the vulnerable program will experience the memory leak.
