{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow in the `mintToken` function of the UCoinToken smart contract.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Integer overflow: The `mintToken` function adds the `mintedAmount` to the `balanceOf[target]` using the `+=` operator. When `mintedAmount` is very large, it can cause an integer overflow, which results in an unexpected balance for the target address.",
    "Arbitrary minting: The `mintToken` function allows the contract owner to arbitrarily mint tokens to any user.",
     "Lack of overflow check: The function does not check for integer overflows before updating the balance."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The contract owner can manipulate the balance of any user by minting large amounts of tokens, and because of integer overflow,  the balance can be unexpectedly set to 0 or any other arbitrary value.",
  "Attack vectors": "The contract owner calls the `mintToken` function with an extremely large `mintedAmount`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be the owner of the smart contract."
