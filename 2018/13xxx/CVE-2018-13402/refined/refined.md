The provided content is related to CVE-2018-13402.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an open redirect in multiple resources within Atlassian Jira.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Open redirect vulnerability: The application allows redirection to an arbitrary URL controlled by the attacker. This is due to insufficient validation of the target URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites.
- In some cases, attackers can obtain a user's Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) token. This can lead to more severe attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A remote attacker can craft a malicious URL that uses the open redirect vulnerability.
- By tricking the user to click on the malicious crafted link, the user is redirected to the attacker controlled website and/or has their CSRF token exposed to the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL containing the vulnerable parameter
- The attacker needs to be able to trick the user into visiting the malicious URL.
