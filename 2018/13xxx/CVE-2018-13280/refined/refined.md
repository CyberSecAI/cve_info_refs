- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the use of insufficiently random values in the `SYNO.Encryption.GenRandomKey` function within Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the lack of sufficient randomness in the key generation process. This makes the generated keys predictable or guessable.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful man-in-the-middle attack allows adversaries to compromise non-HTTPS sessions. This means they can intercept and potentially manipulate data exchanged during those sessions. The CVSS vector indicates high impact on confidentiality and integrity, but no impact on availability.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable over a network (AV:N). It requires a man-in-the-middle position (i.e., an attacker needs to be positioned in the network path between the client and the server).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be in a man-in-the-middle position on the network and no special privileges or user interaction is required. The attack requires a high level of effort (AC:H).
