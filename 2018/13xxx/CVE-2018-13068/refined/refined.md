{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow in the `mintToken` function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `mintToken` function increments `balanceOf[target]` and `totalSupply` using the `+` operator, which can lead to an integer overflow if `mintedAmount` is sufficiently large. Specifically, if the addition exceeds the maximum value for a `uint256`, the result will wrap around to zero.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker, specifically the contract owner, can arbitrarily manipulate the balance of any user by repeatedly calling the `mintToken` function. The overflow allows the owner to set any user's balance to an arbitrary value (specifically, setting it to 0 after a large overflow).",
  "Attack vectors": "The `mintToken` function is publicly accessible but limited to the contract owner, allowing the owner to mint an arbitrary amount of tokens.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be the contract owner to exploit this vulnerability."
