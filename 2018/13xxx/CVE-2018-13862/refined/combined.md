|  | fix | config | system wide active icon color defaulted to black. |
|  | add | user interface | added support for browser buttons - in addition to still existing "3rd party automation support" via builtin web browser and activation using "ModeSwitch" button. |
|  | add | config | added advanced option/special command to hide touchpad settings menu(s). |
|  | fix | knx | simple macros do now work. |
|  | add | config | optional password protection. |
|  | fix | a13 | improved memory timing. |

|  | fix | system | macros did not work. |
| 2.43 - 08.03.2017 | | | |
|  | fix | user interface | missing update of time display with standalone touchpads (no controller connection). |
|  | fix | system | device sometimes not visible in serveradmin tool after getting a delayed dhcp address. |
|  | add | web config | warning if network interface is limited by an inactive default gateway. |
|  | fix | system | ARM9 touchpads only: static ip setup caused limited communication of touchpad with network, e.g. block of software update, no weather data, no icons with webradio and some audio services. to update such touchpads use DHCP temporarily. occured since build 11666 of 30.06.2016. |
| 2.42 - 27.01.2017 | | | |
|  | add | knx | climate object: comfort temperature lower and higher limit with default 5 and 40. |
|  | add | user interface | navigation control: option to use no icon, with optimized text rendering in sizes 1x1 and 2x1. allows to be used as a static text display if target page is the same page. |
|  | fix | system | all trivum devices that started while no DHCP or network was available showed a MAC address 00:00:00:... in ServerAdmin tool or control unit lists, permanently until restart, even if DHCP was available later. this caused touchpads to ignore server side configuration. |
|  | fix | config | show current screen: failed with Safari browser due to missing http headers. |
|  | add | system | option for remote support of newer touchpads (not with ARM9 touchpads). |

|  | chg | system | support for new update channels. |
| 2.41 - 28.10.2016 | | | |
|  | chg | config | 4" touchpad: no longer showing +/- volume option as this always uses +/- buttons. |
|  | fix | knx | shutter non centered icons. |
|  | fix | knx | non centered icons especially with large buttons. |
|  | fix | system | endless restart with "low memory web" message in some cases, until cold restart. |
|  | chg | config | some serialnumbers of trivum hardware were shown in the wrong format |
|  | fix | system | some trivum products had sometimes wrong descriptions when shown in the configuration/bind screen |
|  | chg | knx | list of used knx addresses now uses colors |

|  | add | config | 7" touchpad browser resolution info, displays 1024x536 (landscape) or 600x960 (portrait). |
|  | fix | knx | shutter: wrong icon display with small size with types like shutter up, or curtain open. |
|  | add | config | on "show current screen" users can now simulate a touch with a mouse click. This helps to test the TouchPad from remote |
|  | fix | knx | added missing 'show used knx objects' in the knx setup |
|  | fix | knx | KNX multicast address can now also be 239.x.x.x and not only 224.x.x.x. Actually if it starts with 224, it should be 224.0.23.12. Otherwise we show a warning to use 239.x.x.x instead of 224.x.x.x. |
|  | fix | knx | KNX router search did not work when the multicast address is different to 224.0.23.12. Internally we now always use 224.0.23.12 for SEARCH\_REQUEST because all IP routers listen to 224.0.23.12 for SEARCH\_REQEUST. For listening to SEARCH\_RESULT we use the configured multicast address. |
|  | chg | knx | We now show the time of the last SEARCH\_RESULT message for each found IP router. |

|  | fix | 7inch | accidential v8 downgrade is now blocked. |
|  | fix | system | missing startup messages with SW version and IP. |
|  | fix | 7inch | brightness could not be set to completely dark. |
|  | chg | user interface | when pressing the alarm info area on the home/off-screen, the touchpad now shows directly the alarm setup menu |
|  | chg | update | faster software update esp. with ARM9 touchpads. |
|  | fix | user interface | no change in stream position display during fast forward/backward. |
|  | fix | user interface | keyboard does not support special characters because we now handle UTF8 |
|  | fix | knx | fan coil and climate: cannot change temperature offset, fan speed values. |
|  | fix | knx | cannot enter temperature offset "0.5". |
|  | fix | config | missing expert mode setting. |
|  | fix | knx | rgb acutator config: could not change type. |
|  | fix | control | about this touchpad: wrong update channel info. |
|  | fix | 7inch | wrong update channel selected. |
|  | fix | control | crash on zone selection with analogue input active. |
|  | chg | config | now always using UTF8, option removed |
|  | fix | config | german umlauts display. |
|  | add | control | configurable default time to change back to default mode, by default 60 seconds. |
|  | fix | control | no automatic change from knx to audio screen. |

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
