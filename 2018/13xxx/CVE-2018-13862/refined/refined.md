Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2018-13862:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**
   - The provided content includes a description of CVE-2018-13862 from multiple sources (exploit-db.com and vulncode.com), confirming that the information is directly related to this CVE.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `/xml/system/setAttribute.xml` endpoint of the Trivum WebTouch Setup software.
   - Specifically, the lack of proper access control on this endpoint allows for unauthorized modification of the `protectAccess` attribute.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    -  **Authentication Bypass**: The primary weakness is the ability to bypass authentication.
   -  **Insecure Direct Object Reference**: The use of a direct object reference in the `setAttribute.xml` URL (`?id=0&attr=protectAccess&newValue=0`) is insecure, because it allows direct access to modify a system setting.
   -  **Lack of Authorization**: The vulnerability lies in the fact that the endpoint does not require proper authorization or authentication before allowing changes to sensitive system settings, which is the root cause of the authentication bypass.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
   - Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to reset the authentication, effectively disabling password protection.
   - This enables unauthorized access to the Touchpad/Trivum WebTouch Setup interface.
   - Full control of the device's configurations.

**5. Attack vectors:**
   - The attack vector is **remote**, utilizing an HTTP GET request.
   - Attackers send a crafted GET request to the `/xml/system/setAttribute.xml` endpoint.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Trivum WebTouch device.
   - No prior authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

- Vulnerable Endpoint: `/xml/system/setAttribute.xml`
- Attack Payload: `?id=0&attr=protectAccess&newValue=0`
- Affected Software: Touchpad / Trivum WebTouch Setup V9 V2.53 build 13163 (and possibly earlier versions)
- Fixed Version : 2.56 build 13381 (and later versions)
