- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically within the `admin.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious script code into vulnerable parameters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Non-persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in multiple parameters of the `admin.php` file, specifically `path`, `search`, `rename`, and `dir`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to session hijacking, non-persistent phishing attacks, non-persistent redirects to malicious sources, and non-persistent manipulation of affected or connected application modules.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is remote and non-persistent, using GET requests to inject malicious scripts via vulnerable parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any prior privileges or a user session to exploit the vulnerability and requires low user interaction to trigger the malicious script.
