{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The web application allows for command injection by including backticks (`) in the FTP username.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Command Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary system commands can be executed on the router's operating system. This can lead to full system compromise, including data exfiltration, malware installation, or denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious user sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/boafrm/formDlna` endpoint, including backticks (`) in the `ftpUser` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface. This could be achieved through network access to the router (e.g., being on the same local network or through a port forward). The attacker would also need a basic understanding of how to craft HTTP requests and encode them."
