- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Information exposure due to a world-readable configuration file `/usr/syno/etc/mount.conf`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the overly permissive access rights of the configuration file.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote authenticated users can obtain sensitive information from the configuration file.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is accessed remotely via the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the affected system.
