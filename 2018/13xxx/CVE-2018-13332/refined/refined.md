{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The 'path' URL parameter in the file upload functionality of the TerraMaster TOS is not properly validated, allowing an attacker to specify an arbitrary file upload location.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation",
       "Arbitrary file upload"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can upload arbitrary files to any location on the server's filesystem, potentially overwriting system files or uploading malicious executable files.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can send a crafted POST request to the `/3.0/index.php?explorer/fileUpload` endpoint with a manipulated `path` parameter, specifying the target location for the uploaded file.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the affected server. This could be achieved through direct network access, through a compromised user account, or by tricking an authenticated user into sending the request (CSRF)."
