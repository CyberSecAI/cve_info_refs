{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow in the `mintToken` function due to unchecked addition of `mintedAmount` to `balanceOf[target]` and `totalSupply`. Both `balanceOf[target]` and `mintedAmount` are defined as uint256, which are susceptible to overflow when the result exceeds the maximum value of a uint256, wrapping around to 0.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Integer Overflow",
     "Unrestricted Minting"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker, specifically the contract owner, can arbitrarily mint tokens to any user, and manipulate the balance of any user by overflowing the balance to 0. This can lead to inflation of the token supply or deflation by setting user balance to zero, effectively allowing the attacker to steal users' funds by causing their balances to be zero.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Calling the `mintToken` function with a large `mintedAmount` parameter."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be the owner of the smart contract to call the `mintToken` function."
