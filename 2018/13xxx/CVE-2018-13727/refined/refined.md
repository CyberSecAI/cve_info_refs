The provided content does not contain specific information about CVE-2018-13727. However, it does point to a file named `mint integer overflow.md` within the `Eastcoin` directory of the `EtherTokens` repository. This filename suggests the presence of an integer overflow vulnerability related to minting tokens, which is the vulnerability detailed in CVE-2018-13727.

Based on this context:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Integer overflow when minting tokens

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Integer overflow vulnerability in the mint function of a smart contract.

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could potentially mint a large number of tokens, exceeding the intended supply, thus affecting the token's value and potentially allowing for unauthorized control of funds.

**Attack Vectors:** Attacking the smart contract using a malicious transaction that exploits the integer overflow flaw.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable smart contract by sending transactions. This implies the attacker would likely need to have some amount of initial funds in the cryptocurrency to interact with the contract and exploit this vulnerability.
