Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities, though it's important to note that **CVE-2018-13787 is not explicitly mentioned**. The content discusses several firmware vulnerabilities in Supermicro products that are related to but not specifically identified as this CVE.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Incorrect Descriptor Region Settings:** Some Supermicro products were shipped with improper settings for the Descriptor Region, a security feature of Intel chipsets, allowing software running on the OS to modify the Descriptor Region.
*   **Insecure Firmware Updates:** Some Supermicro systems lacked secure authentication for firmware updates, allowing modified firmware to be installed.
*   **Lack of Anti-Rollback Protection:** A lack of anti-rollback protection for firmware images allows attackers to replace newer, patched firmware with older, vulnerable versions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Writable Flash Descriptor:** The flash descriptor, which should be read-only, was writable, allowing modification of firmware access control settings.
*   **Missing Firmware Authentication:** Lack of cryptographic signature validation of the firmware before flashing allowed execution of arbitrary code embedded in malicious firmware.
*   **Missing Anti-rollback Protection:** Absence of anti-rollback mechanisms allowed downgrading firmware to older vulnerable versions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Persistent Malware Foothold:** Successful exploitation allows malware to gain a persistent foothold on infected systems, surviving OS reinstalls.
*   **Firmware Tampering:** Attackers can modify the firmware to control the hardware and bypass other security measures.
*   **System Compromise:** An attacker could completely compromise the system by implanting a malicious firmware and gaining persistent access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Software/Code:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited by malware already running on the system.
*   **Modified Firmware Images:** Attackers can modify legitimate firmware images and install them on the vulnerable system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Initial Access:** The attacker needs initial access to the system to execute malicious software.
*   **Local Privilege:** The attacker requires local system privileges to exploit the vulnerabilities and access the firmware.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerabilities affect multiple generations of Supermicro products (X8, X9, X10, and some X11).
*   Supermicro is working on fixes, including signed firmware updates and anti-rollback protection, especially for newer platforms.
*   A tool called CHIPSEC Framework is mentioned, which can be used to check descriptor access controls.
*   A list of potentially vulnerable Supermicro models was provided in the BleepingComputer article.

**Note:** While the content describes vulnerabilities related to firmware security on Supermicro systems, it does not directly refer to CVE-2018-13787. Instead, it discusses several vulnerabilities discovered by Eclypsium and others that are separate from but potentially related to the scope of CVE-2018-13787
