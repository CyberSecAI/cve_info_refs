Security Vulnerabilities Regarding Side Channel Speculative Execution and Indirect Branch Prediction Information Disclosure (CVE-2017-5715, CVE-2017-5753, CVE-2017-5754, CVE-2018-3639, CVE-2018-3640, CVE-2018-3615, CVE-2018-3620, CVE-2018-3646)

Details regarding a microprocessor vulnerability that could impact Supermicro systems has been announced and requires a microcode update of the system BIOS along with an operating system update. Commonly referred to as Meltdown and Spectre the vulnerability involves malicious code utilizing a new method of side-channel analysis and running locally on a normally operating platform has the potential to allow the inference of data values from memory.

To address the issue systems may require both an Operating System update and a BIOS update. Please check with operating system or VM vendors for related information.

* [Intel Advisory (Intel-SA-00088)](https://security-center.intel.com/advisory.aspx?intelid=INTEL-SA-00088&languageid=en-fr)
* [AMD Advisory](https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/speculative-execution)
* [NVD CVE-2017-5715](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5715)
* [NVD CVE-2017-5754](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5754)
* [NVD CVE-2017-5753](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5753)
#### UPDATE (August 14, 2018):

On August 14th Intel released information about a new side-channel security issue referred to as

* L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF)
* L1 Terminal Fault –SGX (CVE-2018-3615)
* L1 Terminal Fault -OS, SMM (CVE-2018-3620)
* L1 Terminal Fault –VMM (CVE-2018-3646)

Based on the information provided by Intel **no new update of the Supermicro BIOS or Firmware is required at this time**, "Fault is addressed by microcode updates released earlier this year". Please check the tables below which indicate the BIOS version with the most up to date fixes for the Spectre and Meltdown issues. These updates which were released earlier this year contain the necessary fixes for these new issues identified by Intel.

#### UPDATE (June 8, 2018):

A 3rd party security firm who has been testing the BIOS/Firmware security of our systems. They recently published the results of that effort and we have introduced fixes to the issues raised in the blog.

There are three different security areas identified in the blog.

1. Read/Write versus Read Only Firmware/Flash Descriptor Table

   This issue does not affect the latest generation of X11 or earlier generation X9 products, but X10 products are impacted. We do not believe this issue will impact any customers data, but could make the system non-operational.

   For the effected platforms we will be rolling out the fix along w/ the latest Spectre/Meltdown (Intel-SA-00115) firmware update. These combined updates will be rolling out over the next few weeks. Please check the status of individual updates below. We are combining this update with the fix for latest fix for the Spectre/Meltdown BIOS to minimize the number of reboots and BIOS updates required.
2. The two other issues raised in the article are new security features (cryptographically signing the BIOS and limiting BIOS downgrades in cases of a critical security patch). We are already shipping these features for some customers and for all new platforms moving forward these features are enabled.

   Due to issues of backward compatibility, we are making the upgrade to these new features optional for existing systems. For customers with existing platforms please contact your sales representative or associated product manager to determine if upgrading the features for software signing and limited rollbacks on your existing systems is appropriate. A new BIOS with these features enabled will be required. Availability of the BIOS will be based on demand.

BIOS and Firmware security has become a growing challenge for the industry. We highly recommend customers update BIOS and Firmware on their systems on a regular basis as these new vulnerabilities are addressed.

#### UPDATE (May 21, 2018):

On May 21st 2018 Intel announced additional microcode updates will be released (Intel-SA-00115). These new updates will include enhancements to address these potential security vulnerabilities.

* CVE-2018-3639 7.1 High CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N
* CVE-2018-3640 4.3 Medium CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N

When Intel releases the microcode we will productize, test and release new BIOS. Please refer to the comment column in the tables below regarding version and status for these additional BIOS updates.

For AMD systems, refer to the H11 & H8 tab below.

We will update this web page with BIOS updates when they become available.

# Firmware Vulnerabilities Disclosed in Supermicro Server Products

![Supermicro](https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/posts/2018/06/07/Supermicro.jpg)

Security researchers have uncovered vulnerabilities affecting the firmware of Supermicro server products.

Discovered by the Eclypsium team, these vulnerabilities affect both older and newer models of Supermicro products, but the vendor is working on addressing the issues.

These vulnerabilities do not put the safety of Supermicro products at direct risk, as they can only be exploited via malicious software/code (aka malware) already running on a system. Nevertheless, exploiting these vulnerabilities allows the malware to obtain an almost permanent foothold on infected systems by gaining the ability to survive server OS reinstalls by hiding in the hardware's firmware.

## Malware can modify Descriptor Region settings

The first of the flaws uncovered by Eclypsium researchers is not an actual vulnerability in the firmware's code, but in the configuration of some Supermicro products.

Researchers say that some of these products come with firmware that uses an improper setting for the "Descriptor Region."

The Descriptor Region is a security feature of Intel-based chipsets. This setting tells the chipset what areas of its own flash storage external parties can access to store data such as firmware or configuration files.

According to Eclypsium researchers, some Supermicro products had an incorrectly set Descriptor Region that allowed software running on the OS (such as malware) to modify the Descriptor Region and then tamper with local firmware.

"Eclypsium researchers have observed vulnerable descriptor access controls through runtime examination of various server firmware models," the Eclypsium team wrote in a [report](https://blog.eclypsium.com/2018/06/07/firmware-vulnerabilities-in-supermicro-systems/) published today.

"This manual analysis uncovered multiple server models that allowed writes to the flash descriptor from host software. According to Supermicro, some of the products we reviewed date back to 2008 and are currently EOL and no longer supported."

## No firmware authentication for some products

But while modifying the Descriptor Region setting may be possible on some Supermicro products, tampering with the local firmware isn't as easy as it sounds, as several security mechanisms prevent malicious actors from altering a computer or server's most important code.

Here is where the second series of issues that the Eclypsium team discovered came into play.

"We have observed insecure firmware updates through runtime examination of various systems. This manual analysis uncovered that Supermicro X9DRi-LN4F+ and X10SLM-F systems did not securely authenticate firmware updates," the research team said.

"We confirmed this result by intentionally modifying the binary in official Supermicro firmware images and observing that the system firmware still accepted and installed the modified package."

## No firmware rollback protection

But the issues didn't stop here, and the Eclypsium team also noted a lack of anti-rollback protections for firmware images.

This anti-rollback protection is crucial for situations where the vendor checks for firmware authenticity.

A firmware anti-rollback protection would prevent attackers from replacing newer firmware with an older (legitimate) firmware image that contains flaws that attackers can exploit and gain a foothold on all-of-a-sudden vulnerable systems.

## Supermicro working on fixes

Eclypsium says it notified Supermicro about all the issues they discovered in the firmware of their products back in January.

"Supermicro has been supportive of our efforts and prioritized understanding and mitigating the issues we have discovered," Eclypsium says,

"For the current generation of products, Supermicro indicated that they have already implemented a signed firmware update for several products and are making this update generally available for all future systems.

"Similarly, for OEM customers who require rollback capability for their customized and locked firmware versions to ensure business continuity, Supermicro indicated that they are supporting anti-rollback as an option for their X11 generation firmware.

"The SPI flash descriptor is read-only on most boards and we are helping Supermicro identify specific models where this may be incorrectly set."

## Impacted models

For owners of Supermicro server hardware, Eclypsium has released instructions on how to check the descriptor access controls of their own systems.

These procedures require installing and running the [CHIPSEC Framework](https://github.com/chipsec/chipsec), a tool co-created by one of Eclypsium founders while working for Intel. All the server owner has to do is to run the following command:

```

If this test fails, then the current descriptor values offer no protection, because they can be changed.

If an attacker were to exploit insecure firmware updates, the obvious goal would be to somehow alter the firmware. This enables very stealthy and persistent malware that can bypass many security controls. However, it may be possible to detect such malware (if it has not taken explicit steps to prevent this).

To defend against these attacks, it is possible to collect hashes of firmware modules. These can be validated against a whitelist from firmware provided by the vendor. If unexpected changes are discovered, expert analysis will be needed to manually assess them.

Bleeping Computer has sent a request for comment to Supermicro days before this article's publication. We asked Supermicro to confirm the Eclypsium research and inquired for a list of Supermicro platforms affected by the reported security issues, but we have not heard back before this article's publication time.

Until Supermicro responds or publishes an official security advisory with a list of affected models, Eclypsium CEO and Founder Yuriy Bulygin was kind enough to share with Bleeping Computer the list of Supermicro products they believe to be affected.

"For the missing UEFI update protections, it appears that a majority or all of X8, X9, X10 generation server products, and a majority of X11 generation server products are affected," Bulygin told Bleeping Computer via email. "We don’t know exact number of affected models but we found 1184 unique firmware images for at least 233 unique X8-X11 server models."

"For the flash descriptor issue we found close to 500 firmware images with this issue which translates to about 110 different models (some of them may be old). The list is below:"
