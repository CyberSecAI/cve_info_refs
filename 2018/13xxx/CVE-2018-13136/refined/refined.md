Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The identified vulnerability is a persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Persistent XSS: This means that the malicious script is stored on the server (in this case, likely within the Ultimate Member plugin) and executed when a user visits a page that displays the stored script.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts into the plugin's data that would then be executed in the browsers of other users accessing the affected pages.
- This could lead to a range of malicious activities, including:
    - Stealing cookies and session tokens.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing web pages.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user without their consent.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the Ultimate Member plugin.
- An attacker can inject malicious javascript into a field in Ultimate Member.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need the ability to interact with the plugin in a way that allows them to inject the malicious script which will be stored in the database. This might involve an attacker with some level of user permissions who can modify some configuration of the plugin or some type of data related to it.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported in version 2.0.17 of the Ultimate Member plugin and a fix was implemented in version 2.0.18 which fixed "Fixed XSS at wp-admin settings screen".
