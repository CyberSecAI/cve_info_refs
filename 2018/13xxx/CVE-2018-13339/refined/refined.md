Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the improper handling of user-supplied HTML content by the Redactor 3 plugin, specifically when using the HTML mode of the editor. The plugin does not adequately sanitize or escape HTML input, which allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the application, which is then stored in the database and executed when other users view the affected content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- When a user views content containing the malicious script, the script executes in their browser, potentially allowing the attacker to:
    - Steal session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
    - Redirect users to malicious websites.
    - Perform actions on behalf of the user.
    - Deface web pages.
    - Potentially access sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the Redactor 3 plugin's HTML editing mode.
- An attacker with content creation or editing privileges can insert the malicious HTML containing JavaScript code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to create or edit content using the vulnerable Redactor 3 plugin.
- This could be a user with specific access rights within the application that uses this plugin.
- No special position or complex capabilities are required, only access to the content editor.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in both PAGE and BLOG modules, according to the issue report on `gleez/cms`.
- The vulnerability is demonstrated in the issue on `TylerGarlick/angular-redactor` by injecting a simple `<script>alert("XSS")</script>` payload through HTML mode of the editor.
- The content mentions the vulnerability is present in the official showcase website of Redactor 3: <https://imperavi.com/redactor/>, which indicates this is a flaw within Redactor 3 itself.

This information aligns with a typical stored XSS vulnerability scenario.
