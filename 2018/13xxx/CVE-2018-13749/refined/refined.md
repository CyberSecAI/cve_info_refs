    {
      "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the mint function of a smart contract.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Integer overflow vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can mint an arbitrary large amount of tokens by exploiting the integer overflow, potentially causing inflation, and impacting the value of tokens for other users.",
      "attack_vectors": "By calling the mint function with carefully crafted input values.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to interact with the smart contract by calling the mint function. This requires having an address with which to call the contract, and knowledge of how the contract is supposed to function."
