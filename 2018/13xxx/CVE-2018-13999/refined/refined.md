- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The website's administrator panel allows the posting of articles with unsanitized input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before storing it in the database, which is later displayed to other users.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users who view the affected articles. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - An attacker, with administrator privileges, can submit an article containing malicious JavaScript code.
    - The vulnerability is triggered when a user browses the article containing the injected script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to have administrative access to the website's content management system or article publishing feature.
    - The attacker must be able to post articles through the website's admin interface.
