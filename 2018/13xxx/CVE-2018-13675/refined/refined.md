The provided content is a dump of two Github pages, one showing the directory structure of the `YAMBYO` folder within the `EtherTokens` repository, and the other showing the structure of the `GEMCHAIN` folder. The pages themselves do not contain specific vulnerability information related to a CVE. There is a file in the `YAMBYO` directory named `mint integer overflow.md`, and one in the `GEMCHAIN` folder named `mint integer overflow.md`, which suggests potential integer overflow vulnerabilities in minting functions within the EtherTokens project. However, without more specific content from these markdown files, the pages themselves are not directly related to a specific CVE.

Therefore:
