  "Impact of exploitation": "An unauthenticated attacker can obtain sensitive information about the NAS device, including its hostname, firmware version, internal IP address, MAC address, and serial number.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a POST request to the /nasapi/ endpoint with the method set to \"get_portal_info\".",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the /nasapi/ endpoint of the target NAS device."
