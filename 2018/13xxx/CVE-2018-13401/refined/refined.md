The provided content is related to CVE-2018-13401.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is an open redirect in the `XsrfErrorAction` resource of Atlassian Jira.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Open redirect vulnerability.
- The `XsrfErrorAction` resource does not properly validate the redirect URL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can obtain a user's Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) token.
- This allows an attacker to potentially perform actions on behalf of the victim user if the CSRF token is compromised.

**Attack vectors:**
- A remote attacker crafts a malicious URL that redirects to an attacker-controlled site through the vulnerable `XsrfErrorAction` resource.
- The victim user is tricked into clicking the malicious URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting that URL to exploit the open redirect and obtain their CSRF token.
