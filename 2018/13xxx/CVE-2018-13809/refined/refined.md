- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The integrated web server of the affected CP devices does not properly sanitize user input, allowing for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web server which, if executed by a victim user, could allow the attacker to perform actions with the permissions of the victim user, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker tricks an unsuspecting user into following a malicious link that contains the malicious script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious link and trick a user into clicking it. The attacker can be remote since the vulnerability is triggered over the web interface.
