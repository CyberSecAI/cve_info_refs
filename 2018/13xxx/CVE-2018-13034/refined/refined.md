Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-13034:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Jester (a web framework) handles requests for static files. Specifically, it does not properly sanitize or validate file paths requested by the user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a path traversal issue. By requesting URLs like `http://localhost:5000/../webapp.nim`, an attacker can navigate outside the intended static file directory.
*   **Inadequate Input Validation:** The framework lacks proper input sanitization, allowing attackers to use path traversal sequences (e.g., `..`) to access arbitrary files.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Access:** An attacker could potentially access any file on the server's file system, provided the application has the necessary read permissions. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, configuration files, source code, and other potentially valuable data.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The attack vector is through specially crafted HTTP requests targeting the server's static file serving functionality.
*   **Path Traversal in URL:** The attacker uses path traversal sequences (`..`) in the requested URL to move outside of the designated static directory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running the Jester application.
*   **Understanding of Path Traversal:** The attacker needs to understand path traversal techniques to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any authentication to the server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content notes that running Jester behind a reverse proxy like Nginx mitigates this vulnerability, as the proxy handles the pathing before requests reach Jester. Services like Cloudflare also offer protection.
*   The fix for this vulnerability has been backported to Jester v0.2.1 for users who do not wish to upgrade to version 0.3.0 or are on older versions of Nim.
