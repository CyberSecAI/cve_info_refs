- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A vulnerability exists in SIMATIC IT Production Suite that allows bypassing application-level authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The system has a flaw that enables an attacker to bypass authentication at the application level.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to a compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker needs network access to the affected system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have network access to the affected system and must know a valid username to the system. The exploit does not require user privileges or user interaction.
