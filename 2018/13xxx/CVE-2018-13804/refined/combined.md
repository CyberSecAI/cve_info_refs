PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC IT Production Suite is a plant-centric IT solution building the link between Business Systems
(e.g. ERP) and Control Systems.

SIMATIC IT Uniﬁed Architecture Discrete Manufacturing is designed to satisfy the most common needs of
industries with a hierarchical structure in which speciﬁc macro-areas are dedicated to executing discrete
manufacturing functionalities in various stages in order to produce the desired product. SIMATIC IT
UADM provides you with all basic functionalities for:

• Modelling your production environment, consisting in locations, machines required for production,

work operations, tools, materials, etc.

• Deﬁning how products are produced (that is, deﬁning the various operations and/or steps involved

in their production).

• Creating production orders, in which you deﬁne the type of production to be adopted and the

quantity to be produced for the order you have in mind.

• Scheduling production according to your needs.
• Tracking and monitoring production, to see how the execution of your work order is progressing.

SIMATIC IT Line Monitoring System is designed to monitor plant ﬂoor performance, blending real-time and
transactional systems, for a line visibility & control. This line-monitoring capability allows manufacturers to
increase production efﬁciency, as well as optimize performance, use reporting to their best advantage,
and reduce line inefﬁciencies, while incrementing product yields. Line Monitoring System within SIMATIC
IT allows for automatic and real-time collection of production relevant data directly from the factory ﬂoor.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.0
(CVSS v3.0) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be

individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-13804

An attacker with network access to the installation could bypass the application-level authentication.

In order to exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must obtain network access to an affected installation
and must obtain a valid username to the system.

Successful exploitation requires no user privileges and no user interaction. The vulnerability could
allow an attacker to compromise conﬁdentiality, integrity and availability of the system.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this vulnerability was known.
