- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Hardcoded API credentials (username and password) within the native library of the Android application, and lack of proper server-side security practices.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Hardcoded API credentials in the application's native library.
    - Application signature verification bypassable with a simple binary patch.
    - Plain-text storage of user passwords.
    - Lack of access controls on the API, allowing access to any user's data with the hardcoded credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Unauthorized access to sensitive user information (name, address, email, phone number, fiscal number, last 4 digits of credit card).
    - Ability to read any user's password in plain-text.
    - Potential to perform other actions allowed by the API with elevated permissions.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Reverse engineering of the Android application to extract the hardcoded API credentials.
    - Binary patching of the application to bypass signature verification and access the JNI methods
    - Direct API calls using the hardcoded credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Ability to decompile and disassemble Android applications.
    - Knowledge of binary patching.
    - Ability to make API calls.
