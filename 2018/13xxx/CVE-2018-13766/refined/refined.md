The provided content is related to a GitHub repository and does not contain specific details about CVE-2018-13766. However, one of the files in the repository is named "mint integer overflow.md". This suggests that the vulnerability is related to an integer overflow in a mint function within the context of smart contracts and blockchain security which aligns with known issues of that era.

Based on the file name, the following can be inferred:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Integer overflow in the `mint` function.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The `mint` function likely does not properly check for potential overflows when calculating the number of tokens to mint. This can result in unintended behavior.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker may be able to mint an unexpectedly large number of tokens, potentially disrupting the tokenomics.
*   **Attack vectors**: Exploiting this vulnerability involves calling the mint function with large inputs that cause an integer overflow.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to have the ability to call the mint function, which might require being a contract owner or having specific permissions.

It is important to note that this information is inferred from the file name and further analysis would be required to confirm and understand the specifics of the vulnerability.
