The provided content is related to CVE-2018-13257.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper verification of the CAS service ticket within Blackboard Learn. Specifically, Blackboard Learn fails to validate whether the service ticket is intended for the current instance.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- HTTP Host header spoofing: The vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate the host header during CAS service ticket validation.
- Insufficient service ticket verification: Blackboard Learn does not properly verify if the service ticket is meant for the current instance, which is a critical security flaw.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- User impersonation: An attacker can obtain a valid service ticket from the CAS server, then use this ticket, with a spoofed host header, to authenticate as a victim user on a Blackboard Learn instance.
- Phishing attack: A malicious website can trick users into entering their single sign-on details, then use those details to authenticate on Blackboard Learn on behalf of the user.
- Compromise of Blackboard Learn instance: If the malicious website is a trusted source (e.g., institution homepage), its compromise can lead to the compromise of the Blackboard Learn instance.

**Attack vectors:**
1. The attacker sets up a malicious website (`attacker.example`) that redirects users to the institution's CAS login page (`cas.example`).
2. The user logs in on the legitimate CAS login page and gets redirected back to the malicious website with a service ticket.
3. The malicious website then makes a request to the Blackboard Learn instance (`blackboard.example`) using the service ticket, but with the host header set to the malicious website's domain (`attacker.example`).
4. Due to insufficient validation, Blackboard Learn accepts the service ticket as valid for `attacker.example` and sends back authentication cookies to the malicious website.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to set up a malicious website that can authenticate with the same CAS server as the target Blackboard Learn instance.
- Access to a user that can successfully authenticate with the CAS server.
- Ability to perform HTTP requests with custom host headers.
