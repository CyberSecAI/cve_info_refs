The provided content describes an integer overflow vulnerability in the `mint` function of the SPX token contract, and similar vulnerabilities in other token contracts.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Integer overflow in the `mint` function, specifically when adding `value` to `totalSupply` and when updating `balances[holder]`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `mint` function in the SPX token contract uses a vulnerable check `require(totalSupply + value <= TOKEN_LIMIT)`. This check can be bypassed using a large `value` to cause an integer overflow, such that `totalSupply + value` becomes a small number that satisfies the requirement.
- Similarly, `balances[holder] += value` can also result in an integer overflow and therefore incorrect balance updates.
- Unrestricted minting by contract owner due to a bypassable check.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The contract owner can mint arbitrary amounts of tokens by exploiting the integer overflow vulnerability, bypassing the token supply limit.
- The minted tokens can be arbitrarily retrieved by the contract owner
- Incorrect user balances due to the overflow vulnerability when adding to a user's balance.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker, being the contract owner, calls the `mint` function with a large `value` that will cause an integer overflow when added to `totalSupply`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be the contract owner (or have the permissions of the `ico` address in the case of SPX and other listed tokens) to call the `mint` function.

The content provides more details than a standard CVE description by explaining the integer overflow in detail, showing how the check can be bypassed, and providing code examples and images that illustrate the process.
