The provided content is related to CVE-2018-13039.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper input sanitization in the "cari" parameter of the OpenSID application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application does not filter special characters, HTML tags, or JavaScript within the "cari" parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page through the vulnerable parameter. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to:
*   Steal user cookies.
*   Redirect users to malicious websites.
*   Potentially perform other client-side attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes the malicious script in the "cari" parameter. The user would need to click on the malicious link to trigger the XSS.
Specifically, the vulnerable URL mentioned is: `http://ip-address/index.php/first?cari=%3Cimg+src%3Dx+onerror%3Dalert%28%27XSS%27%29%3E`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload within the "cari" parameter and trick a victim into clicking on the crafted URL.
