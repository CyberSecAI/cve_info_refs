{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the `sell()` function of the smart contract.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The `sell()` function multiplies the amount of tokens being sold by the `sellPrice` to determine the amount of Ether to send to the seller. If the `sellPrice` is set to a sufficiently large value, the multiplication `amount * sellPrice` can result in an integer overflow, causing the result to wrap around to a small value or zero.",
      "The contract does not validate that the `amount * sellPrice` calculation will not result in an integer overflow."
    ],
    "impact": "When an integer overflow occurs, the seller effectively loses their tokens and receives little to no Ether in return. The contract retains both the Ether that should have been sent to the seller and the sold tokens.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The owner of the contract can set an extremely large `sellPrice` to trigger the overflow.",
      "A user sells a quantity of tokens that, when multiplied by the current sell price, causes an integer overflow."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
        "The attacker must be the owner of the contract to set a malicious sellPrice, or a user to sell the tokens.",
        "The attacker should be able to interact with the contract through the Ethereum network."
