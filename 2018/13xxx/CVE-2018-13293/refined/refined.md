- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Control Panel SSO Settings of Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a reflected XSS, where user-provided input is not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of arbitrary web script or HTML.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful attack can allow a remote authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions. The impact includes limited confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a malicious crafted URL, where the URL parameter is not sanitized.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a remote user with high privileges (PR:H) to access the vulnerable Control Panel SSO Settings. The user interaction is required for the exploit to work (UI:R) in order to inject the malicious code via a crafted URL that a victim clicks.
