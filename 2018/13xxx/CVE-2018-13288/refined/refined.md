- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the `folder_path` and `real_path` parameters within the `SYNO.FolderSharing.List` function in Synology File Station.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information exposure vulnerability due to the lack of proper input sanitization/validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can obtain sensitive information by exploiting the vulnerable parameters.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through network requests by manipulating the `folder_path` or `real_path` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the affected Synology File Station service. No prior authentication is needed.
