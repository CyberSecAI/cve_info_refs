The provided content is related to CVE-2018-13316.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper input sanitization of the `subnet` parameter in the `formAliasIP` form, allowing for command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command injection vulnerability in the `formAliasIP` via the `subnet` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can execute arbitrary system commands on the router.
- The provided example creates a file in the `/tmp` directory.
- It is noted that injecting `reboot now` can permanently brick the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited via an HTTP POST request to `/boafrm/formAliasIP`.
- The `subnet` parameter is injected with shell commands delimited by backticks `` ` ``.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface, which likely requires network access to the router.
-  The attacker does not need to be authenticated due to the lack of proper session tokens.
