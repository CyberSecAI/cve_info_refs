- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Password hashes with insufficient computational effort allow an attacker to reconstruct passwords.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of weak password hashing within project files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with local access to a project file can reconstruct certain passwords stored in the project.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to a project file. No user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs local access to the project file.
