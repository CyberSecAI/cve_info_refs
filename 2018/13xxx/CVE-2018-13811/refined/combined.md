WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict network access to the engineering station and project storage to trusted sources.

• Restrict access to project ﬁles on the engineering station and project storage to trusted users.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC STEP 7 (TIA Portal) is an engineering software to conﬁgure and program SIMATIC controllers.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.0
(CVSS v3.0) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s

environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-13811

Password hashes with insufﬁcient computational effort could allow an attacker to access to a project
ﬁle and reconstruct passwords.

The vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with local access to the project ﬁle. No user
interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability. The vulnerability could allow the attacker to obtain
certain passwords from the project.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this vulnerability was known.
