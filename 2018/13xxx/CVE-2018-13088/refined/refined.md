- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer overflow in the `mintToken` function of the TokenERC20 smart contract.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - The `mintToken` function adds `mintedAmount` to `balanceOf[target]` and `totalSupply` without checking for overflows.
    - `balanceOf` and `totalSupply` are defined as `uint256` which can cause an integer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - The contract owner can arbitrarily mint tokens, causing inflation.
    - The contract owner can cause an integer overflow in the `balanceOf` mapping, effectively setting the user's balance to 0.
    - An attacker can manipulate the balance of any user by minting a large number of tokens, causing an overflow, then set the balance to arbitrary value by minting it again.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Calling the `mintToken` function with a large `mintedAmount`.
    - The attacker needs to be the owner of the contract.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must be the owner of the smart contract.
