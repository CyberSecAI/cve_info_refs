- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer overflow in the `mintToken` function due to using unsigned integers (`uint256`) for balance and total supply calculations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Integer overflow vulnerability in the `mintToken` function. Specifically, the addition operations `balanceOf[target] += mintedAmount` and `totalSupply += mintedAmount` can overflow, leading to unexpected results.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker, specifically the contract owner, can arbitrarily manipulate the balance of any user by repeatedly minting large amounts of tokens. This could lead to a user's balance being reset to zero due to the overflow. The contract owner can also mint tokens without any control on the total supply of tokens.
- **Attack vectors:** The `mintToken` function. The contract owner calls the vulnerable function, passing an arbitrary target address and a large value for the minted amount.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be the contract owner since the `mintToken` function has the `onlyOwner` modifier.
