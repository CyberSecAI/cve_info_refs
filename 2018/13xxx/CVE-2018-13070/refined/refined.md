The content is related to CVE-2018-13070.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Integer overflow in the `mintToken` function of the `EncryptedToken` smart contract.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `mintToken` function uses unchecked addition (`+=`) to update `balanceOf` and `totalSupply`.  Since these are `uint256` types, an integer overflow can occur.
- The contract does not use SafeMath library.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The contract owner can mint an arbitrary amount of tokens to any user.
- By repeatedly minting a large amount of tokens, the contract owner can cause an integer overflow, setting a user's balance to zero.
- The owner can manipulate balances arbitrarily by leveraging the integer overflow.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to be the owner of the contract.
- The attacker calls the `mintToken` function with large values for `mintedAmount`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Must be the owner of the smart contract.
- Needs to be able to execute contract functions.
