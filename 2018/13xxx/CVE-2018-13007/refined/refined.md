The content is related to CVE-2018-13007.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a heap buffer overflow in the `GPMF_Next` function within `GPMF_parser.c`. Specifically, the issue lies in how the code handles nested data structures and end-of-structure markers (GPMF_KEY_END), leading to out-of-bounds reads.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap buffer overflow: The `GPMF_Next` function attempts to access memory outside of the allocated buffer when parsing nested data structures.
- Out-of-bounds read: Specifically at line 260, 266 and 277 in `GPMF_parser.c`

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The heap overflow can cause the program to crash due to a segmentation fault or other memory access errors. It can potentially also lead to arbitrary code execution.
- The provided ASan report shows a heap-buffer-overflow read, which causes the program to abort.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when parsing a specially crafted GPMF data structure within an MP4 file. The provided sample file `karma.mp4` can trigger the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is triggered by crafted GPMF data containing nested structures with an incorrect number of end markers, leading the code to read beyond allocated memory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a crafted MP4 file containing a malformed GPMF data structure that triggers the overflow in the `GPMF_Next` function.
- The attacker would likely need to have some knowledge of the GPMF data structure format to be able to craft such an attack payload.
