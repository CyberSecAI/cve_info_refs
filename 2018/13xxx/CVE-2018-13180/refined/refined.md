The provided content includes two GitHub pages, neither of which contain information about a specific CVE. However, one of the pages links to a file named `mint integer overflow.md`, which suggests the presence of an integer overflow vulnerability.

Based on the filename `mint integer overflow.md` it is likely related to integer overflow during the minting process of tokens. However, without the contents of the file itself there is no way to know for sure if it is the cause of the vulnerability related to CVE-2018-13180.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I would respond with:

NOINFO
