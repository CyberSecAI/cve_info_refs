##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

### 7.9  (build [#70900001](#v70900001 "7.9 - build #70900001")) – released 2021-10-12

You can now securely share virtually any 1Password item with anyone – even if they don't use 1Password! 🎉

To get started, open the share menu and select "Share" to generate a link, specify who you want to share the item with and for how long, then send out the link however you wish. It's as simple as copy and paste, without the security risks that come from pasting sensitive info directly into chat and email. 😱

Use it to send logins to an external contractor, share the Wi-Fi password with your visiting in-laws, or pass a Secure Note to your partner.

Happy sharing! 🥳🎊

#### New

* Adds support for external item sharing: share almost any 1Password item with specific people, or anyone with the share link.

Check out the splash screen animation and privacy dashboard integrations on Android 12.

## Save on paper clips

You can now attach files directly to items in your 1Password account. Snap a photo of your license and add it to your Driver License item. Include a picture of your vaccination card with a Medical Record item. Do the same for credit cards, passports, and more!

### 7.7  (build [#70700009](#v70700009 "7.7 - build #70700009")) – released 2020-09-09

Now that Android 11 has officially arrived, we've updated 1Password to embrace the best of Google's newest release! Autofill your Logins from the Gboard suggestion strip in supported apps and browsers. Fine tune which files 1Password has access to when setting up local storage sync. And keep work and play separate with improved support for work profiles.

## May we suggest Autofill?

The keyboard suggestion strip is a conveniently located place to offer helpful access to things like the clipboard and emoji. Android 11 and Gboard take it a step further by including support for displaying Autofill results in the suggestion strip as well. When using Autofill with 1Password in supported apps and browsers, your Login items will now be displayed above the keyboard instead of in a dropdown menu, keeping the rest of your screen free of clutter.

## File it under privacy

Android 11 includes more granular control over which files an app can access and gives you the ability to revoke that access at any time. 1Password now supports these enhanced protections by making use of the system file picker both when setting up local storage sync and when restoring access later.

## Ready for work and play

In addition to the improvements specific to Android 11, we've also added support for allowing your workplace administrator to configure security settings for 1Password in your work profile. Your administrator can now set requirements for biometrics, PIN code, and Master Password timeout according to your workplace policies.

We hope you enjoy this release and look forward to your feedback on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.agilebits.onepassword), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/1Password), and in the [1Password forums](https://discussions.agilebits.com/categories/1password-android)!

#### New

* Enjoy using 1Password with full compatibility for the latest changes in Android 11. {1228}
* See your Autofill results conveniently displayed in the suggestion strip above supported keyboards on Android 11. {1234}
* Use 1Password with a work profile and have your IT admin configure requirements for biometrics, PIN codes, and Master Password timeout values. {1223}
* Use the system file picker to set up local storage sync with support for scoped storage permissions on Android 11. {19}
* Set up local storage sync with ease using the new vault picker interface for easily selecting the right standalone vault. {1088}
* Easily restore access to a vault in local storage if you accidentally revoke access permissions. {1147}
* Enjoy the convenience of using Autofill with 1Password while testing the latest features in the Brave Nightly browser. {1248}

#### Improvements

* Added support for using Autofill with apps that are built with Flutter. {1264}
* Added support for Accessibility-based filling in the new version of Firefox that is now rolling out. {1261}
* Updated Autofill to support the latest version of Firefox Nightly. {1283}

* Updated localizations from our fantastic translators on Crowdin. {1211}

#### Fixed

* Watchtower alerts weren't triggered for subdomains of affected websites. {1173}
* Watchtower notifications were sometimes pushed without an item first having been added to Watchtower. {1227}
* The 1Password Accessibility service wouldn't fill into apps and browsers on Android 11 devices. {1250}
* Toast messages weren't themed correctly on devices running Android 11. {1249}
* A crash could occur when attempting to select a standalone vault from the system file picker. {1239}

### 7.5  (build [#70500009](#v70500009 "7.5 - build #70500009")) – released 2020-03-24

1Password has learned a few new moves in this latest edition! You can now send your family or team members a link that will open directly to that shared item. Beautify your notes using Markdown formatting to keep them legible and organized. Sort your items by name, date, title and more to quickly find what you are looking for.

## Share links to items

Point family or team members in the right direction with a link to an item that you've shared with them. Instead of sending them searching for items by name and vault, you can simply send them a link that will open the item with a single tap. No more looking for that needle in the haystack!

## Style notes with Markdown

Easily style your notes to include headings, lists, and text formatting using Markdown. From adding a short note in one of your Login items to drafting your next blog post in a Secure Note, Markdown formatting is here to help keep things legible and tidy.

## Sort items in any list

Whether you're searching or browsing, viewing all your items or just the ones in a specific category, you can now sort your items by name, date, type and more. Sort by date modified when you want to track down those items you've recently created or the ones you haven't updated in a while. Choose password strength when it's time to find the weakest links in your security chain and make them stronger.

We hope you enjoy these latest additions as much as we enjoyed building them for you! Share your feedback with us on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.agilebits.onepassword), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/1Password), and in the [1Password forums](https://discussions.agilebits.com/categories/1password-android).

### 7.4  (build [#70400009](#v70400009 "7.4 - build #70400009")) – released 2020-01-30

We’re delivering a blend of features in this update that enhance both ease of use and security. You can now create new vaults to organize your items while on the go. When signing into websites and apps, you can preview the Logins available for autofill. And you can use your security key as a second factor when signing in to your 1Password account.

## Build it up

Having multiple vaults helps you to keep everything in its right place. That's easier than ever now that you can create a new vault while on the go! With a few taps in the vault menu, you can create a brand new vault with its own custom icon, ready to securely store your latest secrets.

## See the sites

Signing into websites and apps is even easier now that you can see which Logins are available to autofill without first having to unlock 1Password. After selecting the Login, you'll be prompted to unlock 1Password if needed before the Login is autofilled for you. Turn on Autofill previews in Settings > Autofill to start enjoying this feature now!

## Lock it down

You can now protect your 1Password account with an additional layer of security. After enabling two-factor authentication on 1Password.com and adding a hardware security key to your account, you will prompted to provide your security key whenever you sign in to your account on an Android device.

We hope you love this update as much as we've loved building it for you! Be sure to let us know on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.agilebits.onepassword), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/1Password), and in the [1Password forums](https://discussions.agilebits.com/categories/1password-android).

We've enhanced your 1Password experience with a great set of new features in this update. With baked-in support for Dark Theme, a more convenient way to create new Login items as you need them, and full control over your trashed items, you may have trouble picking your one favourite new thing!

## Paint it black

Whether you're seeking to reduce the drain on your battery or the strain on your eyes, you can now embrace the darker side of 1Password with our newly styled Dark Theme. By default, 1Password will automatically switch to Dark Theme when you choose it in your system settings or battery saver is enabled. Or if you prefer, you can manually select the theme of your choice from the display settings in 1Password.

## Create on the fly

When using Autofill with 1Password, you can now create new Login items for apps and websites without having to first return to the main app. Easily get credentials out of your head and into 1Password for your existing accounts. And when it comes to creating credentials for new accounts, you can use the built-in Strong Password Generator to ensure that those accounts stay secure.

## Take out the trash

You can manage your trashed items on your Android device with the new Trashed category in 1Password. Upon reviewing your trashed items, you can restore any items that you may have accidentally moved to the trash. You can then empty the trash to delete any items that you no longer need, allowing you to keep your vaults tidy and clutter free.

We hope you love this update as much as we've loved building it for you! We look forward to your feedback on Google Play, Twitter, and in the 1Password Forums.
