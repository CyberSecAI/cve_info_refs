- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Command injection vulnerability in the `ftpd` service within Synology Router Manager (SRM).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The ftpd service fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input passed through the MKD or RMD commands. This allows for command injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote authenticated attacker can execute arbitrary operating system commands on the affected device.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker must be on the network and authenticated with the device. They would then inject malicious commands through either the MKD or RMD FTP commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a remote, authenticated user on the network.
