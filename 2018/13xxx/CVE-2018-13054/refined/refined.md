Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-13054:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `cinnamon-settings-users.py` GUI, which runs as root, allows configuration of user icon files. It writes these icon files to the respective user's `$HOME/.face` location.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Symlink Attack:** An unprivileged user can create a symbolic link (symlink) at their `$HOME/.face` location, pointing to an arbitrary file or directory on the system.
*   **Unvalidated File Write:** When the admin changes the user's icon through the GUI, the root process will write the new icon data to the location pointed to by the symlink without proper checks, overwriting the linked file/directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** An attacker can overwrite any file on the filesystem that the root user has write access to.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Overwriting system configuration files can cause system instability and denial of service.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Indirect):** By overwriting specific files, such as `/etc/suid-debug`, the attacker might weaken the security of setuid binaries, potentially leading to privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Local access is required to create the symlink.
*   The vulnerability is triggered through the `cinnamon-settings-users.py` GUI.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must be a local unprivileged user on the system.
*   The attacker needs a user account on the system
*   An administrator must interact with the vulnerable application to trigger the file overwrite.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Cinnamon versions 1.9.2 through 3.8.6.
*   The file content being written is not directly controlled by the attacker but is the icon file chosen by the admin, which is less severe than arbitrary content.
*   The fix involves dropping privileges to the target user's before writing to .face files, ensuring that the operation is subject to the target user's permissions, preventing the symlink attack.
*   A subsequent fix was implemented to address the issue where the original fix caused problems when overwriting existing .face files.
