The provided content relates to CVE-2018-13206.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer overflow in the `sell()` function of the smart contract.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `sell()` function calculates the amount of Ether to send to the seller by multiplying the number of tokens being sold (`amount`) by the `sellPrice`.
- This multiplication is performed without checking for potential integer overflows.
- If the `sellPrice` is set to a large value and the `amount` is also a large value, the result of the multiplication `amount * sellPrice` can overflow, resulting in a much smaller value than expected (or even zero).
- This smaller value is then used to send Ether to the seller.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A user selling tokens would receive significantly less Ether than they should or even no ether, while losing their tokens.
- The contract would retain the ETH that should have been sent to the user. This could lead to an imbalance in the contract and potential loss of funds for users.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker, who is also the owner of the contract, could set the `sellPrice` to a high value, causing the integer overflow in the `sell()` function, leading to a loss of funds to the seller.
- The vulnerability is present in the smart contract's function, which is accessible to anyone who interacts with the contract.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be the owner of the smart contract with the ability to set the `sellPrice`. They also can be a user selling their tokens.
- The attacker must be able to interact with the smart contract through its public interface.
