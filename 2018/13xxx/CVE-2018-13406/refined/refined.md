{
  "CVE-2018-13406": {
    "Root cause": "Integer overflow in the uvesafb driver when allocating memory for color map entries.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (crash) or privilege escalation by a user with permission to access the uvesafb device.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access to the uvesafb device"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A local user with permission to access the uvesafb device can trigger the integer overflow when setting the color map via the uvesafb driver ioctl. This allows the attacker to cause a denial of service, by crashing the system, or potentially escalate privileges via memory corruption."
