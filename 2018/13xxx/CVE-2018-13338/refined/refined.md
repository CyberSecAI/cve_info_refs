The provided content relates to CVE-2018-13338.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization when creating a new user. The application uses a command line tool, and the username parameter is passed to this tool. An attacker can inject arbitrary commands by using backticks (` `) in the username field, leading to command execution on the system.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- System Command Injection

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary commands can be executed as the root user on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a crafted POST request to the `/include/ajax/ajaxdata.php` endpoint during user creation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint, which is usually available on the local network where the NAS is hosted. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
