{
  "CVE-2018-13053": {
    "description": "The alarmtimer implementation in the Linux kernel contained an integer overflow vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service.",
    "root_cause": "The `alarm_timer_nsleep()` function uses `ktime_add()` to add the current time and the relative expiry value, which can overflow when the relative timeout is large enough, leading to the alarm not firing or a denial of service.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Integer overflow in the alarmtimer implementation"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service, where the alarm doesn't fire.",
    "attack_vector": "A local attacker can trigger the integer overflow by requesting a large relative timeout when using nanosleep.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "A local attacker with the ability to call nanosleep with a sufficiently large relative timeout."
