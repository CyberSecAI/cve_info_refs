Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-13389:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Atlassian Confluence handles attachments with the `application/rdf+xml` content type, which can be exploited to perform content spoofing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Content Spoofing:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to spoof web content by manipulating the content of an attachment, specifically when the attachment's content type is `application/rdf+xml`.
- **Lack of Proper Handling:** The application doesn't properly handle or sanitize the content of `application/rdf+xml` attachments before rendering them in the browser, specifically in Mozilla Firefox.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Content Spoofing:** Attackers could potentially trick users into believing that they are interacting with legitimate content from the Confluence instance, while actually interacting with attacker-controlled content.
- **Potential for Phishing:** The spoofed content could be used to conduct phishing attacks by mimicking login pages or other sensitive areas of the application.
- **Manipulation of UI:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate the user interface or content of the Confluence page within the user's browser window.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Attachment Upload:** An attacker uploads a crafted file with a content type of `application/rdf+xml` to an Atlassian Confluence instance.
- **User Access:** When a user accesses or views the attachment, the crafted content is rendered by the Firefox browser, resulting in the content spoofing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Confluence:** An attacker needs to have the ability to upload attachments to a Confluence instance. This may require having an account or exploiting another vulnerability that allows this access.
- **Knowledge of Content Types:** The attacker needs to know that the content type `application/rdf+xml` is processed in a way that allows content spoofing in Mozilla Firefox.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Versions:** Atlassian Confluence versions before 6.6.1 are vulnerable.
- **Fix Versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in versions 6.6.1 and 6.7.0.
- **Browser Specific:** This issue is specific to Mozilla Firefox.
- **Severity:** The issue is rated as "Severity 2 - Major" with a "Medium" priority.
- **Similar Issue:** The issue is related to CVE-2017-18103, which involves content spoofing through the `application/mathml+xml` content type in Firefox.
