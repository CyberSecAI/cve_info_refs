The provided content includes detailed information about multiple vulnerabilities in TerraMaster TOS 3.1.03, including CVE-2018-13353.

**CVE-2018-13353:**

*   **Root Cause:** System command injection vulnerability in the `checkport` function of the `ajaxdata.php` endpoint.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Insufficient input sanitization/validation: The `checkport` function directly uses user-supplied input in a system command without proper sanitization.
    *   Lack of privilege separation: Although the request can be initiated by a low-privileged user, the command executes as root.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution as root, leading to full system compromise.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted POST request to the `ajaxdata.php` endpoint with a malicious payload in the `checkport` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web interface of the TerraMaster device (no authentication required).
