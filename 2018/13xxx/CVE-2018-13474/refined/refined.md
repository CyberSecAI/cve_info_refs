The provided content consists of two HTML documents that appear to be GitHub pages. Both documents contain navigation menus, product information, and links to various GitHub features. However, neither document contains specific details related to a CVE, especially not CVE-2018-13474.

Based on the filenames found in the second document (`mint integer overflow.md`), it's likely the repository `BlockChainsSecurity/EtherTokens` contains information about integer overflow vulnerabilities, but the content of these pages is just navigation and metadata, and not the vulnerability details themselves.

Therefore, the provided documents do not contain any useful information about CVE-2018-13474.
