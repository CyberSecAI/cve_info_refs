Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of security-related fixes in ABBYY FlexiCapture 12 Release 1 Update 7:

**1.1 Broken Access Control**
*   **Vulnerability:** The `POST` request `/FlexiCapture12/Login/Server/SevaUserProfile` was using a parameter called `FlexiCaptureTmsSts2` which is no longer required.
*   **Weakness:** The application was not correctly validating or requiring the parameter.
*  **Impact:** While the behavior of the web application was not affected, it implies that there may be other issues with validation of parameters.
*   **Attack vector:** A malicious actor could potentially manipulate this request.
*   **Required capabilities:** The attacker would need to be able to make `POST` requests to the application

**1.2 Cross-Site Request Forgery**
*   **Vulnerability:** The application was vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of CSRF protection.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could potentially make requests on behalf of an authenticated user.
*   **Attack vector:**  CSRF attacks on web applications including Web Verification, Web Scanning, Web Capture, Monitoring and Administration, Login.
*   **Required capabilities:** An attacker would need to trick a logged-in user to make a malicious request.
*   **Fix:** Implemented the ASP.NET MVC AntiForgeryToken mechanism, and validation for POST requests.

**1.3 Weak Password Policy**
*   **Vulnerability:**  The application had a weak password policy that did not comply with Microsoft standards.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of complexity requirements for user passwords.
*   **Impact:**  Users were able to create weak passwords, making them vulnerable to compromise.
*   **Attack vector:** Password guessing attacks
*   **Required capabilities:** An attacker would need access to the application's authentication mechanism.
*    **Fix:** The password policy has been updated to require upper and lower case English letters, as well as Arabic numerals or special characters.

**1.4 User Impersonation Allowed Privilege Escalation**
*   **Vulnerability:** A user with basic authentication could open a session with administrator role.
*   **Weakness:** The application was not correctly validating the user's permissions and station type when opening a session.
*   **Impact:** A basic user could escalate to admin privileges.
*   **Attack vector:** A malicious user could try to open session with administrator role even if they do not have the right permissions.
*   **Required capabilities:** Basic authentication access to the application
*   **Note:** The document claims "Not an issue", however, based on the description, this seems to be a vulnerability that is being addressed.

**1.5 Clear Text Data Transmission (ABBY-014-2-2)**
*   **Vulnerability:** The application was transmitting data in clear text using HTTP.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of enforcement of HTTPS.
*   **Impact:** Data transmitted between client and server is vulnerable to interception.
*  **Attack vector:** Man-in-the-middle attacks
*   **Required capabilities:** Ability to intercept network traffic
*   **Note:** The document says this is not an issue as the application relies on administrator setting up HTTPS, but it also acknowledges the vulnerability.

**1.6 No Account Lockout**
*   **Vulnerability:** The application did not lock user accounts after multiple failed login attempts.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of account lockout mechanism.
*   **Impact:** Users were vulnerable to brute force attacks on login
*   **Attack vector:** Brute force attacks on user passwords
*   **Required capabilities:** An attacker would need access to the application login mechanism.
*    **Fix:** A counter was added to track login attempts and lock accounts after multiple failures.
