The content is related to CVE-2018-13026.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `GPMF_Type` function within the `GPMF_parser.c` file at line 528.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability is present due to an out-of-bounds read. Specifically, the code attempts to read 4 bytes from a memory location that is just beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploitation can lead to a crash due to memory corruption, which is evidenced by the AddressSanitizer report and the program aborting. It could potentially be exploited for more severe impacts such as arbitrary code execution, though that is not explicitly mentioned or proven in this report.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves processing a specially crafted GPMF data stream that causes the out-of-bounds read in the `GPMF_Type` function. This crafted data is parsed by the `GPMF_parser` library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to be able to supply a malformed or specifically crafted GPMF (GoPro Metadata Format) data stream to the vulnerable code. The attacker needs the ability to trigger the `GPMF_Type` function with data that will cause the out-of-bounds memory read. The provided Proof of Concept (POC) file suggests that an attacker could achieve this by providing a malformed input file processed by the `gpmf-parser`.
