  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the minting process of a smart contract.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow vulnerability in the minting function"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can mint an excessive amount of tokens by exploiting the integer overflow, potentially leading to a significant inflation of the token supply.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting a large number as input to the minting function that causes an integer overflow",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to call the minting function with a crafted input. This can be done via interacting with the smart contract's function call."
