Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2018-13331:

**CVE-2018-13331: Persistent Cross-site Scripting via username in Control Panel**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation and sanitization when creating a user. Specifically, the username field allows for the injection of HTML tags, which are then stored persistently.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input, specifically the username during user creation.
    *   **Persistent XSS:** The injected HTML/JavaScript payload is stored in the system and executed every time the user list is viewed in the Control Panel.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when the user list in the Control Panel is viewed. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker crafts a malicious username containing HTML/JavaScript (e.g., `<img src=a onerror=alert(document.cookie)>`) and creates a new user with this malicious username.
    *   When an administrator views the list of users in the Control Panel, the injected JavaScript payload executes.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to create a user on the TerraMaster device. This typically requires some level of access to the system.
