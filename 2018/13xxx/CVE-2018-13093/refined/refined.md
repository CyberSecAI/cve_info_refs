```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A NULL pointer dereference may occur for a corrupted xfs image after xfs_da_shrink_inode() is called with a NULL bp. This occurs because of a lack of proper validation that cached inodes are free during an allocation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "NULL pointer dereference",
      "Insufficient validation of cached inodes"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A system crash and denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "Mounting a specially crafted XFS filesystem image.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Requires the ability to mount a crafted XFS filesystem. This is typically a privileged action, although an attacker could potentially trick a regular user into mounting a malicious image (e.g. via an auto-mounted USB drive)."
