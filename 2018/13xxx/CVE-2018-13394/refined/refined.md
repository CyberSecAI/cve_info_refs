Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-13394:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of CSRF protection in the `acceptAnswer` resource of the Confluence Questions app. This allows an attacker to forge requests on behalf of a user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): The application does not properly validate the origin of requests to the `acceptAnswer` resource, allowing an attacker to make unauthorized requests on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can force a user to accept an answer to a question within Confluence Questions. While the severity is labeled as "Minor," this could have implications in specific scenarios, potentially disrupting workflows or manipulating information within the Confluence environment.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is a crafted HTTP request triggered by a user's browser (typically through a malicious link or website) while they are authenticated to the vulnerable Confluence instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in Confluence user to visit a crafted webpage that sends a forged request to the vulnerable Confluence server.  The attacker does not need to be authenticated to Confluence, but they need to know the URL to trigger the acceptAnswer action.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in Atlassian Confluence Questions before version 2.6.6
- The bundled version of Confluence Questions was fixed in Confluence version 6.9.0
- The issue is labeled as a "Bug" with a "Low" priority
- The security issue is tagged with `csrf`, `cvss-low` and `security`
- The issue is said to affect both Cloud and Server deployments
