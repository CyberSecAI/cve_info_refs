Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-13055:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the use of `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` in the `filter_form_api.php` file, specifically in the `filter_form_draw_inputs` function. This variable is used to construct a URL for filter options.
- The `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` variable is vulnerable to manipulation through the PATH_INFO component of the URL, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary code via a crafted URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page, which will be executed by the victim's browser.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` variable was not being sanitized before being used in the HTML output, leading to the XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** If the Content Security Policy (CSP) settings on the MantisBT instance permit it, a successful exploit can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- **Account Hijacking:** An attacker could potentially use the XSS vulnerability to steal cookies or session tokens, leading to account hijacking.
- **Malicious Actions:** The attacker could perform actions on behalf of the victim, such as modifying data or creating new users.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network-based Attack:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted URL to the MantisBT server.
- **URI-based Parameter:** The malicious payload is injected through the PATH_INFO component of the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker does not need local access to the server, can exploit the vulnerability remotely by sending a crafted request.
- **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to construct a malicious URL with the XSS payload.
- **No privileges required:** No special privileges or authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability.
- **User interaction required:** The user needs to click on the crafted link or visit the malicious URL.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was introduced as part of a Filter API refactoring in MantisBT 2.1.0
- The fix involves sanitizing the output of `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` using the `string_sanitize_url()` function before it is displayed on the page.
- The vulnerable code is in the file `core/filter_form_api.php`, specifically the function `filter_form_draw_inputs`.
- The vulnerability is present in MantisBT versions 2.1.0 through 2.15.0 and is fixed in version 2.15.1.
- The vulnerability was reported by Ömer Çıtak, a Security Researcher at Netsparker (now Invicti).
