  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the mint function of the GEMCHAIN smart contract.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Integer overflow vulnerability in smart contract mint function."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could mint a large number of tokens by exploiting the integer overflow, leading to excessive token creation and potentially devaluing the token.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "By sending a crafted transaction with a large number of tokens to mint, exploiting the lack of proper bounds checking in the mint function."
      ],
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send transactions to the contract, meaning they must be interacting with the smart contract on the blockchain."
