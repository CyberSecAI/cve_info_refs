- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Uncontrolled resource consumption in the TLS configuration of Synology MailPlus Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from how the server handles client-initiated renegotiation during TLS handshakes.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the affected server.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is carried out remotely via the network. Attackers can trigger the vulnerability by initiating TLS renegotiation requests to the MailPlus Server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be unauthenticated and requires network access to the vulnerable MailPlus Server instance.
