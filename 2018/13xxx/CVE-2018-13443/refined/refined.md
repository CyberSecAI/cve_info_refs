{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `WAST::lex()` function due to a lack of boundary checks when incrementing the `nextToken` pointer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-buffer-overflow",
      "Lack of boundary checks"
    ],
    "impact": "The heap overflow can lead to code execution. Specifically, when `nextToken` pointer goes out of bounds, it can overwrite the metadata of `lineStarts`, causing a `realloc(): invalid old size` error. By overflowing the buffer, an attacker may be able to control the subsequent memory allocation, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafting a specific input that causes the `nextToken` pointer to go out of bounds during the tokenization process in the `WAST::lex()` function."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to supply input to the vulnerable `WAST::lex()` function to trigger the overflow."
