- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A relative path traversal vulnerability exists in the Attachment Uploader of Synology Calendar.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows for arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient validation of the filename parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote authenticated user can upload arbitrary files, potentially leading to malicious file execution, data modification, or other forms of unauthorized access or control. However, the CVSS score suggests only a low impact on integrity, and no impact on confidentiality and availability.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N) and requires a low level of privileges (PR:L) with no user interaction (UI:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be a remote user with valid authentication credentials for Synology Calendar.
