Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commit:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically within SQL queries. The commit message "FIX SQL Injections reported by mu shcor (ADLab of Venustech)" indicates that the code was vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where malicious SQL code can be injected through user-provided parameters. This is indicated by changes in `htdocs/main.inc.php` adding additional checks for SQL injection and `htdocs/core/class/html.form.class.php` sanitizing input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability could lead to:

- **Data Breach:** Attackers could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database.
- **Data Modification/Deletion:** Malicious actors could modify or delete data.
- **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, SQL injection could allow an attacker to gain administrative privileges.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Resource-intensive queries could be injected to slow down or crash the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector is primarily through HTTP GET and POST parameters, which are not properly validated before being used in SQL queries. Specifically:

- `htdocs/core/class/html.form.class.php`: The `select_thirdparty_list` function uses a `$filter` variable that is now sanitized using `test_sql_and_script_inject()` to prevent SQL injection.
- `htdocs/product/card.php`:  This file shows sanitization of various parameters like `customcode`, `country_id`, `finished`, `fk_unit`, `accountancy_code_sell`, `accountancy_code_sell_intra`, `accountancy_code_sell_export`, and `accountancy_code_buy`.
- `htdocs/societe/ajax/company.php`: The `select_thirdparty_list` function is used in an ajax context, and calls the sanitized version.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP GET or POST requests to the vulnerable web application.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable parameters:** They would also need to identify the specific parameters that are vulnerable to SQL injection.
- **No Authentication (Potentially):** Depending on the specific vulnerability, it is possible that no authentication is needed.

**Technical Details:**

- **`htdocs/core/class/html.form.class.php`:** The code adds sanitization using `test_sql_and_script_inject()` to the `$filter` parameter within the `select_thirdparty_list()` function to avoid injection in the underlying query.
- **`htdocs/main.inc.php`:** The `test_sql_and_script_inject()` function is modified. It adds a check for `$type == 3` which provides more strict filtering of SQL keywords. The function also gains more checks on parameters passed through `POST`.
- **`htdocs/product/card.php`:** This file changes how GET parameters are handled. Instead of directly using the value obtained from the GET request, the parameters are now filtered. For example, `GETPOST('customcode')` becomes `GETPOST('customcode','alpha')`. This suggests type checking or additional validation is occurring. Various parameters that are related to strings (`alpha`), integers (`int`), and alphanumeric (`aZ09`) are now filtered.
- **`htdocs/societe/ajax/company.php`:** Uses the sanitized function `select_thirdparty_list` from the form class.

The commit also indicates that additional sanitization was added, such as preventing directory traversal vulnerabilities: `(\.\.%2f)+`.
