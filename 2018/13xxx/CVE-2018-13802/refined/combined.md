### 3.4 RESEARCHER

Siemens reported these vulnerabilities to NCCIC.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Siemens recommends users update to the new version (v2.12.1) as soon as possible. This version can be found at the following location on the Siemens website:

<https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/us/en/view/109760683>

To reduce risk, Siemens recommends that administrators restrict network access to prevent potential attackers from accessing Port 22/TCP, if possible.

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for industrial security (<https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security>), and following the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at:

<https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity>

For more information on these vulnerabilities and detailed instructions, please see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-493830 at the following location:

<http://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories/>

NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS-CERT website](/ics/) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

SUMMARY

The latest update for ROX II ﬁxes two vulnerabilities. One vulnerability could allow an attacker with
a low-privileged user account to execute arbitrary commands. The other vulnerability could allow an
attacker with a low-privileged user account to escalate his privileges.

Siemens recommends to update to the new version as soon as possible.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict network access to prevent potential attackers from accessing 22/tcp if possible

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

ROX-based VPN endpoints and ﬁrewall devices are used to connect devices that operate in harsh
environments such as electric utility substations and trafﬁc control cabinets.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.0
(CVSS v3.0) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s

environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-13801

An attacker with network access to port 22/tcp and valid low-privileged user credentials for the target
device could perform a privilege escalation and gain root privileges.

Successful exploitation requires user privileges of a low-privileged user but no user interaction. The
vulnerability could allow an attacker to compromise conﬁdentiality, integrity and availability of the
system.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-13802

An authenticated attacker with a high-privileged user account access via SSH could circumvent
restrictions in place and execute arbitrary operating system commands.

Successful exploitation requires that the attacker has network access to the SSH interface in on port
22/tcp. The attacker must be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability. The vulnerability could allow an
attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.
