Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-13802:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient restrictions on commands that can be executed by a high-privileged user via the SSH interface (Port 22/TCP) on Siemens ROX II devices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269):** The system allows a high-privileged user to bypass restrictions and execute arbitrary operating system commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Compromise:** The attacker gains full control of the system, which may compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the device and related systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the device on Port 22/TCP.
*   **SSH Interface:** The attack is performed via the SSH interface of the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must have a high-privileged user account to access the device via SSH.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to Port 22/TCP.

**Summary of CVE-2018-13802:**

CVE-2018-13802 involves a privilege management vulnerability in Siemens ROX II devices. A high-privileged attacker who gains access via SSH can circumvent existing restrictions and execute arbitrary operating system commands on the device, potentially leading to a full compromise of the system.
