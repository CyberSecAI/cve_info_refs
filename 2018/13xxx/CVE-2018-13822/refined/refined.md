- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The SSL password is being stored in plain text.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unencrypted storage of sensitive information (SSL password).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can access sensitive information (SSL password).
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker would need access to the system where the plain text SSL password is stored.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs access to the system/storage location where the unencrypted SSL password is kept.
