```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `mintToken` function in the Betcash smart contract is vulnerable to an integer overflow. The `balanceOf[target] += mintedAmount` operation can result in an overflow if `mintedAmount` is sufficiently large, wrapping the balance around to a small value.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Integer overflow in the `mintToken` function.",
    "Unrestricted minting capability by the contract owner."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The owner of the contract can arbitrarily mint large amounts of tokens to any user. Due to the integer overflow, they can also cause a user's balance to wrap around to zero, effectively controlling any user's balance to be an arbitrary value.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by calling the `mintToken` function with a large `mintedAmount`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be the owner of the Betcash contract to exploit the vulnerability.  The owner can call the `mintToken` function."
