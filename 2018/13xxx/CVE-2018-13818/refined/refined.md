{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Twig template engine, when used in a vulnerable application, does not properly sanitize user-provided input, allowing for Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI). By injecting malicious code within template syntax, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)",
      "Insufficient input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution, allowing attackers to take full control of the server, access sensitive data, or perform other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": "By injecting malicious code within template syntax in parameters via GET or POST requests.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the server with the ability to inject code within the template syntax."
