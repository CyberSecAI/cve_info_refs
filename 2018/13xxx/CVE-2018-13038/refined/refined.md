- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Unrestricted file upload in the "Artikel" (Article) feature allows uploading of arbitrary files, including PHP files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Lack of file type filtering and validation. The system does not restrict the types of files that can be uploaded, neither by extension nor by MIME type.
    - Insufficient access controls: Contributor-level users can upload files, not requiring full administrator privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Arbitrary code execution: By uploading a PHP backdoor, an attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the server.
    - Server takeover: In a worst-case scenario, an attacker can gain full control of the server by uploading a PHP backdoor and leveraging it.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - File upload functionality in the article attachment feature.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to have contributor access to the system.
    - The attacker needs to craft a malicious PHP file to upload.
    - The attacker needs to be able to navigate to the article where the attachment is located and click the download link to execute the malicious php.
