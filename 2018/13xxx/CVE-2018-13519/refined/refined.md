The provided content does not contain information about CVE-2018-13519, however it references a file called `mint integer overflow.md` which is a common vulnerability in smart contracts.

The content references a github repository `BlockChainsSecurity/EtherTokens` and includes links to `DigitalCloudToken/mint integer overflow.md` and `GEMCHAIN/mint%20integer%20overflow.md`. The file name `mint integer overflow.md` suggests the presence of integer overflow vulnerability within the mint function of the smart contract. The content also includes navigation menus and project details unrelated to the vulnerability, but the filenames point to the existence of an integer overflow vulnerability.

Based on the file names:
- Root cause of vulnerability: Integer overflow in the mint function
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Integer overflow.
- Impact of exploitation:  An attacker can mint an arbitrary amount of tokens which they control which can lead to inflation and/or the ability to exploit contracts that rely on the token, potentially leading to financial loss for other users.
- Attack vectors: The mint function of the smart contract.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker would need to be able to interact with the smart contract and trigger the vulnerable minting function. This does not usually require special access.

It is important to note that while the presence of the file names indicates the presence of the vulnerability type, the provided content does not include details about the actual vulnerable code.
