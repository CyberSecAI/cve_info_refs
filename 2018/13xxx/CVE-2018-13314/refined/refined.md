{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The web application allows command injection via the `ipAddr` parameter in the `/boafrm/formAliasIP` endpoint.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Command injection vulnerability due to insufficient input validation.",
	  "Lack of server-side input sanitization."
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary system commands can be executed on the router's operating system, potentially leading to complete compromise of the device. The router can become permanently inoperable by injecting a `reboot now` command.",
    "attack_vectors": {
      "network": "Network access to the router's web interface is required.",
      "request": "An HTTP POST request to the `/boafrm/formAliasIP` endpoint with a crafted payload in the `ipAddr` parameter.",
        "payload": "The `ipAddr` parameter should include backticks (``) to inject system commands e.g., `192.168.1.112%60echo%20%22ise%22%20%3E%20%2Ftmp%2Fiseise%60`"
    },
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface. This typically means being on the same network as the router or having access through port forwarding."
