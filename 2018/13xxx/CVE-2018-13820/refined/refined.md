Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-13820:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a **hardcoded passphrase** within CA Unified Infrastructure Management (UIM).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The presence of a hardcoded passphrase creates a significant security risk. Anyone who discovers the passphrase can bypass authentication mechanisms that rely on it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Access to Sensitive Information:** An attacker who gains access to the hardcoded passphrase can use it to access sensitive information within the CA UIM system. This is not further specified but could potentially include system configuration, user data, and other sensitive details.
*   **Arbitrary CA UIM command execution:** The attacker can run arbitrary CA UIM commands on machines where the CA UIM probes are running.
*  **File system access:** An attacker can gain access to other machines running CA UIM and access the filesystems of those machines.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the CA UIM environment. This suggests that the vulnerability is exploitable on the local network where CA UIM is running.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have access to the network where CA UIM is deployed.
*   **Knowledge of the Hardcoded Passphrase:** The attacker must have knowledge of the hardcoded passphrase to exploit the vulnerability. This knowledge could be gained through reverse engineering, social engineering or by discovering the credentials via other vulnerabilities.

**Additional Details:**

*   This vulnerability is rated as having a **medium risk**.
*   It affects CA Unified Infrastructure Management versions 8.5.1, 8.5, and 8.4.7.
*   The vulnerability can be mitigated by applying "UIM Vulnerability Patch 1" and by implementing "UIM Best Practices for Secure Environments".
* The advisory states that a cumulative risk rating of High is reached when combining the impact of CVE-2018-13819, CVE-2018-13820, and CVE-2018-13821
