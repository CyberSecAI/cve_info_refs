| [Description](#c0)  Matt Beland    2002-02-12 00:04:09 UTC  ``` During the initial bootstrap, Gentoo downloads the packages for various applications (including glibc, gcc, binutils, gettext, etc.) using a "generic" make.conf rather than the customized make.conf created by the user. As was illustrated during the recent ibiblio outage, this means that the use of mirrors is impossible during initial installations. While a minor annoyance for single-system installations affected by rare outages, it could be a substantial problem for larger installations intending to run installations from a local mirror.  Suggested fix: Download the packages required for bootstrap.sh before switching the custom make.conf for the generic one. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Daniel Robbins (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-12 17:49:38 UTC  ``` This should now be fixed. ``` |  |

CVE ID         : CVE-2018-0618 CVE-2018-13796
Debian Bug     : 903674

Two flaws were discovered in mailman, a web-based mailing list manager.

CVE-2018-0618

    Toshitsugu Yoneyama of Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions, Inc.
    discovered that mailman is prone to a cross-site scripting flaw
    allowing a malicious listowner to inject scripts into the listinfo
    page, due to not validated input in the host_name field.

CVE-2018-13796

    Hammad Qureshi discovered a content spoofing vulnerability with
    invalid list name messages in the web UI.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1:2.1.18-2+deb8u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your mailman packages.

# Arbitrary text injection vulnerability in Mailman CGIs

Bug #1780874 reported by

on 2018-07-09

| Affects | | Status | Importance | Assigned to | Milestone |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | [GNU Mailman](https://bugs.launchpad.net/mailman) | Fix Released | Low | [Mark Sapiro](https://launchpad.net/~msapiro) | [GNU Mailman 2.1.28](https://launchpad.net/mailman/%2Bmilestone/2.1.28) |

### Bug Description

A URL with a very long text listname such as

<http://www.example.com/mailman/listinfo/This_is_a_long_string_with_some_phishing_text>

will echo the text in the "No such list" error response. This can be used to make a potential victim think the phishing text comes from a trusted site.

This issue was discovered by Hammad Qureshi <email address hidden>.
