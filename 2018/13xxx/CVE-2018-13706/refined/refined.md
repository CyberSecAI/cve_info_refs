The provided content does not directly contain information about CVE-2018-13706. However, it references a file named `mint integer overflow.md` located within the `IdeaCoin` and `GEMCHAIN` folders of the `EtherTokens` repository. This suggests the repository might contain information related to integer overflow vulnerabilities, which could be relevant to CVE-2018-13706 if the vulnerability is related to integer overflows in smart contracts.

Since no specific details about the vulnerability are available and the actual vulnerability details are located in a separate markdown file within the same repo, which is not provided here, I will respond with NOINFO.
