Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-13391:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability resides within the `ProfileLinkUserFormat` component of Jira Server. This component incorrectly handles user email visibility settings when displaying issue details.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is that the system discloses email addresses of the issue reporter and assignee, even when the user's email visibility setting is configured to hide it.
- **Authorization Bypass:** The vulnerability allows unauthorized access to user information that should have been protected by the configured privacy settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privacy Breach:** Attackers can obtain email addresses of users who might not want this information to be publicly visible.
- **Potential for further attacks:**  Exposed email addresses could be used in phishing attacks or other social engineering attempts.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote Access:** Attackers need to have remote access to the Jira instance and be able to view issue details. This suggests that the attacker must be authenticated and have the required permission to view issues.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with permission to view issues within the affected Jira instance.
- No special privileges appear to be required other than the ability to view issues in the vulnerable Jira versions.
