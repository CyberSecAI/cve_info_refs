The provided content is related to CVE-2018-13066.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a memory leak in the `libming` library, specifically in the `parser.c` file, as identified by the LeakSanitizer. Multiple memory leaks occur during the parsing of SWF files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is due to improper memory management within the `libming` library. The code allocates memory for various data structures during SWF file parsing but fails to free it after use, resulting in memory leaks. The leaks happen in multiple functions of the `parser.c` file and related parsing functions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploitation of the memory leaks could lead to the program consuming excessive memory, potentially resulting in denial of service or program instability.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a specially crafted SWF file that triggers the memory leaks during parsing by `libming`. The attacker provides a malicious SWF file to be processed by the vulnerable software.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted SWF file to a system that uses the vulnerable version of `libming` for SWF parsing. This could be achieved through various means depending on how the software is used, such as uploading a file, opening a file through a vulnerable application, or providing a link to the file. The attacker does not need any special privileges on the system to exploit the vulnerability.
