- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation by the `gridExcelExport` functionality.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can craft a malicious URL or inject malicious code into an input field that is processed by the vulnerable `gridExcelExport` functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send the crafted request to a victim user. The user must interact with the malicious URL or input, which is then processed by the vulnerable functionality.
