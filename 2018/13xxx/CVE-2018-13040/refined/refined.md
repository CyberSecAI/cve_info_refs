```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application lacks CSRF protection on the user creation feature. Specifically, when adding a new user, the application does not include a unique token to distinguish between different users' requests.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. The absence of a CSRF token makes it possible to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can add an administrative user to the system. This new admin user can then be used to take over the entire system.
- Attack vectors: The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that, when submitted, will send a request to the vulnerable application's user creation endpoint. The victim, an authenticated user, is tricked into loading this page which executes the malicious form submission in the background.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into accessing the malicious HTML page. The attacker does not need prior access to the target system.
