```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The JSONRPC API automatically creates routes to callable functions within the root scope of all modules, as long as these functions are not prefixed by an underscore. This allows the API to load and route new endpoints from modules. Some modules import dangerous functions directly using 'from settings import *' and 'from confutil import *', thus exposing sensitive functions.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Exposed internal functions via JSONRPC API",
    "Importing sensitive functions directly which makes them accessible via the API",
    "Lack of access control on imported functions"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries and create/overwrite shell scripts with arbitrary content in arbitrary locations, leading to potential complete system compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted JSONRPC request to the exposed functions such as `wbfs.executesql` or `wbfs.writeconf`.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An authenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability. However, due to an authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2018-13324), the vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker."
