Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2018-13251.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Integer overflow in the `readBytes` function within `/util/read.c`, leading to an attempted allocation of an extremely large memory chunk.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow vulnerability when reading data from a specially crafted SWF file
- Uncontrolled memory allocation due to the overflow

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) due to the program attempting to allocate a very large memory chunk, causing it to crash. This leads to program termination and potentially prevents it from completing its intended task

**Attack vectors:**
- By providing a malicious SWF file as input to `swftotcl`, an attacker can trigger the integer overflow and subsequent crash.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to craft a malicious SWF file with specific data to trigger the overflow
- Ability to provide the crafted SWF file as an input to the vulnerable `swftotcl` utility.
