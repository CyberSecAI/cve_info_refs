The provided content is related to CVE-2018-13442.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: SQL injection in the `TriggeringObjectEntityNames` parameter of a POST request to `/api/ActiveAlertsOnThisEntity/GetActiveAlerts` in SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor (NPM).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability that allows arbitrary SQL queries to be injected into the application's database.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Access to all data within the database, including login credentials for SolarWinds NPM.
    - Possibility of privilege escalation if administrator password hashes are cracked.
    - Potential access to the underlying file system or command execution, depending on database configuration and privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted POST request to `/api/ActiveAlertsOnThisEntity/GetActiveAlerts` with a malicious SQL query in the `TriggeringObjectEntityNames` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to have a compromised user account to authenticate to SolarWinds NPM.
    - User registration is approved by administrators, which would first need to be bypassed/compromised.
