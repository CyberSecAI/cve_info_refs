Root cause of vulnerability: Integer overflow in the mintToken function.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- The `mintToken` function in the Coffeecoin smart contract adds the `mintedAmount` to the `balanceOf[target]` without checking for overflows.
- Both `balanceOf[target]` and `mintedAmount` are defined as `uint256`, which are susceptible to integer overflows.
- Lack of proper overflow checks during the minting process.

Impact of exploitation:
- The contract owner can arbitrarily mint tokens to any user.
- An integer overflow occurs when a large amount of tokens are minted, causing the balance to wrap around to 0.
- The owner can manipulate any user's balance to any arbitrary value by triggering an overflow.

Attack vectors:
- The owner of the smart contract can call the `mintToken` function.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be the owner of the smart contract.
