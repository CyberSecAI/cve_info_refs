Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-13356:

**CVE-2018-13356: Missing Authorization on User Edit**

*   **Root Cause:** The TerraMaster TOS web application lacks proper authorization checks when editing user accounts.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Missing Authorization:** Non-administrator users can make requests to modify account information for any user on the NAS, including administrator accounts.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can elevate their privileges to administrator level.
    *   **Full Device Compromise:** By modifying administrator accounts, attackers can gain complete control over the device.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web interface of the TerraMaster TOS.
    *   **Web Request Forgery:** The attacker can craft a malicious POST request.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have a valid (but not necessarily administrator) account on the TerraMaster device.
    *   The attacker must know the target's username to modify.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP POST requests to the device's web interface.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to `/include/ajax/ajaxdata.php` with the `handleprocess=modifyuser` parameter. The attacker can then manipulate parameters such as `newname`, `email`, `phone`, and `grouplist` to change account details of any user, even if not an administrator.
