Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-13980:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content from `exploit-db.com` directly references CVE-2018-13980 and provides details about the vulnerability, thus it is relevant. The content from `www.zeta-producer.com` provides background information about the vulnerable software.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of CVE-2018-13980 lies in the "filebrowser" widget of Zeta Producer Desktop CMS. Specifically, it stems from **path traversal issues**.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The `file` parameter in the `filebrowser.main.php` script does not properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to use `../` sequences to access files and directories outside the intended web root.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local File Disclosure:** An unauthenticated attacker can read arbitrary files on the server with the privileges of the web server user. This includes sensitive configuration files, system files, and any other files accessible to the webserver process.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attack is performed by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the `filebrowser.main.php` script, exploiting the vulnerable `file` parameter.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running the vulnerable Zeta Producer instance.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication. The attacker does not need a user account or any prior access.
*   **Knowledge of the Software:** The attacker needs to know that Zeta Producer Desktop CMS is being used and that the vulnerable filebrowser widget is enabled.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `/assets/php/filebrowser/filebrowser.main.php` file.
*   The `file` parameter in this script is vulnerable to path traversal.
*   The attacker can use `../` sequences to move up the directory structure and access files located outside the intended web directory.
*   The `do` parameter can be used to either view a file as text or download it
*   Example exploits provided:
    * `http://target/assets/php/filebrowser/filebrowser.main.php?file=../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd&do=download`
    * `http://target/assets/php/filebrowser/filebrowser.main.php?file=../../../../../../../../../../etc&do=list`

**Additional Notes:**

* The `exploit-db.com` content also mentions a related Remote Code Execution vulnerability (CVE-2018-13981) related to the `formmailer` widget but the analysis focuses only on CVE-2018-13980.
* The vulnerability was patched in version 14.2.1 of Zeta Producer Desktop CMS.
* The vendor was contacted but did not initially reply.

**Summary:**

CVE-2018-13980 is a local file disclosure vulnerability in Zeta Producer Desktop CMS that allows an unauthenticated attacker to read arbitrary files from the server by exploiting a path traversal issue in the filebrowser widget.
