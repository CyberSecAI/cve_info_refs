    "description": "An issue was discovered in fs/f2fs/inode.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.3. A denial of service (slab out-of-bounds read and BUG) can occur for a modified f2fs filesystem image in which FI_EXTRA_ATTR is set in an inode.",

    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper validation when parsing the inode page. When the FI_EXTRA_ATTR bit is set in an inode, the kernel attempts to parse additional data, which can lead to an out-of-bounds read if the inode data is crafted maliciously.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Out-of-bounds read"
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of Service (system crash). A specifically crafted f2fs filesystem image can trigger a kernel crash when mounted.",
      "attack_vector": "Local. The attacker needs to mount a specially crafted f2fs image.",
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker must have the ability to mount a filesystem and provide a malicious f2fs filesystem image."
    },
     "suse_notes": "SUSE does not consider their products to be affected by this CVE. This is due to the conditions being hard to trigger and it can only be triggered with a crafted filesystem image that is specifically designed to trigger this bug. SUSE Bugzilla entry: 1100060. Fixed in openSUSE Leap 15.0 and various SUSE products"
