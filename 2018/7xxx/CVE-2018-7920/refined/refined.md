The provided content is related to CVE-2018-7920.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper implementation of the Access Control List (ACL) mechanism in certain Huawei AR series products.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper resource management
- Inadequate ACL implementation

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to the exhaustion of socket resources on the device's management interface, resulting in a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition. This means the device will become unresponsive to management requests.

**Attack vectors:**
A remote attacker sends specifically crafted TCP messages to the management interface of the vulnerable device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have network access to the affected device's network to send TCP messages to its management interface.
