The provided content is a security advisory from Huawei regarding two vulnerabilities in their eSpace product, one of which is CVE-2018-7959.

**CVE-2018-7959 Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** A short key vulnerability exists in the Huawei eSpace product when SRTP is enabled by the user to make a call.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The use of a short key makes the encryption susceptible to brute-force attacks, allowing the attacker to decrypt the call information.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation leads to sensitive information leakage, specifically the content of the encrypted calls.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker performs a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack to intercept the call information.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be positioned to perform a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept network traffic. The attacker does not need to be authenticated. The victim needs to have SRTP enabled when making the call.
