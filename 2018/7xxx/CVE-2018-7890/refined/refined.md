{
  "cve_id": "CVE-2018-7890",
  "description": "A remote code execution issue was discovered in Applications Manager before build 13640. The publicly accessible testCredential.do endpoint takes multiple user inputs and validates supplied credentials by accessing a specified system. This endpoint calls several internal classes, and then executes a PowerShell script. If the specified system is OfficeSharePointServer, then the username and password parameters to this script are not validated, leading to Command Injection.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application executes a powershell script with user-controlled parameters without proper sanitization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Command Injection",
       "Inadequate Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Unauthenticated remote code execution, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the user running the application.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited through a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `testCredential.do` endpoint.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not require authentication to exploit the vulnerability. They only need to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint."

  "affected_products": [
