- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Writing beyond the end of a coil or register through manipulation of the offset field in a `WRITE_SYSTEM_COILS_AND_HOLDING_REGISTERS` command. Specifically, requesting object type `0x21` with an offset value of `0xffffff`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Uncaught exception (CWE-248) due to an out-of-bounds write, leading to a non-recoverable fault state.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Device enters a non-recoverable fault state, stopping all remote communications and process logic execution. The device requires a physical power cycle to regain functionality.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted `WRITE_SYSTEM_COILS_AND_HOLDING_REGISTERS` command over the UMAS management protocol.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker can send unauthenticated commands to trigger this vulnerability over the network. No prior authentication is needed.
