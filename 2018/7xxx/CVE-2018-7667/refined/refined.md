Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7667:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Adminer, a web-based database management tool. Adminer allows unauthenticated users to initiate connections to arbitrary systems and ports.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated SSRF:** The primary vulnerability is that Adminer does not properly validate user-supplied input for the "server" parameter, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary hostnames and ports. This lack of authentication allows anyone to use the Adminer instance to make outbound connections.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation:** The application fails to sanitize or validate the server parameter which leads to the SSRF vulnerability.
*  **Bypassing Firewall/ACL Restrictions:** The SSRF vulnerability enables attackers to bypass firewalls and ACLs (Access Control Lists), as the requests originate from the Adminer server itself, which may be trusted by the firewall.
*   **Port Scanning:** The vulnerability can be exploited to perform port scanning on internal networks, identifying open services and potential attack vectors. Adminer's error responses were used to discern open/closed ports.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Reconnaissance:** Attackers can perform reconnaissance activities on internal networks, identifying internal hosts and open ports.
*   **Bypassing Security Controls:** Attackers can bypass external firewalls and ACLs designed to protect internal resources.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  While not directly mentioned, by exploiting the SSRF, an attacker could potentially interact with services on internal network and collect internal network information.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** The port scanning can be used as a first step for further targeted attacks against discovered services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Requests:** The attack vector involves crafting malicious HTTP GET requests to the Adminer instance, using the "server" parameter to specify a target host and port.
*  **Direct connection to Adminer instance:** The attacker needs to be able to directly connect to the Adminer instance and send malicious GET request.
    Example request: `GET ///?server=TARGET-IP:21&username= HTTP/1.1`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Adminer instance.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not require authentication to exploit the SSRF vulnerability.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to formulate an HTTP GET request.
