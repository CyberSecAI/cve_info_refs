Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-7707:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content explicitly mentions CVE-2018-7707 as one of the multiple vulnerabilities found in SecurEnvoy SecurMail 9.1.501.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of CVE-2018-7707 is the lack of proper encoding of user-supplied input when creating HTML pages, specifically within the HTML formatted emails. The application fails to sanitize or encode `<script>` tags, which are then executed when a victim opens the email within the web interface.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a persistent XSS vulnerability. The application allows the inclusion of arbitrary `<script>` tags within HTML formatted emails. These tags are stored and then executed when a recipient views the email in the web interface. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when the victim opens a maliciously crafted email. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing the victim's session cookies to impersonate them.
    *   **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive information within the victim's account.
    *   **Malware Injection:** Redirecting the victim to malicious websites or injecting malware into the user's system.
    *   **Defacement:** Modifying the content of the web interface viewed by the victim.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Email Injection:** The attacker crafts a malicious email containing HTML formatted content with embedded `<script>` tags.
*   **Victim Interaction:** The victim opens the malicious email in the SecurEnvoy web interface.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Send Email:** The attacker needs the ability to send emails to users of the vulnerable SecurEnvoy SecurMail instance. No specific authentication to the SecurEnvoy server is required for sending emails.
*   **No Server-Side Access Required:** The attacker doesn't need direct access to the server; they only need to be able to send emails that will be viewed through the web interface.
*   **Social Engineering:** To successfully exploit this, the attacker would likely use social engineering techniques to entice the victim to open the malicious email.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability is part of a cluster of vulnerabilities identified by SEC Consult.
*   The advisory mentions that the vulnerable application does not encode any user input and is therefore vulnerable to reflected and stored XSS vulnerabilities
*   The provided PoC shows a reflected XSS, while this CVE specifically addresses the stored XSS via HTML emails.
*   The fix is to apply the hotfix "1_012018" or update to version 9.2.501
