# Caldera Forms 1.6.0

![An image of a beautiful Caldera full of crystal blue water](https://calderaforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Custom-Forms-Caldera.jpg)

---

Caldera Forms 1.6 includes new features, bug fixes and fixes for minor security issues. Please note: Caldera Forms 1.6 begins a process of dropping support for PHP versions that no longer have security support. Details below.

## New Features

* Support for Caldera Forms Pro Enhanced Anti-spam
* Support for multiple checkboxes to be selected by default, using a filter.
* Caldera Forms Pro advanced anti-spam.
* Freemius insights integration.
* PHP Warnings

## Bugs Fixed

* Updated Parsely validation library to 2.8.1
* Improved: Made reply-to/from labels in main mailer more accurately reflect how Caldera Forms Pro works, when Caldera Forms Pro is being used.
* Fixed: Work around that was previously in place for WooCommerce nonce validation when items are in cart is now updated to work again.
* Fixed: Breadcrumbs on multi-page forms disappeared when form was submitted, but did not complete the submission.
* Fixed: Multi-page forms not advancing with empty, non-required number fields.
* Fixed: Field sync was not recovering when fields were hidden by conditional logic.
* Fixed: CC and BCC fields not passing to Caldera Forms Pro properly.
* Fixed: Some cases where file fields caused errors during submissions.
* Fixed: Wrong country code was used for Arkansas. Sorry Arkansas.

## Supported PHP Versions

Caldera Forms 1.6 deprecates support for PHP 5.5 and below. Caldera Forms 1.7 will not work with out of date versions of PHP.

## Security Disclosure

### Details

This update includes fixes for three minor security issues that create stored XSS vulnerabilities, they were discovered by [Federico Scalco](http://mentat.is/). We would like to thank Fedrico for finding these bugs and responsibly disclosing them. We will link to the relevant CVE, with full details when it is made public.

We have no evidence that any of these issues have been exploited.

Please note that we have created automated tests to ensure that the fix will prevent these vulnerabilities from being exploited, that future versions do not become vulnerable to the same issue again and that the fixes do not create unintended side effects. These tests will be a part of

### What You Should Do

Short version: Update to Caldera Forms 1.6.

Here is more specific advice, to ensure your site, even if you can not update to the latest version right away:

* If you are using magic tags in the success message shown after a form submits. Make sure to update to Caldera Forms 1.6 right away. If not possible, remove the magic tags from the success message.
* If you have left the debug mailer option on, turn it off. This is a good idea in general as the debug mailer gets saved with the entry and that’s a lot of extra data. This issue is fixed in version 1.6.0.
* There is now a “Trusted” option on the import form pop-up. You should only check this box if you created the export file. If not, do not check it and potentially unsafe data will be removed. Until you update, only use import files you created yourself.

I’m so disappointed that this plugin is going to be retired soon. It was such a great alternative to Contact Form 7 which is a PITA when it comes to formatting.
Anyway…I’ve really enjoyed using Caldera Forms and I will truly miss it. Yet another reason why I’ve been developing exclusively with the Avada theme (they have their own built-in forms, very similar to Caldera).

Used to be really good, not anymore. This plugin hasn’t been updated in a long time, no devs are responding on the support forum. You may want to look at alternatives.

It will not be continued into 2022. It’s sad they sold to NinjaForms, which I dislike for so many reasons. Wished they had looked for people who cared for it and wanted to keep it alive. But no, you must kill it for not reason. It’s really disappointing for all the endless hours I invested in it.

Caldera used to be the best but now we had to move many sites away from it because of all the errors (jquery, php, javascript). Caldera Forms doesn’t work anymore on any of my sites

Want to change the message appearing on notify emails. Doesn’t take my changes. Email sending works but always with the predefined summary. After hours of Google search to solve the problem I will give it up and move forward to another form plugin.

# Exploit Title: CalderaForms 1.5.9.1 - multiple XSS
# Date: 02-03-2018
# Exploit Author: Federico Scalco
#    fscalco at mentat dot is
#    @mindpr00f
# Vendor Homepage: https://calderaforms.com/
# Software Link: https://wordpress.org/plugins/caldera-forms/
# Vulnerable App: https://github.com/CalderaWP/Caldera-Forms/archive/1.5.9.1.zip
# Version: 1.5.9.1 (older versions may also be affected)
# Tested on: WordPress 4.9.4
# CVE : ﻿CVE-2018-7747

1) SOFTWARE DESCRIPTION
"﻿Caldera Form is a free and powerful WordPress plugin that creates
responsive forms with a simple drag and drop editor."
It is reported to have ﻿100,000+ active installations at the moment of this
writing.

2) VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW
The application fails to validate user-supplied input, hence it stores the
unsanitized buffer in the database.
The vulnerabilities reported here will be exploitable ONLY if certain
conditions are met, which is not the case in a CF's default configuration
(although still being vulnerable).

A note on buffers containing strings:
    single (') and double (") quotes are correctly escaped, backticks (`)
are not.

3) DETAILS

3.a) Stored XSS - public
When submitting a CF form, the plugin will show a greeting message to
notify the user that everything went ok.
This message is editable by the site's admin and can contain part of the
user-supplied data (e.g. they're first name). In this case, simply inject
HTML code into the parameter which gets returned in the greeting message
and submit the POST request. A JSON response will follow, containing, among
other data:
- the greeting message ("html", which contains the malicious payload that
gets executed right away)
- form's ID ("form_id")
- data's ID ("cf_id")

{
    "data":{"cf_id":"<DATA_ID>"},
    "html":"<GREETING MESSAGE>",
    "type":"...",
    "form_id":"<FORM_ID>",
    "form_name":"...",
    "status":"..."
}

At this point, to reach the stored XSS, simply build a GET request using
the obtained data.
The malicious payload will be found at

    http(s)://<target>/cf-api/<FORM_ID>/?cf_su=1&cf_id=<DATA_ID>

Vulnerable config:
    - form > form settings > capture entries > checked (ON by default)
    - form > form settings > success message > add some of the user
supplied fields (absent by default)

To replicate this on a fresh install:
    - Create a new, default, contact form
    - Go to "Form Settings" tab and edit the success message to include,
for example, the user's first name.
e.g.: Form has been successfully submitted. Thank you %first_name%.
    - Save & publish
    - As an unauthenticated user, submit the contact form injecting HTML
code in first name's parameter. XSS will be triggered right away
    - To recall the payload as a stored XSS, read the POST's response and
point your browser to
        <target>/cf-api/<FORM_ID>/?cf_su=1&cf_id=<DATA_ID>

3.b) Stored XSS - admin interface
CalderaForms gives the ability to notify the admin via email everytime a
form gets submitted.
Furthermore, an admin can choose to enable an "email transacion log" for
debugging purposes (disabled by default).
If this configuration is in place, a copy of the malicious payload
described above will be shown in the administration panel, when visiting
that form's malicious entry's details.

Vulnerable config:
    - form > form settings > capture entries > checked (ON by default)
    - form > email > debug mailer > checked (OFF by default)

To replicate this on a fresh install:
    - Enable the transaction log (form -> edit -> email tab -> check
"Enable email send transaction log")
    - Replicate the injection described at 3.a (all fields can be used this
time) as an unauthenticated user
    - Back again in the admin interface, visit form's entries, identify the
malicious one and click on the "view" button

    This will pop a details window and trigger the XSS.

3.c) Importing a weaponized form - admin interface
CalderaForms gives the ability to import a form (JSON format).
A malicious form field can be crafted which will trigger an XSS when said
field gets displayed/edited after the import.

It's worth noting that this flaw does not depend on custom configurations,
although it's not "remotely" and "automatically" exploitable. The problem
here arise, for example, when an admin imports a malicious JSON.

To replicate this on a fresh install:
    - Create a form and export it (JSON format)
    - Edit the json and inject HTML code. "label" and "slug" parameters
were tested, others may be vulnerable too.
    e.g.:
    {
        ...
            "label":"First<script>alert(1);</script> Name",
            "slug":"first_name\"/><script>alert(2);</script>"
        ...
    }

    - Import the malicious form to trigger the XSS in the administration
interface

4) REMEDIATION
Update to the latest version available.

If any personalized configuration is found exploitable, the following steps
can be followed, as a temporary mitigation strategy, if no update is
available or updating is not an option, for whatever reason:
    - for every form, under "Form Settings", prune every variable that gets
returned to the user as a success message
    - for every form, under the "Email" tab, un-check "Enable email send
transaction log"
    - for every form that gets imported perform a thorough review

5) TIMELINE & FINAL NOTES

    06-03-18 > vendor replies
    07-03-18 > CVE requested and assigned
    27-03-18 > patch released

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

### By [Josh Pollock](https://joshpress.net)

Josh Pollock was the founder of CalderaWP and the lead developer of Caldera Forms. He is also a WordPress core contributor and the author of two books about WordPress development.

Posted On: March 27, 2018

---

Today we are happy to announce the release of Caldera Forms 1.6. This release brings several features that have been requested by our users, and sets us up to bring more in demand features to Caldera Forms in future releases.

Caldera Forms 1.6 introduces Caldera Forms Pro enhanced anti-spam,

**Important**: This update includes fixes for **minor security issues**. While these are relatively minor issues, which we have no evidence have ever been exploited, we do recommend updating immediately. If you can not update immediately please read the security release notes to find out if you should be concerned and, if so, what to do.

## What’s Changed In Caldera Forms 1.6

### Improved Anti-Spam

[![Caldera Forms settings for advanced anti-spam](https://calderaforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-12-at-1.26.27-PM-300x220.png)](https://calderaforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-12-at-1.26.27-PM.png)One of the reasons we launched Caldera Forms Pro is we didn’t want to educate users about transactional email systems, DNS records, and all the other complicated parts of ensuring form emails are sent. Instead, we took what we had learned and put it in one easy to use package. When our strategy needs to change — for example when we expanded the number of IP addresses we use earlier this month — everyone using Caldera Forms Pro benefits from the improvement, without having to do anything or update their site.

When we surveyed our users earlier this year, we asked what we could do better and we got two very clear responses: better documentation and better anti-spam. We redesigned our documentation search earlier this year and are currently rewriting our most visited documentation and recording all new videos.

But, we’re also worried about increased reports about spam. We decided to take the same approach we took to email delivery with anti-spam. Like with email deliverability, best practices to avoid spam are constantly changing. What worked last year doesn’t always work today, and what works today, might not work next year.

Caldera Forms Pro anti-spam is very simple to set up. Just check the “Advanced” option in the new Anti-Spam tab. Then tell Caldera Forms which field has the form message and which has the sender’s name. Caldera Forms Pro takes care of the rest.

> [Advanced Anti-Spam Protection With Caldera Forms Pro](https://calderaforms.com/doc/advanced-anti-spam-protection-caldera-forms-pro/)

### More Flexible Auto-Responders

Another request we’ve gotten is for support for adding a BCC to auto-responders. We’ve also heard from several users that they would like to have multiple CCs and BCCs on auto-responders.

Both are possible with Caldera Forms 1.6. This also allows for multiple conditional recipients.

### Multiple Defaults For Checkboxes

In our Facebook group, we recently had a question about using the [caldera\_forms\_render\_get\_field filter](https://calderaforms.com/2018/03/caldera-forms-1-6-is-here/) to set multiple defaults for a checkbox field. That was not possible with the current version of Caldera Forms. A Caldera Forms user, [Diego de Oliveira](https://github.com/diegoliv), volunteered to make this possible and submitted a pull request that is now a part of Caldera Forms 1.6.

There is [an example of how to use this new feature in the documentation for that filter](https://calderaforms.com/doc/caldera_forms_render_get_field/#checkbock-multi). We are [continuing to collaborate with Diego](https://github.com/CalderaWP/Caldera-Forms/issues/2327) on an improved interface for configuring field options, which will provide a UI for this feature in a future release.

[We are always happy to accept a pull request from the community](https://github.com/CalderaWP/Caldera-Forms/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Security Fixes

Caldera Forms 1.6.0 includes fixes for three minor security issues that create stored XSS vulnerabilities, they were discovered by [Federico Scalco](http://mentat.is). We would like to thank Fedrico for finding these bugs and responsibly disclosing them. His work is making our plugin better and our users safer.

All three issues are “stored XSS vulnerabilities” which, in less technical terms, means that Fedrico found three ways to use Caldera Forms to store JavaScript that would be run later, possibly for malicious reasons. For more details on how to know if your site, that can not yet update to Caldera Forms 1.6, may be vulnerable and what to do to protect your site, besides updating, see the [release notes](https://calderaforms.com/updates/caldera-forms-1-6-0#security).

In order to ensure that this fix does prevent these potential XSS vulnerabilities, and also that we do not re-introduce the vulnerability, we have created new automated tests. These tests, which are in a private git repository, will be run on future releases and we will add additional security checks in the future.

### Other Bug Fixes

For a full list of bug fixes, please [see the release notes](https://calderaforms.com/?post_type=cwp_updates&p=106811#bugs). This update includes important fixes for mutli-page forms and file uploads.

## Platform Changes

### Legacy PHP Version Support Deprecated

As we announced last week Caldera Forms 1.6, will work with any version of PHP, but will alert you if your version of PHP is not supported by the PHP project anymore. If your site is running on PHP 5.6 or later, the oldest version of PHP that gets security updates from the PHP project, then nothing will change.

If you are using PHP 5.5 or an older, a warning will replace the buttons in the main admin page for Caldera Forms. Your forms will still work fine.

### Freemius

In Caldera Forms 1.6, we have integrated [Freemius Insights.](https://freemius.com/wordpress/insights/) All users will be asked once if they would like to voluntarily opt in to basic usage tracking. This is entirely optional. If you do not want to participate, simply decline. [By opting in, you will share your email, and some basic information about the WordPress configuration](https://freemius.com/wordpress/usage-tracking/).

Our immediate goal is to better understand our users a little bit better to help focus our support and testing efforts. For example, we currently run our automated tests without any other plugins active. We would like to start running those tests with the plugins most likely to be active on a site with Caldera Forms. This would help us catch conflicts with other plugins or themes, before we finish developing an update. We currently don’t know what those plugins are, this will help us find out.

For complete details about what is tracked by Freemius, [click here](https://freemius.com/wordpress/usage-tracking/).

## What’s Next?

That’s what’s new in Caldera Forms 1.6, which is available today. We’d like to provide a brief update on what’s next.

Our next priority, which will be the focus of Caldera Forms 1.7 will be tools to ensure sites powered by Caldera Forms are able to follow new EU data privacy laws to be GPDR compliant. We will provide tools for you to respond to requests for all form data submitted by a specific user, and to delete that data. These tools will require activation by the site admin. In addition, we will add support for automatically deleting entries older than a certain date.

Caldera Forms 1.7 will be released in May. In order to create those features, we will have to make it easier to query entries by a field’s value — for example the email address field. That is a feature that has been requested many times by users who are looking to develop applications that use Caldera Forms entry data. In addition, it will help us improve the entry viewer.
