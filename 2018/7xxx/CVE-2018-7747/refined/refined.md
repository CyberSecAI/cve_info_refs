Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-7747:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the Caldera Forms plugin, leading to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Specifically, the plugin fails to validate user-supplied data, allowing attackers to inject malicious code that is then stored in the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored XSS:** The primary vulnerability is stored XSS, where injected JavaScript code is saved and executed later when the data is displayed.
    *   **Public Stored XSS:**  Malicious code injected into form fields is reflected in the success message shown to users after form submission and when accessing the entry via a specific URL.
    *   **Admin Interface Stored XSS:** Malicious code is stored in the email transaction log, and is executed when the admin views details of a malicious entry.
    *   **Imported Form XSS:** Malicious code embedded within imported form configurations (JSON format) is executed when the form is displayed or edited.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser. This can lead to:
    *   **Account Takeover:** If an admin is targeted, their account could be compromised.
    *   **Data Theft:** Sensitive information could be stolen.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Users of the website could be redirected to malicious websites.
    *   **Website Defacement:** The appearance or content of the website could be altered.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Form Submissions:** Injecting malicious code into form fields when submitting forms.
*   **Direct GET Requests:** Crafting requests to the vulnerable API endpoint that returns form entry data.
*   **Imported Forms:** Importing a specifically crafted, malicious form via JSON.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Public XSS:** An unauthenticated user can trigger the vulnerability by submitting a form with malicious data.
*   **Admin XSS:** An attacker would need to submit a form with malicious data, and the admin would have to enable the "email transaction log". An admin user would have to view the entry for the XSS to trigger.
*    **Imported Form XSS:** An attacker would need to convince an admin user to import a malicious JSON form.

**Additional details:**
* The vulnerability was discovered by Federico Scalco.
* The vulnerable plugin version is 1.5.9.1, and possibly older versions.
* The vendor was notified on 02-03-2018 and the patch was released on 27-03-2018.
