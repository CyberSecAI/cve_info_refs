Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-7440:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an incomplete fix for a previous command injection vulnerability (CVE-2018-3836) in the `gplotMakeOutput` function of the Leptonica library. Specifically, the `gplot rootname` argument was not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Command Injection: The `gplotMakeOutput` function allows command injection via the `$(command)` approach within the `gplot rootname` argument. This means an attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system running the vulnerable application. This can lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, malware installation, and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious Input: The primary attack vector is through providing a specially crafted `gplot rootname` argument containing shell commands to the vulnerable function. This input is typically user-controlled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide or control the input string that's used as the `gplot rootname` argument to the `gplotMakeOutput` function. This typically involves manipulating data passed to an application using the Leptonica library.
