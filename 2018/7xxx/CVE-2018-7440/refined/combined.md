Package        : leptonlib
Version        : 1.69-3.1+deb7u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-7186 CVE-2018-7440
Debian Bug     : 890548 891932

Different flaws have been found in leptonlib, an image processing
library.

CVE-2018-7186

    Leptonica did not limit the number of characters in a %s format
    argument to fscanf or sscanf, that made it possible to remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer overflow)
    or possibly have unspecified other impact via a long string.

CVE-2018-7440

    The gplotMakeOutput function allowed command injection via a
    $(command) approach in the gplot rootname argument. This issue
    existed because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2018-3836.

For Debian 7 "Wheezy", these problems have been fixed in version
1.69-3.1+deb7u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your leptonlib packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# gplotMakeOutput Command Injection VulnerabilityÂ #303

[New issue](/login?return_to=)[Jump to bottom](#comment-composer-heading)Copy link[New issue](/login?return_to=)[Jump to bottom](#comment-composer-heading)Copy linkOpenOpen[gplotMakeOutput Command Injection Vulnerability](#top)#303Copy link[![@ghost](https://github.com/ghost.png?size=80)](/ghost)
## Description

[![@ghost](https://github.com/ghost.png?size=48)](/ghost)[ghost](/ghost)opened [on Feb 6, 2018](https://github.com/DanBloomberg/leptonica/issues/303#issue-294666232)

An exploitable command injection vulnerability exists in the gplotMakeOutputfunction of Leptonica 1.74.4. A specially crafted gplot rootname argument can cause a command injection resulting in arbitrary code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious path as input to an application that passes attacker data to this function to trigger this vulnerability.

For details refer to [this](https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2018-0516) write-up. This has been assigned [CVE-2018-3836](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jv24-gr2j-qp4r "CVE-2018-3836").
