Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-7260:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue found in the central columns feature of phpMyAdmin. Specifically, the `total_rows` parameter in `db_central_columns.php` was not properly sanitized, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `total_rows` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially steal session cookies by injecting malicious javascript.
- The attacker could potentially perform other actions within the user's phpMyAdmin session, such as modifying data, creating new users, or other administrative functions.
- This type of attack can be used for phishing, defacement, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes the malicious JavaScript payload within the `total_rows` parameter. 
- The vulnerable URL is of the form `https://localhost/phpmyadmin/db_central_columns.php?total_rows=0'"<script>alert(1)</script>`. The attacker could replace `alert(1)` with other malicious JavaScript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to entice a user to click a malicious link.
- The attacker does not necessarily need to have a user's credentials, as the attack is targeted at the phpMyAdmin session.
- The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in phpMyAdmin versions 4.7.x prior to 4.7.8 and also affects older versions since 4.3.0.
- The phpMyAdmin team considers the vulnerability to be of moderate severity.
- A CSRF token is required to exploit this vulnerability in version 4.7.7. However, version 4.7.4 is vulnerable without CSRF token.
- A patch has been released in phpMyAdmin version 4.7.8 that properly sanitizes the input and mitigates the XSS vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is also present in development environment at `https://demo.phpmyadmin.net/master-config/`.

The fix involves sanitizing user input for the `total_rows` parameter, which is handled by the `PMA_isValid` function, to prevent the execution of injected script.
