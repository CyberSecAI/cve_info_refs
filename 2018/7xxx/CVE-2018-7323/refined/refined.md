Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-7323:

**Root Cause:**

-   The root cause lies in multiple dissectors within Wireshark that can enter large or infinite loops due to malformed packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

-   **Infinite Loop Vulnerability:** The primary vulnerability is the potential for various dissectors to enter infinite loops when processing specific malformed network packets. This occurs due to improper handling of packet data, leading to repetitive processing and a lack of exit conditions in the dissector logic.
-   Affected dissectors include: All ASN.1 BER dissectors, along with DICOM, DMP, LLTD, OpenFlow, RELOAD, RPCoRDMA, RPKI-Router, S7COMM, SCCP, Thread, Thrift, USB, and WCCP.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to excessive CPU resource consumption, effectively causing a denial-of-service condition. This prevents Wireshark from functioning correctly or potentially crashing the application.
-   **Resource Exhaustion:** By injecting specially crafted or malformed packets, an attacker can force the vulnerable dissectors to enter infinite loops. This rapidly exhausts CPU resources and freezes the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Network Injection:** An attacker can inject malformed packets directly onto the network being monitored by Wireshark.
-   **Malformed Capture File:** An attacker could convince a user to open a malformed packet capture (pcap) file, which would trigger the vulnerability during the dissection process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs the ability to introduce malformed packets into a network that is being monitored by Wireshark, or be able to provide a user with a malicious pcap file. This doesn't require any special privileges, but it may require access to the network or a means to deliver a malicious file to the target.

**Additional Details:**

-   The vulnerability affects Wireshark versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.4 and 2.2.0 to 2.2.12.
-   Fixed versions are 2.4.5 and 2.2.13.
-   Multiple specific instances of this issue are identified, such as in the WCCP dissector.

This information provides a more detailed picture of the vulnerability than the basic CVE description, particularly concerning the large number of impacted dissectors and the specific manner in which the infinite loops are triggered.
