Based on the provided commit diff, the vulnerability lies in the way the multipart boundary is handled within the `aws-lambda-multipart-parser` library.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The code was using `.split(new RegExp(boundary))` to split the multipart body, which is vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attacks if the boundary string contains special regex characters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  ReDoS vulnerability: The use of a regular expression with user-controlled input (the boundary string) makes the parser vulnerable to denial of service attacks. A malicious user can craft a boundary string with special regex characters that makes the regex engine work very slowly.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service: By providing a specially crafted boundary string, an attacker can cause the server to become unresponsive due to excessive CPU consumption from the regex processing.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker would need to control the 'Content-Type' header in the multipart form data sent to the vulnerable AWS Lambda function. This is typically done through HTTP requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the AWS Lambda function that uses the vulnerable library.
- The attacker must have knowledge of how to craft the malicious boundary string to trigger the vulnerability.

**Changes in the commit:**
The commit fixes the vulnerability by changing the `.split(new RegExp(boundary))` to `.split(boundary)`. The fix is to use the string split function instead of using a regular expression, avoiding the ReDos vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The commit also updates the package.json file from version 0.1.1 to version 0.1.2, indicating a security update.
