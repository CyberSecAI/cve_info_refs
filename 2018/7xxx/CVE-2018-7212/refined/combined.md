# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Sinatra doesn't treat PATH\_INFO "" and "/" the same #13

## Description

[![@mraidel](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6256?v=4&size=48)](/mraidel)[mraidel](https://github.com/mraidel)opened [on May 23, 2010](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra/issues/13#issue-204074)

When working with the Rails 3 router, I recognized, that mounted apps are given a PATH\_INFO of "" (empty string) on the base-url. When using get "/" in Sinatra, the action doesn't match the request (I would have to use get "").As suggested by Joshua Peek (author of rack-mount) Sinatra should treat PATH\_INFO "" and "/" the same as PATH\_INFO is allowed to be an empty string. What do you think?

Due to the Windows environment, more check backslashes in `static!` method and enhanced the `path_traversal` validation in `rack-protection`

Oh, sorry I misunderstood your question :(

This line check the user-supplied `path` must under `public_dir`, or it will return `nil` to prevent user from path traversal attack.

I agree a code comment about when `path.start_with?(public_dir)` would evaluate to false would be helpful. I'm actually not sure I understand when that would happen 😬

I think this is not necessary actually because [`.` and `..` have been reduced by rack-protection](https://github.com/orangetw/sinatra/blob/d17aa95f5056c52daf5d7c3170fbfd831dc96381/rack-protection/lib/rack/protection/path_traversal.rb#L39-L42).

Even in the case of invalidating the `:path_traversal` setting on rack-protection, you should still add comment in the code if you think that it is meaningful to activate this restriction.

[@orangetw](https://github.com/orangetw) Could you add the comment in the code?

The major enhancement I already commit to `rack-protections` (added back-slash check to the `path_traversal.rb`), this line(in `base.rb`) is just double check and ensure that there is no unknown(unexpected) attack vector.

I am not a ruby developer, so if you think that line is unnecessary, maybe only merge the changes on `path_traversal.rb`?

As a personal opinion, I prefer a simple structure.

Double check increases software complexity.

And yes, the essence of the problem is certainly fixed with your commit to rack-protection.

If you agree with my opinion, please drop this line.

| [@peterkeen](https://github.com/peterkeen): I was just looking into the same thing myself. I believe it effects all versions of rack-protection before 2.0.1. I think it would be possible to backport the fix here and cut a 1.5.4 release from the separate rack-protection repo: <https://github.com/sinatra/rack-protection/blob/v1.5.3/lib/rack/protection/path_traversal.rb> |

Because in the previous version of the gemspec we had an open reference to Sinatra it meant we were essentially saying any version would do.

Hakiri was flagging this with [[CVE-2018-7212](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-h29f-7f56-j8wh "CVE-2018-7212")]([sinatra/sinatra#1379](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra/pull/1379)), the resolution of which was to specify a version equal to or greater than 2.0.1

It was then flagging this project with [[CVE-2018-11627](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mq35-wqvf-r23c "CVE-2018-11627")]([sinatra/sinatra#1428](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra/issues/1428)), and again the resolution was to specify a version, this time equal to or greater than 2.0.2
