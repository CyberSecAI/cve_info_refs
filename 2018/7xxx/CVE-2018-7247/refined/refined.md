Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7247:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a buffer overflow in the `pixHtmlViewer` function within the `prog/htmlviewer.c` file of the Leptonica library. The `rootname` variable, which is taken as input, was not properly sanitized or validated before being used in `sprintf` calls to create output file names. This allows an attacker to control the size of data being written to the `charbuf` buffer leading to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow (CWE-119):** The primary weakness is a classic buffer overflow. Specifically, the `sprintf` function was used without any size checks to copy the `rootname` into a fixed-size buffer `charbuf`, which can overflow if `rootname` is too long.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The most significant impact is the potential for arbitrary code execution. By overflowing the buffer, an attacker could overwrite adjacent memory locations, potentially leading to control flow hijacking.
- **Unspecified Other Impact:** The vulnerability could also lead to other unspecified impacts, such as denial of service or unexpected behavior, due to memory corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unsanitized Input:** The attack vector is the `rootname` parameter, which is taken as user input and not sanitized before processing.
- **Network:**  The CVSS score indicates a network attack vector, which implies that the input could be controllable via a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any special privileges.
- No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input for the `rootname` parameter.
- The attacker would need to find a use case or an application which uses the affected library in a vulnerable way and through which this parameter is controllable.

**Additional details:**
- The provided commit `c1079bb` in the Leptonica repository shows the fix for this vulnerability, which replaces the insecure `sprintf` with `snprintf`, ensuring a maximum number of bytes is copied and therefore preventing the overflow.
- The GitHub advisory database states the severity as critical with a CVSS score of 9.8.
- The EPSS score is 0.456%, which indicates a low probability of the vulnerability being exploited.
- The Gentoo security advisory indicates the affected package is `media-libs/leptonica` and that versions prior to 1.81.0 are vulnerable.

In summary, CVE-2018-7247 is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the Leptonica library that can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability was due to the use of `sprintf` with unsanitized input. The fix replaced `sprintf` with `snprintf`.
