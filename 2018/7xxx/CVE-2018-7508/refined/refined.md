{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by improper neutralization of input during web page generation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper input sanitization.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts in the context of the user's browser. This could lead to information disclosure (sensitive data theft) or other malicious activities performed on behalf of the user.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the web interface of the PI Web API. An attacker would need to inject malicious script into a vulnerable input field that is not correctly sanitized, which is then reflected back to the user's browser.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need any special privileges, but needs to be able to inject malicious content into the web interface. User interaction is required for the exploitation."
