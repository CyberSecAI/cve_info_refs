SUMMARY

The latest update for SCALANCE W1750D ﬁxes multiple vulnerabilities. The most severe could allow
an unauthenticated attacker with access to the web interface of an affected device to execute arbitrary
system commands within the underlying operating system.

Siemens has released updates for the affected devices.

view/109766816/

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict access to the web-based management interface to the internal or VPN network.

• Do not browse other websites and do not click on external links while being authenticated to the

administrative web interface.

• Apply appropriate strategies for mitigation.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download), and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.0
(CVSS v3.0) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-7084

A command injection vulnerability is present that permits an unauthenticated user with access to
the web interface of the affected device to execute arbitrary system commands within the underlying
operating system. An attacker could use this ability to copy ﬁles, read conﬁguration, write ﬁles, delete
ﬁles, or reboot the device.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to the affected system.
Successful exploitation requires no system privileges and no user interaction. An attacker could use
the vulnerability to compromise conﬁdentiality, integrity and availability of the affected system.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-7083

A vulnerability exists in the affected devices that allows an unauthenticated attacker to access core
dumps of previously crashed processes through the web interface of the device.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to the affected system.
Successful exploitation requires no system privileges and no user interaction. An attacker could use
the vulnerability to compromise conﬁdentiality of the affected system.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-16417

A vulnerability is present which allows an unauthenticated user to retrieve recently cached conﬁguration
commands by sending a crafted URL to the web interface of an affected device.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to the affected system.
Successful exploitation requires no system privileges and no user interaction. An attacker could use
the vulnerability to compromise conﬁdentiality of the affected system.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-7064

A reﬂected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the web interface of the affected devices
that allows an attacker to trick an administrator into clicking a link which could then take administrative
actions on the device or expose a session cookie for an administrative session.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to the affected system.
Successful exploitation requires no system privileges. An attacker could use the vulnerability to
compromise conﬁdentiality, integrity and availability of the affected system.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.
