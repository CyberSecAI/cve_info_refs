Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7889:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of Python's `cPickle` module for deserializing data in Calibre E-book Manager, specifically when importing bookmark files. The `pickle` module is known to be insecure when handling untrusted data because it allows arbitrary code execution during deserialization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The core weakness is the use of `cPickle.load()` to process bookmark files. A maliciously crafted pickle file can inject code to be executed when loaded by Calibre.
*   **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The application does not validate or sanitize the imported data before deserializing it with `cPickle.load()`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine with the privileges of the user running Calibre. This can allow the attacker to take control of the system, install malware, steal data, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Social Engineering:** An attacker could send a malicious bookmark file to a Calibre user (e.g. via email) and trick them into importing it.
*   **File Import:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user imports a specially crafted `.pickle` file through the "Import bookmarks" feature.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create Malicious Pickle Files:** The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious pickle file containing the desired payload (e.g., reverse shell).
*   **Social Engineering or Access to User Machine:** The attacker must convince the victim to import the malicious file or have direct access to the machine to perform this action.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content from the github commit log shows that the developer changed the import/export format of bookmarks to use JSON instead of pickle to address this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was initially found in the bookmark import functionality but a similar issue existed in library export data. The library export issue was addressed by adding a warning message upon import due to the fact that the library export contained executable code.
*   The exploit code provided uses `os.system` to execute a bash command and set up a reverse shell, highlighting the impact of the vulnerability.
