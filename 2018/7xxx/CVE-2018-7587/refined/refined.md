Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2018-7587:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is an allocation failure in `CImg.h` when loading crafted BMP images. Specifically, the issue occurs within the `_load_bmp` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Allocation Failure:** The vulnerability stems from the CImg library's inability to handle malformed or crafted BMP image files correctly, leading to allocation failures during the image loading process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a denial of service. When a crafted BMP image is processed, the allocation failure can lead to a crash of the application or service using the vulnerable library.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious BMP Image:** The attack vector involves providing a specially crafted BMP image to the vulnerable application or service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to supply a crafted BMP file to the application using the vulnerable CImg library. This could be achieved through various means, such as:
    *   Uploading a malicious file to a web service that uses the library for image processing.
    *   Sending a malicious file to an application that uses the library to handle images.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content shows that multiple vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-7587, CVE-2018-7588, and CVE-2018-7589) were addressed by a single patch.
*   The patch adds additional checks for malformed input in the `load_bmp()` function.
*   The vulnerability is specifically triggered during the loading of BMP image files.
*   The `github.com` content provides multiple proof-of-concept (PoC) files that cause different types of errors such as heap overflows, double-free, allocation failures etc. when loaded using CImg, one of which is likely related to this CVE.

In summary, CVE-2018-7587 describes an allocation failure vulnerability within the CImg library that is triggered when loading malformed BMP images. This results in a denial-of-service condition.
