{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol implementation in the Linux kernel lacks a null pointer check in the `__rds_rdma_map()` function when memory registration is attempted without an underlying transport being loaded.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Null pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to a system with the rds module loaded."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to load the rds module and call the setsockopt system call."
  },
  "additional_details": [
   {
        "detail": "The vulnerability is triggered when the `setsockopt()` system call is used with the `RDS_GET_MR` or `RDS_GET_MR_FOR_DEST` options, which leads to a call to `__rds_rdma_map()`. If `rs->rs_transport` is NULL, the code will try to access `rs->rs_transport->get_mr` causing a null pointer dereference."
    },
    {
      "detail": "The fix involves adding an additional check in `__rds_rdma_map()` to ensure that `rs->rs_transport` is not NULL before attempting to access `rs->rs_transport->get_mr`. If `rs->rs_transport` is NULL, the function exits with `-ENOTCONN`."
   },
   {
      "detail": "The vulnerability was found using the syzkaller tool."
