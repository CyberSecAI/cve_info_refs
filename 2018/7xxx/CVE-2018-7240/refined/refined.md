This document provides details about multiple vulnerabilities affecting Schneider Electric Modicon PLCs, including CVE-2018-7240.

**CVE-2018-7240 Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The FTP server in affected Modicon PLC devices does not properly limit the length of command parameters.
*   **Vulnerability:** Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121).
*   **Impact:**  A successful exploit could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
*  **Attack Vector:** Network based, exploiting the FTP server functionality.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Remote attacker with network access to the device, ability to send crafted FTP commands. The attacker needs a low privileged access to exploit the vulnerability.
    *   The provided CVSS vector string indicates the vulnerability requires some level of user interaction (UI:R), but the advisory text states it does not require user interaction and can be triggered with a remote access and low privileges which seems to be in conflict with the provided CVSS score..

**Additional Vulnerabilities (Not related to CVE-2018-7240):**

*   **Hard-coded Credentials (CVE-2018-7241):** The FTP server uses hard-coded credentials, potentially allowing unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the device's file transfer service, potentially leading to code execution or malicious firmware installation.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Network based, exploiting the FTP server functionality
    *  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Remote attacker with network access to the device, ability to access FTP service, and knowledge of the hardcoded credentials. Low privileges is required.

*   **Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm (CVE-2018-7242):** The FTP server uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm, which may cause a buffer overflow condition, likely due to the same root cause as CVE-2018-7240.
    *   **Impact:**  A successful exploit could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Network based, exploiting the FTP server functionality.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Remote attacker with network access to the device, ability to send crafted FTP commands. Low privileges is required.
