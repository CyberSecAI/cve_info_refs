- Privilege Escalation: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain management privileges of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote: The attack can be launched remotely over the network.
- Authentication Required: The attacker must have valid credentials to log in to the target device prior to exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated Access: The attacker needs to be able to authenticate to the target server's iBMC.
- Network Access: The attacker must have network connectivity to the target server.
