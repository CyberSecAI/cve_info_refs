- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application writes data from a file outside the bounds of the intended buffer space.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Memory corruption, potentially leading to remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Reading a specially crafted file that contains data designed to cause an out-of-bounds write.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted file to the vulnerable application, likely requiring user interaction to open/load this file. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, but requires user interaction (UI:R).
