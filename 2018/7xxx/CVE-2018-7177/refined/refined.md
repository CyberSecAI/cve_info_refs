Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL Injection flaw present in the `com_saxumnumerology` component of Joomla.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the application's database.
- This could lead to:
    - **Data Breaches:** Reading sensitive data from the database.
    - **Data Modification:** Modifying or deleting data within the database.
    - **Privilege Escalation:** Potentially gaining administrative access by manipulating user accounts.
    - **Complete System Compromise:** In some situations, depending on the database privileges, the attacker could execute system commands on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET parameter:**  The `publicid` parameter within the `index.php?option=com_saxumnumerology&view=savedresult` URL is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- **HTTP POST parameter:**  The `type_id` parameter within the POST request to `index.php?option=com_saxumnumerology&view=interpret` is also vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla application.
- No authentication is explicitly mentioned as required for the attack, so it's assumed to be exploitable without prior authentication.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit details provide two different methods of exploitation:
    1.  Using a crafted URL with a SQL injection payload in the `publicid` parameter.
    2.  Using a crafted HTML form which POSTS a base64 encoded SQL injection payload to `type_id` parameter.
