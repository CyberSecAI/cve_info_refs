CVE-2018-7538:

Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is caused by improper sanitization of user inputs when constructing SQL queries for tracker reports. Specifically, it occurs when a criteria is a cross-reference or a permissions-on-artifact field.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Blind SQL injection (time-based) in the tracker functionality of the Tuleap software.
- Improper input sanitization.

Impact of exploitation:
- A malicious user can inject arbitrary SQL commands.
- Successful exploitation can lead to:
  - Reading, modifying, or deleting data from the database.
  - Execution of arbitrary commands on the underlying system, depending on user privileges and the database engine in use.
  - Complete disclosure of all data on the system.
  - Spoofing identity, tampering with existing data, and causing repudiation issues.
  - Becoming an administrator of the database server.

Attack vectors:
- The vulnerability lies in the project tracker service search functionality.
- The attack can be performed by manipulating the "criteria[499][values][]" field in the request body with a SQL injection payload.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Depending on project visibility, successful exploitation may or may not require user authentication.
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests, typically using a proxy tool to intercept and modify the request.
- The attacker needs to have access to a tracker report.
