Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7588:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer over-read that occurs when loading crafted BMP images. Specifically, the issue lies within the `_load_bmp` function of the CImg library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer over-read. The code attempts to read beyond the allocated buffer size in heap memory when processing a specially crafted BMP image file, leading to out-of-bounds access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact of this vulnerability is the potential for arbitrary code execution. By exploiting the buffer over-read, an attacker could overwrite memory and potentially control the flow of the application. This is further supported by the Ubuntu security notice that indicates, "An attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code."

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted BMP image file. An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted BMP image which, when loaded by CImg, triggers the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide or trick the vulnerable application into loading a malicious BMP file. This could be achieved in several ways such as:
    - Embedding it in a website
    - Sending it as an attachment
    - Storing it in a location that the vulnerable application accesses.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability occurs when loading a crafted BMP image using `cimg_library::CImg::load_bmp`
- The `_load_bmp` function is implicated in the heap over-read.
- The address sanitizer output from the github issue report shows a read of size 1 at an address outside the allocated memory region, indicating the over-read.
- The Github issue #183 provides a test case for the vulnerability
- The issue was fixed in cimg version `1.5.9+dfsg-1+deb8u1` for Debian 8 "Jessie" and `1.7.9+dfsg-1+deb9u1` for Debian 9 stretch, and `1.7.9+dfsg-2ubuntu0.18.10.1` for Ubuntu 18.10 and `1.7.9+dfsg-2ubuntu0.18.04.1` for Ubuntu 18.04.

This information provides a detailed explanation of the vulnerability, its causes, and potential impacts, which aligns with the official description of CVE-2018-7588.
