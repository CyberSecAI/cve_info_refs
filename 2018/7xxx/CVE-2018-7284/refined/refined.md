Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-7284:

**Root Cause:**

- The `res_pjsip_pubsub` module in Asterisk fails to properly limit the number of "Accept" headers it processes from a SUBSCRIBE request. It attempts to store these headers, but has a fixed memory limit of 32 headers. If a SUBSCRIBE request includes more than 32 "Accept" headers, the code writes outside of its allocated memory causing a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code doesn't validate the number of "Accept" headers in a SIP SUBSCRIBE request, leading to a buffer overflow.
- **Fixed-size Buffer:** The module uses a fixed-size buffer to store the "Accept" headers, making it vulnerable to buffer overflow when the number of headers exceeds the buffer's capacity.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can send a crafted SUBSCRIBE request with a large number of "Accept" headers to crash the Asterisk service.
- **Potential Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Analysis suggests the stack corruption could be potentially exploited for remote code execution although not explicitly verified in provided content.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Sending a malicious SIP `SUBSCRIBE` request with more than 32 `Accept` headers to the asterisk server.
- The attack vector requires sending a specially crafted SIP message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send SIP messages to the vulnerable Asterisk server.
- The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated if the `SUBSCRIBE` request is unauthenticated. However, if authentication is required, the attacker must provide valid credentials or bypass the authentication process.

**Additional Details:**

- This vulnerability affects multiple versions of Asterisk, including 13.x, 14.x, 15.x and Certified Asterisk 13.18
- The vulnerability can be triggered by sending more than 32 `Accept` headers, and further analysis shows stack smashing can be achieved by sending 64 `Accept` headers with a length of 100 bytes
- The exploit can be delivered over TCP or TLS. It may not work reliably over UDP due to packet limitations.

**Resolution:**

- The vulnerability was fixed by enforcing a limit on the maximum number of Accept headers processed by the `res_pjsip_pubsub` module.
- Users should upgrade to Asterisk versions 13.19.2, 14.7.6, 15.2.2 or Certified Asterisk 13.18-cert3 or apply the respective patches provided.
