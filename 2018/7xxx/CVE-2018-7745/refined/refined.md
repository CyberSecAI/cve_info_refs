Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7745:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper access control in the Cobub Razor application. Specifically, the application allows the creation of a superuser account and modification of channel data without requiring prior authentication or authorization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Authentication Bypass:** The application fails to enforce authentication for critical actions like creating user accounts and modifying channel information.
2.  **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):**  The exploit examples demonstrate the use of HTML forms to submit requests to the server. This indicates a lack of CSRF protection, which allows an attacker to trick a user's browser into performing unwanted actions on the vulnerable application.
3.  **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The ability to inject arbitrary code via the `channel_name` field shows that the application doesn't sanitize the user provided data, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Unauthorized User Creation:** Attackers can create new superuser accounts, granting them full administrative control over the application.
2.  **Code Execution:** By injecting malicious JavaScript into the `channel_name`, attackers can execute arbitrary code within the browser of any admin user who accesses the affected channel within the admin panel. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or further compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Malicious HTML Pages:** An attacker can craft a malicious HTML page containing a form that, when opened in a victim's browser, sends a request to the vulnerable application to create a superuser account.
2.  **Malicious Links:** Similarly, an attacker can embed the form to modify channel data into a malicious webpage or link, and trick admin users to click on it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Network Access to the Target System:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the Cobub Razor instance. This usually implies the target instance being accessible on the network.
2.  **Victim Interaction:** In order to create a new super user account, the victim has to load a malicious webpage containing the form. For XSS, the attacker does not need user interaction but an admin user needs to visit the affected channel in the admin panel after the malicious channel modification is performed by the attacker.

**Summary:**

CVE-2018-7745 is a critical vulnerability in Cobub Razor that allows attackers to create admin accounts and execute code by exploiting a combination of authentication bypass, CSRF, and stored XSS vulnerabilities. Successful exploitation allows complete control over the application, potentially impacting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and user data.
