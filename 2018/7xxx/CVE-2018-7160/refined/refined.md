- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Node.js inspector, a debugger protocol, was vulnerable to a DNS rebinding attack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability was caused by the debugger service not properly validating the `Host` header, allowing connections via a hostname. This allows bypassing same-origin-policy checks in web browsers.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution. A malicious website could connect to a Node.js process running with the debug port active, and execute arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious website, opened in a web browser on the same computer or another computer with network access to the computer running the vulnerable Node.js process, could exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to get a user to open a malicious website in a browser that can reach the machine running the vulnerable Node.js instance. The Node.js process needs to have the debug port active.
