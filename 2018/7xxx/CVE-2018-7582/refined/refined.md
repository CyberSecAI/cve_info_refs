```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The WebLog Expert Web Server Enterprise 9.4 crashes due to a long HTTP Accept header.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The software has a vulnerability that allows a remote attacker to crash the daemon by sending a specially crafted HTTP request with an overly long Accept header.
- Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service, causing the application to crash.
- Attack vectors: The attack vector is remote, through a network connection.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the target server on TCP port 9991. The attacker does not need any credentials.
