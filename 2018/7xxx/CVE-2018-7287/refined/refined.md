Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a missing check in the `ast_websocket_read()` function within Asterisk's `res_http_websocket` module. Specifically, the function doesn't verify if the `payload_len` is greater than 0 before calling the `ws_safe_read()` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code lacks proper validation of the WebSocket frame's payload length.
- **Infinite Loop:** When `ws_safe_read()` is called with a length argument of 0, it enters a busy loop. This loop continues indefinitely until the underlying socket is closed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service condition. By sending crafted WebSocket frames with a 0-sized payload, the attacker can force the Asterisk server to enter the infinite loop, consuming CPU resources and rendering the service unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious WebSocket Frames:** Attackers send specially crafted WebSocket frames containing a payload length of 0 to the vulnerable Asterisk server.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Asterisk server's WebSocket interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the Asterisk server's WebSocket port.
- **WebSocket Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of the WebSocket protocol to construct malicious frames with a 0-length payload.

**Additional Information:**

- **Affected Version:** The vulnerability was initially introduced with iostreams which is only present in Asterisk version 15. Therefore only Asterisk version 15 is affected. Although the vulnerability does not exist in version 13, it could be added in version 13 for cleanliness.
- **Fix:** The fix involves adding a check to ensure `payload_len` is greater than 0 before calling `ws_safe_read()`.
- **Security Advisory:** The issue was assigned the identifier AST-2018-006.
