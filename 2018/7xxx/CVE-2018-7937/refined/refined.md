- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient plug-in verification.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Plug-in signature bypass vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can obtain root permissions of the device and take full control of the device.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to trick a user into installing a malicious application. The malicious application contains a tampered plug-in which bypasses the insufficient signature verification.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute a malicious application that can trick a user into installing it. The attacker needs to tamper with a legitimate plug-in to create a malicious version.
