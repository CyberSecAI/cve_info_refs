Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7249:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a race condition in the `secdrv.sys` driver when handling IOCTL 0xCA002813. Specifically, a use-after-free occurs because the driver lacks synchronization mechanisms to protect a memory chunk while it's being accessed by different IOCTL calls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Use-After-Free:** A memory chunk allocated by IOCTL type 0x96 can be freed by IOCTL type 0x98 while IOCTL type 0x97 is still using it.
*   **Race Condition:** The timing between the calls to IOCTL types 0x97 and 0x98 is critical for triggering the use-after-free. The lack of synchronization allows the free operation to occur while the chunk is in use.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The driver doesn't properly validate the chunk after a free.
*   **No Synchronization:** The driver does not have synchronization mechanisms in place to prevent use-after-free conditions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an unprivileged attacker can execute arbitrary code in the kernel (ring 0), allowing for a complete takeover of the system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker could gain elevated privileges from a normal user by exploiting the vulnerable driver.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the vulnerable machine to send IOCTL requests to the `secdrv.sys` driver.
*   **IOCTL manipulation**: The attacker needs to craft specific IOCTL requests (0xCA002813) with specific types (0x96, 0x97, 0x98).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unprivileged User:** An unprivileged user on a vulnerable Windows system is capable of exploiting this vulnerability
*   **Knowledge of IOCTLs:** The attacker needs a basic knowledge of the vulnerable driver's IOCTLs and their operation.
*   **Ability to Send IOCTLs:** The attacker needs the ability to send DeviceIoControl commands to the driver.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability exists in `secdrv.sys` as shipped in Microsoft Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1 before KB3086255, and in Macrovision SafeDisc.
*   The IOCTL 0xCA002813 takes an input buffer, where the offset 0x4 represents the type of operation (0x96, 0x97 or 0x98).
    *   Type 0x96: Allocates a chunk of memory.
    *   Type 0x97: Uses previously allocated memory chunk to encrypt a user input buffer and calls a function pointer from the same memory chunk.
    *   Type 0x98: Frees a previously allocated memory chunk.
*   The exploitation involves:
    1.  Freeing all previous chunks to ensure operations happen on the same PagedPool chunk.
    2.  Spraying the PagedPool to create holes matching the allocation size (0x30 bytes).
    3.  Allocating a chunk with IOCTL type 0x96 in one of the holes.
    4.  Allocating a large user space buffer and sending an IOCTL type 0x97 request (to start a long encryption process).
    5.  Starting a new thread to send an IOCTL type 0x98 request (to free the allocated chunk).
    6.  Spraying the pool again after the free in order to replace the freed chunk with attacker controlled allocation, which contains a function pointer.
    7.  Setting the shellcode address to the function pointer offset in the attacker controlled allocation.
    8.  Waiting for the function pointer to be called from IOCTL type 0x97, executing the shellcode.
* The encryption routine in IOCTL 0x97 can be slow, thus ensuring the use-after-free can be reliably triggered.
* The use-after-free occurs at .text:00011B68, and the hijacked call happens at .text:00011B86.
