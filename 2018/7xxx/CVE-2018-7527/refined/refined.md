Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow. This occurs when a program writes data beyond the allocated buffer on the stack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CWE-121:** Stack-based Buffer Overflow. The software does not properly validate the size of input data before copying it into a fixed-size buffer on the stack, leading to a potential overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution. By overflowing the buffer, an attacker could overwrite return addresses on the stack and redirect program execution to injected malicious code.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector involves opening a specially crafted file with the vulnerable software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker needs to craft a malicious file that exploits the buffer overflow. The content indicates that the vulnerability is not exploitable remotely, implying that the attacker needs to get the crafted file to be opened by a user with the vulnerable software installed. The vulnerability is described as low skill level to exploit.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The affected products include WECON LeviStudioU Version 1.10 (and prior within Wecon LeviStudioU 1.8.29) and PI Studio HMI Project Programmer Build: November 11, 2017 (and prior).
*   The advisory states that there are no known public exploits specifically targeting these vulnerabilities.
*   The provided CVSS v3 vector string is `AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L`, which translates to:
    *   **AV:L (Attack Vector: Local):**  An attacker must have local access to the vulnerable system.
    *   **AC:L (Attack Complexity: Low):** Exploitation is easily achievable.
    *   **PR:N (Privileges Required: None):** No special privileges are required to perform the attack.
    *   **UI:N (User Interaction: None):** No user interaction is required to perform the attack.
    *   **S:U (Scope: Unchanged):** The vulnerability does not impact resources outside the security scope managed by the security authority.
    *   **C:L (Confidentiality Impact: Low):** Limited impact on confidentiality; some sensitive information might be exposed.
    *   **I:L (Integrity Impact: Low):** Limited impact on integrity; some data might be modified.
    *  **A:L (Availability Impact: Low):** Limited impact on availability; the system might experience a minor disruption.
*   The advisory recommends updating to the latest version of the software from the vendor and implementing general security best practices.
