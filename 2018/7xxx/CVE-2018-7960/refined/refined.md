- **Root cause of vulnerability:**
    - The vulnerability exists in how the SRTP icon is displayed in Huawei eSpace product.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - The vulnerability is related to the SRTP icon display mechanism, where an attacker can intercept packets in non-secure mode.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - An attacker can intercept and tamper with call information, leading to sensitive information leaks.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - A remote, unauthenticated attacker can launch a man-in-the-middle attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the affected eSpace product and other communicating parties.
    - The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
    - The device needs to not have secure transmission mode enabled.
