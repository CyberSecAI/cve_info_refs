Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7486:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the combination of two main weaknesses in Mura CMS versions prior to 7.0.7029:

1.  **Local File Inclusion (LFI) via `[m][/m]` tags:** The Mura CMS content editor allows the inclusion of Mura functions within content using `[m][/m]` tags. Specifically, the `$.dspInclude()` and `$.dspTemplateInclude()` functions can include files relative to the application path. This functionality is vulnerable to directory traversal attacks because it doesn't validate the path or file extension, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server.
2.  **Unrestricted File Upload:** The CKFinder plugin allows uploading files without sufficient content sanitization. Although file extensions and MIME types are checked, it's possible to upload image files containing embedded malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** Improper input validation allows including arbitrary local files by manipulating the file paths within `$.dspInclude()` and `$.dspTemplateInclude()` functions.
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** Insufficient content sanitization allows uploading files with malicious code (e.g., an image with CFM code embedded).
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The combination of LFI and malicious file upload allows arbitrary code execution by including uploaded files with malicious code as part of rendered Mura application content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker can read any file on the server accessible by the webserver user. This can lead to sensitive information disclosure (e.g., configuration files, credentials, source code).
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can upload and include malicious CFM code (e.g., webshell) and execute arbitrary commands on the server. This would compromise the server and allow further attacks.
*   **Full Compromise:** Successful RCE can lead to complete compromise of the server and the entire application.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Local File Inclusion:** An attacker crafts malicious `[m]` tags with directory traversal to include arbitrary local files.
2.  **Malicious File Upload:** An attacker uploads an image file containing embedded malicious CFM code.
3.  **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker uploads a malicious file and then uses LFI via `$.dspInclude()` or `$.dspTemplateInclude()` to include the malicious file, triggering code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Administrator Privileges:** Exploitation of all vulnerabilities requires administrator access to Mura CMS to use the content editor and CKFinder file upload functionality.
*   **Knowledge of Mura CMS:** The attacker needs to know how to use Mura CMS' content editor and `[m]` tags, as well as how to use the `$.dspInclude()` and `$.dspTemplateInclude()` functions.
*  **Upload functionality:** Attacker must have the ability to upload files via the CKFinder plugin.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided blog post includes examples of how the LFI and RCE vulnerabilities can be exploited, including screenshots of the attacks in action.
*   The blog post also details the timeline of responsible disclosure and mitigation efforts with the Mura CMS developers (BlueRiver), highlighting the challenges in completely fixing the vulnerabilities.
*   The initial fix by BlueRiver was insufficient, and the blog author found that RCE was still possible using other file types.
*   The final mitigation provided was removing Mura tag functionality and sanitizing file types, with a recommendation to limit CKFinder to sanitized file types and disable Mura tags if other types are needed.
