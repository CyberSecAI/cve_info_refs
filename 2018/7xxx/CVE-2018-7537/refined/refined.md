  "CVE-2018-7537": {
    "description": "The django.utils.text.Truncator's chars() and words() methods, when passed the html=True argument, were extremely slow to evaluate certain inputs due to a catastrophic backtracking vulnerability in a regular expression. The chars() and words() methods are used to implement the truncatechars_html and truncatewords_html template filters, which were thus vulnerable.",
    "root_cause": "A catastrophic backtracking vulnerability in a regular expression within the `django.utils.text.Truncator`'s `chars()` and `words()` methods.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Catastrophic backtracking vulnerability",
      "Inefficient regular expression processing"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive resource consumption and slow evaluation of inputs when the `html=True` parameter is used.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted input strings to `django.utils.text.Truncator`'s `chars()` and `words()` methods with `html=True`"
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to control the input passed to the vulnerable functions."
