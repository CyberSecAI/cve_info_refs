# [R1] Multiple Schneider Electric Modicon Quantum Vulnerabilities

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

Tenable found multiple vulnerabilities in the Schneider Electric Quantum Modicon [140 NOC 771 01 Ethernet Module](https://www.schneider-electric.us/en/product/140NOC77101/modicon-quantum-ethernet-comunication-module---rj45---10-100-mbit-s/).

#### CVE-2018-7809: Unauthenticated Password Reset

An unauthenticated remote attacker can delete the existing username and password for the HTTP server by visiting the following URL:

```

http://[ip]/unsecure/embedded/builtin?submit=Delete%20Password

```

This also has the side affect of resetting the web server username and password to the default USER/USER.

#### CVE-2018-7810: Reflected XSS

A reflected XSS vulnerability exists in the HTTP server's endpoint */goform/formTest*. A remote attacker can insert Javascript into the **name** parameter that will be executed in the context of the person who followed the link. An example follows:

```

http://[ip]/goform/formTest?name=<script>alert()</script>

```
#### CVE-2018-7811: Unauthenticated Password Change

The web server allows an authenticated remote user to change their password via the */secure/embedded/builtin* endpoint. The web server also lets an unauthenticated remote attacker change user's passwords via the */unsecure/embedded/builtin* endpoint. An example URL that changes the admin user's password to **evilpass** follows:

```

http://[ip]/unsecure/embedded/builtin?Language=English&user=admin&passwd=evilpass&cnfpasswd=evilpass&subhttppwd=Save+User

```
#### CVE-2018-7830: Unauthenticated Remote Denial of Service

A denial of service occurs when an unauthenticated remote attacker sends an HTTP request with no "\r\n\r\n" terminator. This will render the web server useless for ~1 minute The following is a one line proof of concept:

```

echo -e "GET /index.htm HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: 192.168.248.30" | nc 192.168.248.30 80

```
#### CVE-2018-7831: Cross-site request forgery

The password change functionality is implemented with an HTTP GET request in which the new password is specified. An anti-forgery token is not required to validate the request. Furthermore, the current password does not need to be specified in order to complete a password change. An attacker can forge a link to be sent to an authenticated victim. Once clicked, the password will be changed. Example URL:

```

http://[ip]/secure/embedded/builtin?Language=English&user=admin&passwd=evilpass&cnfpasswd=evilpass&subhttppwd=Save+User

```
#### Others

Tenable reported seven vulnerabilities to Schneider Electric. Schneider indicated one of our vulnerabilities (default accounts) was a duplicate and the other (modbus denial of service) was not a vulnerability. However, we've decided to document them here.

##### Default FTP Accounts We found a handful of default FTP accounts. Some passwords we used required use of a [VxHash collision](https://blog.rapid7.com/2010/08/02/shiny-old-vxworks-vulnerabilities/) disclosed by H.D. Moore in 2010. | Username | Password | | --- | --- | | sysdiag | factorycast@schneider | | fdrusers | sresurdf | | fwupgrade | FaAmU5p2F~ | | loki | ZfTljublsx | Modbus Denial of Service Modbus is accessible over TCP port 502. Tenable found that the following unauthenticated remote Modbus message will completely shutdown the Ethernet module: ``` echo -ne "\x0\xa8\x0\x0\x0\x5\x0\x5a\x0\x7\x0" | nc 192.168.238.30 502 ```

### Solution

No patches for these vulnerabilities exist. However, in their [advisory](https://www.schneider-electric.com/en/download/document/SEVD-2018-327-01/), Schneider Electric advises customers to follow their *[Modicon Controllers Platform Cyber Security Reference Manual](https://media.distributordatasolutions.com/schneider/2016q2/d5b1c8dc2ba82c76bce73d1ef060d2c2e5421eb4)*. They also recommend customers configure access control lists and "protect Modicon products with network, industrial, and application firewalls."
