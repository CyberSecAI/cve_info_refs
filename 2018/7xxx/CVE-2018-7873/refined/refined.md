Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7873:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `getString` function in `util/decompile.c` attempts to print a 32-bit integer into a fixed-size 10-character buffer using `sprintf`. A 32-bit integer can have 10 digits and a sign, exceeding the buffer's capacity and leading to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The `getString` function allocates a 10-byte buffer on the heap. When a large integer is converted to a string and written into this buffer, the output may exceed the allocated size.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The heap buffer overflow can lead to a crash or unpredictable behavior, causing a denial of service.  As shown in the ASAN output, the overflow overwrites adjacent heap memory, potentially corrupting data structures.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Crafted SWF file:**  The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted SWF file that includes action records leading to the execution of the vulnerable `getString` function with a large integer parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a malformed SWF file to a system utilizing the vulnerable `libming` library.  This might involve tricking a user into opening the file or exploiting an application that processes such files.

**Additional notes:**

- The provided content details the fix in commit `6631f9b`, which is part of a larger effort to address multiple security issues.
- The fix was backported to Fedora and Debian LTS.
- The github issue [libming#111](https://github.com/libming/libming/issues/111) provides a detailed ASAN output and a proof of concept SWF file.
- The issue was initially reported by `fantasy7082`.
- The fix was implemented by `hlef`.
