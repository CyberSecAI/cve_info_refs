- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper authentication design in the iBMC (Intelligent Baseboard Management Controller) of some Huawei servers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability lies in how the iBMC authenticates login messages, allowing low-privileged users to potentially bypass security measures.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit allows a low-privileged user to obtain or modify the passwords of highly privileged users. This could lead to complete control over the server.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker sends specially crafted login messages to the affected server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a low-privileged user account and network access to the server.
