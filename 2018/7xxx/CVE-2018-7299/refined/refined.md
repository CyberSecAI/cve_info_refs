{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of addon packages uploaded to the HomeMatic CCU2. Specifically, the `update_script` file within an addon package is executed without sufficient security checks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unrestricted file upload",
       "Unvalidated execution of scripts",
        "Lack of input sanitization",
       "Insufficient access control on uploaded files."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system. This includes creating or overwriting files, installing malicious software, and potentially taking complete control of the device.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through the web interface of the HomeMatic CCU2. An authenticated user can upload a specially crafted addon package containing a malicious `update_script` file.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the HomeMatic CCU2 web interface. They do not need to be on the same network as the CCU2, they can do it via the internet."
