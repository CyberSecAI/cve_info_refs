Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-7901:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is located in the RCS (Rich Communication Services) module of certain Huawei smartphones.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The core issue is a remote control vulnerability within the RCS module.
- An attacker can potentially control the keyboard remotely by exploiting this flaw.
- The authentication mechanism for applications using RCS appears to have a weakness, allowing an attacker to gain access if they obtain a specific key.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to remotely control the device's keyboard.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack requires tricking a user into installing a malicious application.
- The malicious application must connect to RCS. The user will be prompted to manually agree to the connection.
- The attacker needs to obtain the key used by RCS to authenticate the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to develop and distribute a malicious application.
- The attacker needs to obtain the authentication key for RCS.
- The attacker needs to convince a victim to install the malicious application and manually approve the RCS connection.
