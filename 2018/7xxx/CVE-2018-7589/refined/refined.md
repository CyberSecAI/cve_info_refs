Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7589:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a double free error in the `CImg` library when processing crafted BMP images.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Double Free:** The vulnerability is a classic double free, where memory that has already been freed is attempted to be freed again. This leads to memory corruption and program instability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** As mentioned in the Ubuntu Security Notice (USN), successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. This can be achieved by manipulating the heap to overwrite data structures, including function pointers, so that they are redirected to malicious code.
- **Denial of service:** Even if arbitrary code execution is not possible, the double free can cause the application to crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious image file:** The primary attack vector involves loading a specially crafted BMP image. This could be done through various means, like opening the image in an application that uses the vulnerable CImg library, or by processing an image received over a network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to provide a crafted BMP image:** The attacker must be able to supply a crafted BMP image to the vulnerable application. This could be done by convincing a user to load the image, or by delivering the image through an automated process if the application is processing user submitted images or network traffic.
- **No special access needed:** The attacker doesn't need any special privileges on the system, other than the ability to supply the crafted image file.

**Additional details:**
- **Vulnerable function**: The double free occurs during the loading of BMP images, specifically in the function `cimg_library::CImg<unsigned char>::_load_bmp`.
- **Source code**: The specific location of the double-free is mentioned as line 48467 of `CImg.h`
- **Affected versions**: The vulnerability affects CImg versions prior to the fixes introduced in the security updates for Ubuntu and Debian.
- **Patch**: The vulnerability was addressed in the Debian LTS update DLA-1934-1 and DLA-2421-1 as well as the Ubuntu security update USN-4039-1
