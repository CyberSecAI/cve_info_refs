Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-7704:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is the incomplete implementation of authorization checks within the SecurEnvoy SecurMail application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The application fails to properly verify if a user is authorized to access a specific resource (in this case, emails). Specifically, the functionality that allows a user to reply to an email can be manipulated to access other user's emails by changing the message ID.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker (a legitimate recipient) can read emails sent to other users in plain text.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  By manipulating the message ID parameter in the URL of the reply functionality of the application, an attacker can access emails of other users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a legitimate recipient with access to the SecurEnvoy SecurMail web interface.
- The attacker must know or be able to guess the message IDs of other users' emails. The advisory mentions that message IDs are assigned sequentially which makes them easily predictable.

**Technical Details:**
- The advisory provides a specific URL example: `http://<host>/secmail/getmessage.exe?mailboxid=<mailboxid>&action=reply&option1=103`
- By changing the `option1` parameter to the ID of a different user's email, the attacker can access that email.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities found in SecurEnvoy SecurMail 9.1.501.
- The advisory recommends applying the security patch "1_012018" or upgrading to version 9.2.501 to fix this issue.
