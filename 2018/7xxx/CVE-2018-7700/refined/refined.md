Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-7700

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a combination of a flawed CSRF check and insecure handling of user-supplied input within the DedeCMS backend, specifically in the `/dede/tag_test_action.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CSRF Bypass:** The `csrf_check()` function in `/dede/config.php` only checks if a token is present and if it matches the session token. However, the session token is not generated upon login, meaning it is null. An attacker can bypass the CSRF check by providing an empty token parameter, e.g., `?token=`.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** After bypassing the CSRF check, the `$partcode` variable is processed and ultimately used to generate and execute PHP code. This is achieved through a series of function calls in `PartView` and `DedeTagParse` classes, specifically in the `Runphp` method. The vulnerability arises because the provided template code is not properly sanitized and is executed directly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server with the same privileges as the web server process.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Depending on server configuration and access permissions, this can potentially lead to complete server compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint, `/dede/tag_test_action.php`.
*   **Manipulated Parameters:** The attack exploits the lack of proper CSRF protection and uses the `partcode` parameter to inject malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be logged into the DedeCMS backend to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker must know the path to the vulnerable file `/dede/tag_test_action.php`.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Payload:** The attacker needs to be able to create a payload that is properly formatted according to the DedeCMS template syntax and include the `runphp='yes'` tag, enabling PHP code execution.

**Payload Example:**
```
http://localhost/后台地址/tag_test_action.php?url=a&token=&partcode={dede:field name='source' runphp='yes'}phpinfo();{/dede:field}
```
This payload will execute the `phpinfo()` function on the server.

**Solution (from content):**
*   The provided solution suggests to "reimplement `csrf_check()` function", which essentially means to properly generate and validate CSRF tokens upon login.

**Additional Information:**
*   The content provides a detailed breakdown of the code flow and execution path leading to the arbitrary code execution vulnerability.
*   The content explains the role of DedeCMS template syntax in exploiting the vulnerability.
*   The content suggests an approach for a proper fix, highlighting the need for proper CSRF token implementation.
