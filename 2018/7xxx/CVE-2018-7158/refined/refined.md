Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7158:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `'path'` module of Node.js 4.x. Specifically, the regular expression `splitPathRe`, used in various path parsing functions (`path.dirname()`, `path.extname()`, `path.parse()`), is susceptible to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The regular expression `splitPathRe` is not efficient when processing specific crafted strings. This allows an attacker to provide input that will take a long time to evaluate, leading to a denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit can cause a denial of service (DoS). By crafting a malicious input string and passing it to the vulnerable functions, an attacker can tie up the server resources, making the application unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted string to the vulnerable functions in the `path` module. This could be done through user input, file paths, or other means where input is processed by the vulnerable `path` functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs the ability to control or influence the input string that is processed by the vulnerable path functions in a Node.js 4.x application. This could be done remotely or locally depending on how the application handles path inputs.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability is specific to Node.js 4.x. The code was replaced in Node.js 6.x and later, making those versions immune.
- The vulnerability is rated as HIGH severity due to the potential for DoS.
- This vulnerability was reported by James Davis of Virginia Tech.
