- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the Factory Reset Protection (FRP) mechanism of some Huawei smartphones. An attacker can bypass FRP by connecting the phone to a PC and sending specific commands to install a third-party desktop environment, and disable the boot wizard during device reconfiguration.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass the FRP lock via ADB commands sent from a connected PC. The FRP is intended to prevent unauthorized access after a factory reset and this vulnerability bypasses that protection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the FRP lock, effectively gaining unauthorized access to the phone after a factory reset.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack requires a physical connection to a PC and the ability to send specific ADB commands to the device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs physical access to the smartphone and the technical know-how to use ADB to send commands from a connected PC.
