  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Insecure handling of user-supplied input leading to OS command injection, arbitrary file upload, and SQL injection vulnerabilities.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "OS Command Injection: Improper sanitization of the 'file_name' parameter in /api/file_uploader.php and /actions/file_downloader.php allows an attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands.",
      "Arbitrary File Upload: Lack of authentication and proper file type validation in /actions/beats_uploader.php, /actions/photo_uploader.php, and edit_account.php enables arbitrary file uploads.",
      "Blind SQL Injection: Insufficient sanitization of parameters like 'channelId', 'email', and 'username' in /actions/vote_channel.php and /ajax/commonAjax.php allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to full compromise of the web server, including potential exposure of sensitive data, and arbitrary command execution on the underlying OS and database server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP requests with manipulated parameters ('file_name', 'file', 'channelId', 'email', 'username').",
      "Unauthenticated access to vulnerable endpoints (/api/file_uploader.php, /actions/beats_uploader.php, /actions/photo_uploader.php, /actions/vote_channel.php, /ajax/commonAjax.php).",

       "Uploading malicious files."
