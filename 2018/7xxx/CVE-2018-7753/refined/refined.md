Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from improper sanitization of URI values within HTML attributes when these values contain character entities. Specifically, the `bleach` library failed to properly handle character entities within URI values, allowing malicious schemes to bypass sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Improper URI Sanitization:** The core issue is that the library's sanitization logic did not fully decode or account for character entities within URI values.
- **Bypass of Allowed Schemes:** By using character entities, an attacker could encode disallowed URI schemes (e.g., `javascript:`) in a way that would pass through the sanitization process, when it should be filtered out.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By injecting malicious URI values, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code within a user's browser, leading to a variety of XSS attacks like:
    - Stealing cookies or session tokens.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the website or application.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Other Malicious Activities:** Depending on the context of the application, there might be other potential consequences like data manipulation or information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTML Attribute Injection:** The primary attack vector involves injecting malicious HTML code that includes attributes with crafted URI values using character entities.
- **User Input:** This vulnerability would likely be exploited when user-provided HTML content is processed with the vulnerable version of the `bleach` library without sufficient sanitization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Inject HTML:** The attacker needs the ability to inject HTML into a website or application that uses the `bleach` library for sanitization. This could be through forms, comments, or any other input field that allows HTML markup.
- **Knowledge of Character Entities:** The attacker must be aware of how to use character entities to encode disallowed URI schemes effectively.
- **Target System Running Vulnerable Version:** The target system or application must be running a version of `bleach` prior to 2.1.3 for the exploit to succeed.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was introduced in `bleach` version 2.1.
- The fix was implemented in version 2.1.3.
- The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2018-7753.
- The fix includes changes to the `sanitize_uri_value` function in `bleach/sanitizer.py` to properly handle character entities, as well as the inclusion of new test cases.
