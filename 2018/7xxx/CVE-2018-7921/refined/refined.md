Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Huawei B315s-22 router's web application allows unauthenticated access to sensitive files and token generation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Information Leak:** Unauthenticated access to sensitive files such as `/config/deviceinformation/config.xml`, `/config/dialup/config.xml`, etc. These files contain device information, potentially including serial numbers, IMEI, IMSI, ICCID, MSISDN, hardware and software versions, and other configuration details.
2.  **Unauthenticated Token Generation:** Unauthenticated users can generate valid `SessionID` and `__RequestVerificationToken` tokens by sending a GET request to `/api/webserver/SesTokInfo`. These tokens can then be used to access restricted resources on the router.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
1.  **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive device information, potentially leading to further attacks or unauthorized use of the device.
2.  **Access to Restricted Resources:** Using the generated tokens, an attacker can access restricted resources on the router, which could potentially lead to unauthorized configuration changes or further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Adjacent Network:** An attacker on the same network as the vulnerable device can send HTTP GET requests directly to the router's web interface. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
*   **HTTP Requests:** The attack is performed using standard HTTP GET requests. No special protocols or techniques are required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be on the same network (adjacent) as the vulnerable Huawei B315s-22 router.
*   No authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
*   Basic understanding of sending HTTP requests is required.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vendor (Huawei) initially considered the impact of the information leak vulnerability to be low and marked it as a non-vulnerability, but eventually issued a fix and CVE.
*   The researcher who discovered the vulnerability was Usman Saeed.
*   The vulnerability affects firmware version `21.318.01.00.26` of the Huawei B315s-22 router.
*   A fix has been provided to the affected carriers, and users should receive a system update prompt.

This information provides more detail than the official CVE description, including specific vulnerable endpoints, the type of information exposed, and how to obtain authentication tokens to access restricted resources.
