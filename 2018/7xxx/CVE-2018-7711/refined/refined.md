{
  "CVE-2018-7711": {
    "Root cause": "The `validateSignature()` method in the `HTTPRedirect` class of the SAML2 library incorrectly handles the return value of the `verifySignature()` method, which in turn calls `openssl_verify()`. `openssl_verify()` returns 1 for successful verification, 0 for failure, and -1 for an error. The code was implicitly converting these integer values to boolean, which resulted in the error state (-1) being interpreted as a successful verification (true).",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Incorrect handling of return values from `openssl_verify()` leading to improper signature validation.",
      "Implicit boolean conversion of error codes."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could craft or modify SAML 2 messages with invalid signatures, and due to the faulty signature validation, the messages would be accepted as valid. This could lead to impersonation of any user at a service provider.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by manipulating the context of the signature validation process, including using a DSA key when an RSA key is expected, using an RSA key when a DSA key is expected, or by exhausting the service provider's memory during the signature validation process. Though the DSA key related vectors are not applicable under normal circumstances (as the software only supports RSA), they are possible through misconfiguration or social engineering. The memory exhaustion vector is difficult to exploit due to timing constraints.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the SAML 2 messages and, in some scenarios, the attacker needs to trigger a validation error on the service provider. Exploitation could be made easier if the attacker can social engineer or misconfigure the Service Provider to accept a DSA public key. The attacker must also be targeting a service provider with registered metadata for the Identity Provider they wish to impersonate."
