Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   Multiple dissectors in Wireshark contained flaws that could lead to large or infinite loops. These flaws were primarily present in ASN.1 BER dissectors and others such as DICOM, DMP, LLTD, OpenFlow, RELOAD, RPCoRDMA, RPKI-Router, S7COMM, SCCP, Thread, Thrift, USB, and WCCP dissectors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Infinite Loops:** The primary vulnerability was the potential for dissectors to enter infinite loops due to malformed or specially crafted packets. This was caused by flaws in the parsing logic of dissectors.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could cause Wireshark to consume excessive CPU resources, effectively causing a denial-of-service condition. This could be achieved by:
    *   Injecting malformed packets onto a network being monitored by Wireshark.
    *   Convincing a user to open a malformed packet trace file.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Injection:** Malicious actors could inject crafted packets into a network being captured by Wireshark.
*   **Malicious Packet Trace Files:** Attackers could distribute malicious packet capture files that trigger the vulnerability when opened in Wireshark.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** For network injection, the attacker needs the ability to inject traffic into a network being monitored by Wireshark.
*   **Social Engineering:** For malicious capture files, an attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious capture file.

**Additional Details**

*   The vulnerability affects Wireshark versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.4 and 2.2.0 to 2.2.12.
*   The issue was resolved in Wireshark versions 2.4.5 and 2.2.13.
*   Multiple CVEs were issued as a result of these issues (CVE-2018-7321 to CVE-2018-7333).
*   One specific case of this issue was found in the SCCP dissector, as mentioned in bug report 14413, and is directly linked to CVE-2018-7324.
*   Debian LTS also issued security advisories DLA 1353-1 and DLA 1634-1 to address this vulnerability and other related issues, covering multiple CVEs including CVE-2018-7324.
