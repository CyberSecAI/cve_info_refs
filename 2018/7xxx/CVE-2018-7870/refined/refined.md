Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7870:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an invalid memory address dereference in the `getString` function within `util/decompile.c` when processing CONSTANT16 data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Invalid memory address dereference.
- The issue occurs within the `getString` function when handling CONSTANT16 data, which suggests a flaw in how memory pointers or offsets are calculated or validated when processing this specific type of constant data in the SWF file format.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS). An attacker can trigger a crash by providing a crafted SWF file, causing the program to terminate abruptly.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves supplying a maliciously crafted SWF file as input to the vulnerable program (`swftocxx`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to provide a specially crafted SWF file to the vulnerable application. This could be achieved by having the user open a malicious SWF file or by processing such a file through an application using the vulnerable library.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is located in `util/decompile.c` specifically within the `getString` function. This provides a narrow scope for analyzing the code for potential issues.
- The issue was identified using AddressSanitizer (ASAN), a memory error detector.
- The provided PoC file in the github issue `https://github.com/fantasy7082/image_test/blob/master/009-unknown-def-swf` can be used to reproduce the issue.
- Debian's security advisory (DLA 1343-1) confirms that this vulnerability has been addressed in version 0.4.4-1.1+deb7u8 of the `ming` package.
- This vulnerability is one of several reported within the same timeframe for the `libming` library.
