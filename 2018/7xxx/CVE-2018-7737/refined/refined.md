Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7737:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a result of the application disclosing the full physical path of the web server in error messages. This occurs when specific PHP files within the Z-Blog installation are accessed directly through the browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Full Path Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of the server's physical file system path via error messages. This occurs because the application directly outputs error messages that contain the full file paths.
*   Lack of Proper Error Handling: The application does not handle errors in a way that prevents sensitive information disclosure. Instead, it reveals the full path in the error message when certain PHP files are accessed directly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** An attacker can gain knowledge of the server's file system structure, including the location of application files, configuration files, etc. This information could potentially assist in further attacks, such as exploiting other vulnerabilities.
*   **Increased Attack Surface:** Knowing the exact path allows attackers to target specific files or directories which might contain more vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability can be triggered by directly accessing specific PHP files in the Z-Blog installation via HTTP requests. The provided proof of concept (PoC) URLs demonstrate this.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker only needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable Z-Blog installation.
*   **No Authentication Required:**  The vulnerability can be triggered without needing to authenticate or have any specific access privileges to the system, which makes it easier to exploit.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vendor disputes that this issue is a vulnerability as the information disclosed is not considered particularly sensitive.
*   The vulnerability is considered a low-risk issue.
*   The issue was reported to the vendor and was resolved along with CVE-2018-6846.
*   The provided URLs demonstrate the potential for a full path disclosure.
*   This vulnerability was reported to the vendor and was fixed in a later release.
