Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7052:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is caused by a null pointer dereference that occurs when the number of windows in Irssi exceeds the available space.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-690:**  Unchecked cast or conversion to a base type, leading to a null pointer dereference.
*   **Null Pointer Dereference:** The software attempts to dereference a null pointer, resulting in a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Exploiting the vulnerability leads to a crash of the Irssi client, causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by causing the Irssi client to open a large number of windows, exceeding the application's capacity to handle them.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the Irssi client in a way that they can trigger the creation of many windows. This could potentially be achieved by sending commands to the client, or by manipulating the client's configuration.
*  The vulnerability depends on a non-default configuration, implying the default configuration might be safe.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects all Irssi versions observed at the time of discovery.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Joseph Bisch.
*   The issue is fixed in Irssi versions 1.0.7 and 1.1.1.
