Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to an SQL Injection flaw in the `publicid` parameter of the `com_saxumpicker` component within Joomla.
* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize the `publicid` parameter before using it in a database query.
* **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL queries. This can lead to:
    *   Data breaches, allowing access to sensitive information stored in the database.
    *   Data modification or deletion.
    *   Potentially gaining control of the application and the server.
* **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable URL of the application by manipulating the `publicid` parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target Joomla instance.
    *   No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability in the publicid parameter.

**Technical Details**
The provided proof-of-concept (POC) URL demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability:
`http://localhost/Joomla375/index.php?option=com_saxumpicker&view=savedspread&publicid=1' AND EXTRACTVALUE(66,CONCAT(0x5c,CONCAT_WS(0x203a20,USER(),DATABASE(),VERSION()),(SELECT (ELT(66=66,1)))))-- -`

This crafted URL injects SQL code using the `publicid` parameter which will then be executed against the database.
The `EXTRACTVALUE` function is used to display the results of the query to extract user, database, and version information.
