- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A vulnerability exists in the radio module of some Huawei smartphones that allows an attacker to bypass the lock screen.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  A lock-screen bypass vulnerability in the radio module.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can start a third-party input method application, potentially gaining access to the device without the screen lock password.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack requires physical access to the smartphone. The attacker must then perform certain operations to trigger the vulnerability and start the third-party input method app.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs physical access to the targeted Huawei smartphone. They do not need to be authenticated to the device.
