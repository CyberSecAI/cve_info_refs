Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-7281

**Root Cause:** The root cause of the vulnerability is the presence of a setuid root binary named `runme` within the CactusVPN for MacOS application. This binary takes a command line argument and passes it to the `system()` call without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Setuid Root Binary:** The `runme` binary is setuid root, meaning it executes with root privileges regardless of the user who invokes it.
*   **Unsanitized `system()` Call:** The binary passes user-supplied input directly to a `system()` call. This is a classic and dangerous coding pattern.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Root Privilege Escalation:** A low-privileged user can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges. This allows an attacker to gain complete control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Execution:** An attacker must have local access to the machine where the vulnerable CactusVPN software is installed.
*   **Command Injection:** The attacker provides a malicious command as a command-line argument to the `runme` binary. This command is then executed with root privileges via the `system()` call.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   A low-privileged user account on a MacOS system where a vulnerable version of CactusVPN is installed (versions prior to 5.3.6)
*   Ability to execute the setuid binary `/Applications/CactusVPN.app/Contents/MacOS/runme` with command-line arguments

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Benjamin Watson of VerSprite Security.
*   CactusVPN has addressed the vulnerability in version 5.3.6 and later.
