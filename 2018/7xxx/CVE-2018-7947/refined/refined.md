- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in the debug mode of some Huawei mobile phones.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allows a malicious device to bypass certain authentication mechanisms when the target phone is in debug mode.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation may lead to the installation of malicious applications on the affected mobile phones.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack requires the user to connect to a malicious device while the phone is in debug mode. The malicious device then exploits the vulnerability to install malicious applications.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick the user into connecting to a malicious device and the target device must be in debug mode. The malicious device needs to contain software designed to exploit this vulnerability.
