Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7197:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied URLs in the blog reaction feature of the Pluck CMS. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize the URL field in user-submitted blog reactions, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. The unsanitized URL is saved within the system and then rendered later, resulting in the execution of the embedded JavaScript code within the context of the web application.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the vulnerable web application.
-   **Session and Credential Theft:**  An attacker can potentially steal session cookies or admin credentials of users visiting the affected blog posts, especially administrators when they edit the blog.
-   **Admin Panel Compromise:** The vulnerability can affect administrators who check the blog to edit or delete it, potentially leading to the theft of admin credentials and session, and possibly full compromise of the CMS.
-   **Targeted Attacks:** The vulnerability allows attackers to specifically target administrators, leading to a higher severity impact.

**Attack vectors:**

-   **User-submitted data:** The attacker provides malicious input via the URL field when submitting a blog reaction.
-   **Unsanitized URL:** The application does not sanitize the URL when storing or rendering it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   **Public access to the blog reaction form:** The attacker needs to be able to access the blog post's reaction form, which is publicly accessible.
-   **Ability to submit data:** The attacker must be able to submit a form with a crafted URL.
-   **No authentication required for initial injection:** The initial injection does not require admin privileges, but the exploit impacts logged in admins.

**Technical Details:**

The attacker inserts the following string into the URL field of the reaction form:
`http://google.com/?"> <svg/onload=confirm(document.domain)>`

This payload injects JavaScript code that, when rendered, will execute an alert box with the domain of the website. The same occurs for admins when checking the blog.

This allows for arbitrary JavaScript execution within the context of the website leading to full compromise.
