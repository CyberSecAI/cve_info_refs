For information about the new features in NetIQ Identity Manager Designer 4.7, see [NetIQ Identity Manager Designer 4.7 Release Notes](https://www.netiq.com/documentation/identity-manager-47/releasenotes_designer47/data/releasenotes_designer47.html).

There are no new features for NetIQ Identity Manager Analyzer 4.7 except the updated Java version. For more information, see [NetIQ Identity Manager Analyzer 4.7 Release Notes](https://www.netiq.com/documentation/identity-manager-47/releasenotes_analyzer47/data/releasenotes_analyzer47.html).

#### Simplified Installation on Linux Platforms

Identity Manager offers a new simplified and scripted installation program for Linux platforms. The new installation program supports interactive and silent methods for installing Identity Manager components. The installation process comprises of an install phase and a configuration phase. The install phase lays down the required binaries. The configuration phase configures the Identity Manager components. The new installer introduces typical and advanced configuration modes.

A typical configuration uses common defaults for most values and is suitable for quickly installing the product. Custom configuration is suited for production environments. The new installer also contains a utility to generate the silent property file in an interactive mode. The new installer does not support graphical user interface (GUI) installation method.

For information about downloading the installation files, see [Installing NetIQ Identity Manager 4.7](#t42axebjmb2n). For installation instructions, see the [NetIQ Identity Manager Setup Guide for Linux](../../setup_linux/data/front.html#front).

#### Uniform Auditing

Identity Manager introduces Common Event Format (CEF), an open log management standard, for auditing events across all Identity Manager components. CEF is an extensible, text-based format designed to support multiple device types by offering the most relevant information. Using CEF reduces the message syntaxes to work with Embedded Syslog Manager normalization. CEF defines a syntax for log records comprised of a standard header and a variable extension, formatted as key-value pairs.

CEF logging is disabled by default. To enable it, see [Configuring Identity Manager Components to Log Audit Events in CEF Format](../../configure_auditing/data/configure-identity-manager-components-to-use-cef.html#configure-identity-manager-components-to-use-cef) in the [NetIQ Identity Manager - Configuring Auditing in Identity Manager](../../configure_auditing/data/bookinfo.html#bookinfo).

*NOTE:*If you upgrade to Identity Manager 4.7, XDAS is still available for Identity Manager components except identity applications. NetIQ recommends to use CEF for auditing for all components. XDAS will be deprecated in the future.

#### Extended Support of Subscriber Service Channel for New Drivers

The Subscriber Service Channel support that was introduced for the JDBC Fan-Out driver in Identity Manager 4.6 has been extended to the following Identity Manager drivers in this release: Active Directory, Multi-Domain Active Directory, and JDBC.

The Subscriber Service Channel enables you to separately process the out-of-band queries without interrupting the normal flow of cached events. Examples of out-of-band queries are code map refresh queries, data collection queries and queries triggered from dxcmd. This helps to improve the performance of the driver while processing cached events.

For more information, see [Improving Driver Performance Using Subscriber Service Channel](../../driver_admin/data/t41hj9uznkpr.html#t41hj9uznkpr) in the [NetIQ Identity Manager Driver Administration Guide](../../driver_admin/data/bktitle.html#bktitle).

#### Simplified Permission Reconciliation Services

Permission Collection Reconciliation Services (PCRS) is simplified for Active Directory, Multi-Domain Active Directory (MDAD) and LDAP drivers. This implementation is known as Controlled Permission Reconciliation Services (CPRS).

In the new implementation, CPRS is integrated with Identity Manager Dashboard to assist you reconcile the connected systemâs permissions with identity applications. For more information, see [Using Controlled Permission Reconciliation Services](../../identity_apps_admin/data/netiq-identity-manager-cprs-controlled-permission-reconciliation-services.html#netiq-identity-manager-cprs-controlled-permission-reconciliation-services) in the [NetIQ Identity Manager - Administratorâs Guide to the Identity Applications](../../identity_apps_admin/data/bookinfo.html#bookinfo).

Identity Manager supports migrating permissions from PCRS to CPRS for Active Directory, MDAD, and LDAP drivers. For other Identity Manager drivers, you can continue using PCRS. For more information, see [Migrating to CPRS](../../identity_apps_admin/data/netiq-identity-manager-migrate-to-cprs.html#netiq-identity-manager-migrate-to-cprs) in the [NetIQ Identity Manager - Administratorâs Guide to the Identity Applications](../../identity_apps_admin/data/bookinfo.html#bookinfo).

#### Changed Access to Identity Manager Data Collection Services

Identity Manager introduces a new web page to access Data Collection Services (DCS). You can directly launch the DCS page from the identity applications user interface or access it from a browser. This is a step towards making the user interface consistent across Identity Manager components.

The DCS page allows you to configure the settings for the connected systems that you want to report, and provide information for Identity Reporting. For more information, see [Exploring Identity Manager Data Collections Services](../../report_setup/data/t44brvqgir6z.html#t44brvqgir6z) in the [Administrator Guide to NetIQ Identity Reporting](../../report_setup/data/bookinfo.html#bookinfo).

#### Ability to Filter Entitlement Events of Other Drivers

With this release, events on DirXMLEntitlement-Ref attribute contain only the entitlement changes of that particular driver. This functionality can be controlled by a new Engine Control Value, Ignore Entitlement Changes of other drivers. For more information, see [Engine Control Values](../../driver_admin/data/b94psjw.html#b94psjw) in the [NetIQ Identity Manager Driver Administration Guide](../../driver_admin/data/bktitle.html#bktitle).

#### New Features and Enhancements in Identity Applications

The Identity Applications component includes the following new features and enhancements:

##### Support for Helpdesk

Identity Manager introduces a new Helpdesk feature to help users to troubleshoot any issues while performing their tasks in Identity Manager. Some of the tasks that Helpdesk can perform are:

* Reassign an approval request that is unattended for a long time
* Browse all tasks or filter tasks for a selected user
* Request permissions on behalf of other users

Users can contact Helpdesk by using the Helpdesk email ID, contact number, or raise a Helpdesk ticket. After setting up a Helpdesk, the administrator can customize the Helpdesk information for your clients from the Dashboard client settings.

For more information, see the following links:

* [Understanding a Client Helpdesk](../../identity_apps_admin/data/providing-permissions-to-users-identity-manager-47.html#understanding-client-helpdesk) in the [NetIQ Identity Manager - Administratorâs Guide to the Identity Applications](../../identity_apps_admin/data/bookinfo.html#bookinfo)
* [Using Helpdesk](../../identity_apps_admin/data/netiq-change-identity-applications-cliet-settings.html#t45h4sinegh4) in the [NetIQ Identity Manager - Administratorâs Guide to the Identity Applications](../../identity_apps_admin/data/bookinfo.html#bookinfo)

##### Support for Resource Expiration

This release allows you to set the expiration time period for the identity applications resources. This time period decides when access to a particular resource should expire from the date of assigning the resource. Additionally, users can request a resource for a specific time period. For more information, see the [NetIQ Identity Manager - Administratorâs Guide to the Identity Applications](../../identity_apps_admin/data/bookinfo.html#bookinfo).

##### Support for Delegation

This feature allows you to delegate your tasks to other users based on delegation configuration. You can configure delegation through the Dashboard in the identity applications.

For more information, see [Creating and Managing Delegations](../../identity_apps_admin/data/netiq-identity-manager-delegations.html#netiq-identity-manager-delegations) in the [NetIQ Identity Manager - Administratorâs Guide to the Identity Applications](../../identity_apps_admin/data/bookinfo.html#bookinfo) and [Managing Delegations](../../identity_apps_user/data/identity-manager-dashboard-delegation.html#identity-manager-dashboard-delegation) in the [NetIQ Identity Manager - Userâs Guide to the Identity Applications](../../identity_apps_user/data/netiq-identity-manager-user-guide.html#netiq-identity-manager-user-guide).

##### Revoke on Behalf

This release extends support for administrators and team managers to revoke a permission on behalf of someone else. It is also possible to revoke multiple permissions at one time.

For more information, see [Revoking Permissions](../../identity_apps_user/data/revoke-roles-resources-identity-manager-dashboard.html#revoke-roles-resources-identity-manager-dashboard) in the [NetIQ Identity Manager - Userâs Guide to the Identity Applications](../../identity_apps_user/data/netiq-identity-manager-user-guide.html#netiq-identity-manager-user-guide).

##### Support for Customizing the Dashboard

This release allows you to customize the widgets on your dashboard. Administrators can set preferences for the client users to add or remove widgets on their dashboards. For more information, see [Customizing the Identity Applications for Your Enterprise](../../identity_apps_admin/data/netiq-identity-manager-customize-identity-applications-for-your-enterprise.html#netiq-identity-manager-customize-identity-applications-for-your-enterprise) in the [NetIQ Identity Manager - Administratorâs Guide to the Identity Applications](../../identity_apps_admin/data/bookinfo.html#bookinfo).

##### Modernized Roles and Resource Management

This release integrates role and resource administration capabilities with the dashboard. This functionality was previously provided by Catalog Administrator. The new interface provides richer user interface experience for role and resource management. It also provides capability to assign or revoke roles and resources. For more information, see [Creating and Managing Roles](../../identity_apps_admin/data/netiq-create-manage-roles-identity-manager.html#netiq-create-manage-roles-identity-manager) and [Creating and Managing Resources](../../identity_apps_admin/data/chapter4.html#chapter4) in the [NetIQ Identity Manager - Administratorâs Guide to the Identity Applications](../../identity_apps_admin/data/bookinfo.html#bookinfo).

##### Roles and Resource Service Driver Performance Improvements

The Roles and Resource Service driver has been enhanced to include multiple threads to handle different tasks such as role and resource assignments, targeted to significantly improve the driver performance. For more information, see [Multi-Threaded Role and Resource Service Driver](../../identity_apps_admin/data/identity-manager-multi-threaded-role-and-resource-service-driver.html#identity-manager-multi-threaded-role-and-resource-service-driver) in the [NetIQ Identity Manager - Administratorâs Guide to the Identity Applications](../../identity_apps_admin/data/bookinfo.html#bookinfo).

##### Purging Resource History in Role and Resource Service Driver

By default, the driver is configured to purge the resource history on a daily basis. The driver only purges data from the resource history that is older than the retention value (in days) specified for the Store resource history for days setting. Any historical data that is more recent than the specified retention value is retained.

##### Support for Return and Reassign Tasks

Now different users can reassign and return the reassigned tasks through the Identity Manager Dashboard. Identity Manager personas such as Team Manager, Administrators, Helpdesk, and End Users have different capabilities to reassign and return tasks. For more information, see [Managing Requests for Approval or Denial](../../identity_apps_user/data/approve-deny-comment-task-request.html#approve-deny-comment-task-request) in the [NetIQ Identity Manager - Userâs Guide to the Identity Applications](../../identity_apps_user/data/netiq-identity-manager-user-guide.html#netiq-identity-manager-user-guide).

##### Proxied Authorization Control for User Application

Proxied Authorization Control for User Application provides a mechanism for specifying an authorization identity on a per-operation basis, benefiting administrators who need to perform operations efficiently on behalf of other users. This eliminates User Applicationâs need for SAML certificates while performing any operations on the Identity Vault.

#### Simplified Packaging of Installation Files

This version provides simplified packaging of Identity Manager components in a single ISO, each for Linux and Windows operating systems. Designer and Analyzer are also provided in separate files. Sentinel for IGA is provided in a separate file for ease of configuration with Identity Reporting.

### 1.5 Whatâs Changed, Deprecated, or Discontinued?

To streamline functionality, several items have changed or are no longer supported with Identity Manager 4.7. In many cases, alternative functionality replaces the items that are no longer supported.

#### Whatâs Deprecated for Removal?

This release deprecates the following features of the User Application:

*WARNING:*Identity Manager 4.7.1 will provide a new user interface for administering these features in place of the existing User Application interface. You must use the new user interface because User Application interface will be discontinued from this release. This is a step towards making the user interface consistent for all Identity Applications functionality.

Identity Self-Service, Work Dashboard, Compliance, Roles and Resources Administration

This version of Identity Manager introduces Identity Applications Administration interface. Instead of using these features in the User Application, you must use the new interface. These features of the User Application are not supported from this release. For more information, see the [NetIQ Identity Manager - Administratorâs Guide to the Identity Applications](../../identity_apps_admin/data/bookinfo.html#bookinfo).

Portal Pages and Portlets

This release does not support the portal functionality in the User Application. For more information about configuring the identity applications, see the [NetIQ Identity Manager - Administratorâs Guide to the Identity Applications](../../identity_apps_admin/data/bookinfo.html#bookinfo).

Guest and Single Sign-On Access

This release no longer supports the guest access and guest shared pages for the identity applications.

Starting Identity Manager 4.5, the method used for providing single sign-on access to the identity applications has changed. If you previously used SAP Logon Ticket, Kerberos, or Custom SSO Provider, NetIQ recommends that you familiarize yourself with the new OSP OAuth process.

For more information, see [NetIQ Identity Manager Setup Guide for Linux](../../setup_linux/data/front.html#front) or [NetIQ Identity Manager Setup Guide for Windows](../../setup_windows/data/front.html#front).

Attestation

The attestation feature of the User Application is not supported from this release.

Legacy Password Management

The Legacy Password Self-Service feature of the User Application is not supported from this release. Instead, use Self Service Password Reset (SSPR). The installation process enables SSPR by default when you install or upgrade to the latest version of Identity Manager. For more information, see [NetIQ Identity Manager Setup Guide for Linux](../../setup_linux/data/front.html#front) or [NetIQ Identity Manager Setup Guide for Windows](../../setup_windows/data/front.html#front).

#### Whatâs Discontinued?

The following list includes the features that have been discontinued from this release:

Integrated Installation Program

Identity Manager 4.7 does not include support for integrated installation program. This installer is discontinued from this release.

XDAS Auditing for Identity Applications

Auditing with XDAS for the identity applications components is discontinued from this release. You must use CEF for logging identity applications events.

This change is not applicable to other Identity Manager components that support XDAS. NetIQ recommends to use CEF auditing for all Identity Manager components.

Separate Access to Identity Manager Home and Provisioning Dashboard, and Catalog Administrator

This release provides an enhanced version of Identity Manager Dashboard that replaces Home and Provisioning Dashboard. Identity Manager Home and Provisioning Dashboard is discontinued from this release.

The functionality provided by Catalog Administrator is included in the Identity Applications Administration interface. Catalog Administrator is discontinued from this release.

REST Interface Service (RIS)

This version of Identity Manager provides access to a majority of identity applications functionality through Application Programming Interface (API). The API is HTTP based, with a RESTful programming interface. You can invoke the API by using a REST client or by using curl command in scripts to help automate the administrative tasks. RIS is discontinued from this release.

* Authentication by user
* Authentication by server
* Database statistics
* Self-password changes
* Password resets
* Identity Vault Driver Associations Report Current State
* Identity Vault User Report Current State
* User Password Change Events Summary

  For more information, see [Administrator Guide to NetIQ Identity Reporting](../../report_setup/data/bookinfo.html#bookinfo).

  *IMPORTANT:*To use the reports, import the report definitions into Identity Reporting. Log in to the Reporting application and use the Download page within the application to download the reports.

## 6.0 Working with MapDB 3.0.5

Identity Manager 4.7 adds support for MapDB 3.0.5. In addition to Identity Manager Engine, MapDB is used by the following Identity Manager drivers:

* Data Collection Services
* JDBC
* LDAP
* Managed System Gateway
* Office 365 and Azure Active Directory
* Salesforce

If you are using any of these drivers, you must review the following sections before upgrading the driver:

* [Understanding Identity Manager 4.7 Engine Support for Driver Versions](#t45xdplm7bes)
* [Manually Removing the MapDB Cache Files](#removing-mapdb-cache-files-identity-manager-47)

### 6.1 Understanding Identity Manager 4.7 Engine Support for Driver Versions

Review the following considerations before upgrading an Identity Manager driver that uses MapDB:

* Drivers shipped with Identity Manager 4.7 are compatible with Identity Manager 4.7 Engine or Remote Loader. You must perform the following actions to complete the driver upgrade:

  1. Upgrade the Identity Manager Engine.
  2. (Conditional) Upgrade the Remote Loader.
  3. Upgrade the driver.
  4. Manually remove the MapDB state cache files from the Identity Vaultâs DIB directory. For more information, see [Manually Removing the MapDB Cache Files](#removing-mapdb-cache-files-identity-manager-47).
* Drivers shipped before Identity Manager 4.7 are not compatible with Identity Manager 4.7 Engine or Remote Loader.
* Drivers shipped with Identity Manager 4.7 are not backward compatible with Identity Manager 4.6.x Engine or Remote Loader.
* Drivers shipped with Identity Manager 4.7 are not backward compatible with Identity Manager 4.5.x Engine or Remote Loader.

### 6.2 Manually Removing the MapDB Cache Files

The Identity Manager Engine upgrade process leaves some of the existing MapDB state cache files (dx\*) in the Identity Vaultâs DIB directory (/var/opt/novell/eDirectory/data/dib or C:\Novell\NDS\). You must manually remove these files for your driver after upgrading the driver. This action ensures that your driver works correctly with Identity Manager 4.7 engine.

The following table lists the MapDB state cache files that must be removed:

| Identity Manager Driver | MapDB State Cache File To Remove |
| Data Collection Services | DCSDriver\_<driver instance guid>-\*  <driver instance guid>-\* |
| JDBC | jdbc\_<driver instance guid>\_\* |
| LDAP | ldap\_<driver instance guid>\* |
| Managed System Gateway | MSGW-<driver-instance-guid>.\* |
| Office 365 and Azure Active Directory | <Azure driver name>\_obj.db.\* |
| Salesforce | <Salesforce driver name>.\*  <Salesforce driver name> |

where \* represents the name of the MapDB state cache file for a driver. In case of Salesforce driver, the MapDB state cache files are also represented by the driver name. Below are some examples of these files.

* DCSDriver\_<driver instance guid>-0.t, <driver instance guid>-1.p
* jdbc\_<driver instance guid>\_0.t, jdbc\_<driver instance guid>\_1
* ldap\_<driver instance guid>b, ldap\_<driver instance guid>b.p
* MSGW-<driver instance guid>.p, MSGW-<driver instance guid>.t
* <Azure driver name>\_obj.db.t, <Azure driver name>\_obj.db.p
* <Salesforce driver name>.p, <Salesforce driver name>.t, Salesforce driver1

#### Exception Caused by Missing Reporting Database Startup Key After Configuration on Linux

*Issue:*
If you are installing Identity Reporting on the same server that has Identity Applications installed, and you choose the database creation option as Startup during the Identity Reporting installation, the configuration script reports some exceptions in the log. (Bug 1082959)

*Workaround:*
Clear the exceptions by manually restarting Tomcat.This does not cause any impact on the installation. It is safe to ignore the exception.

#### User Application Driver Fails to Deploy When the Driver Set Context Contains an Organizational Unit on Linux

*Issue:*
If Identity Manager engine is installed and configured with a custom driver set and the driver setâs deploy context contains at least one Organizational Unit, the User Application driver fails to completely deploy to the Identity Vault. For example, the driver partially deploys if the deploy context is ou=drivers,o=novell. (Bug 1104606)

Below is a snippet of the error message logged to the idmconfigure.log file:

```
Couldn't write all values for nrfRequestDef. The object with DN cn=Attestation Report,cn=RequestDefs,cn=AppConfig,cn=User Application Driver,cn=appsdriverset,cn=driversets,o=novell doesn't exist in the directory.
Failure deploying cn=SoD Violation-Default,cn=Attestations,cn=RoleConfig,cn=AppConfig,cn=User Application Driver,cn=appsdriverset,ou=driversets,o=novell.
Deployment of cn=SoD Violation-Default,cn=Attestations,cn=RoleConfig,cn=AppConfig,cn=User Application Driver,cn=appsdriverset,ou=driversets,o=novell failed.
```

*Workaround:*
Perform the following actions:

1. Delete User Application and Role and Resource Service drivers that are automatically deployed by the installer.
2. Manually deploy User Application and Role and Resource Service drivers.
3. Verify that the User Application driverâs dn is valid by using the configupdate utility.

#### Datasource Not Added to the Reporting Application Page When Database Schema Is Created During Identity Reporting Installation with Oracle Database on Windows

*Issue:*
After installing and configuring Identity Reporting, when you log in to the reporting application, the datasource is not available in the application. (Bug 1082990)

The following error is logged to the catalina.out file:

```
com.netiq.persist.PersistenceException: javax.naming.NameNotFoundException: Name [IDMDCSDataSource] is not bound in this Context. Unable to find [IDMDCSDataSource].
```

*Workaround:*
After completing the Identity Reporting configuration, manually add the datasource to the reporting application.

1. Log in to Identity Reporting.
2. Click Data Sources > Add.
3. In Add Data Source, click Select from predefined list.
4. Select IDMDCSDataSource and name it IDMDCSDataSource.

   The Save button is activated only when a name is specified.
5. Click Save.

#### Cannot Specify Installation Paths on Windows that Include Spaces

The installation programs for Identity Manager components might not place the installation files in the specified location if the path contains spaces. Ensure that the specified path does not contain any spaces. (Bug 620797)

#### Cannot Restart Tomcat with Task Manager on Windows

*Issue:*
You cannot use the Task Manager to restart Tomcat on a Windows server. (Bug 893155)

*Workaround:*
Use one of the following methods to restart Tomcat:

* In the Services control panel, right-click IDM Apps Tomcat Service then click Restart.
* Use the command prompt to stop and then start Tomcat:

  ```
  net stop "IDM Apps Tomcat Service"
  net start "IDM Apps Tomcat Service"
  ```

  or

  ```
  sc stop "IDM Apps Tomcat Service"
  sc start "IDM Apps Tomcat Service"
  ```

#### LDAP Server Displays an Error While using VLV and SSS Controls

*Issue:*
When you configure an LDAP search to use VLV (Virtual List View) and SSS (Server Side Sort) controls and the LDAP server does not hold a local copy of the user objects, the search fails with an error.

*Workaround:*
Store the user objects into your local replica to use VLV and SSS controls. For more information see the TID [7001493](https://www.novell.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=7001493).

#### Tables are Not Created if ConfigUpdate Utility is Launched Right After Installing Identity Applications

*Issue:*
While installing the identity applications, if you select the option for creating tables at startup and do not start the application, but rather launch configupdate and click OK, the com.netiq.idm.create-db-on-startup setting is set to false. Because you have not actually started the application, the tables are not created. This issue causes the startup to fail because the tables do not exist. (Bug 900284)

*Workaround:*
Open ism-configuration.properties, change the value from false to true, save the file, and then restart the application.

#### Some Installation Wizards Display an Incorrect Icon for Components

*Issue:*
The Tomcat and PostgreSQL convenience installer displays a Java icon instead of displaying an icon for Tomcat and PostgreSQL components. This issue is also observed in One SSO Provider (OSP).

*Workaround:*
There is no workaround at this time.

#### Navigation Panel is Truncated in Identity Reporting Installer on Windows

*Issue:*
In some languages, the navigation panel that appears on the left side of the installation program for Identity Reporting appears truncated. You might not be able to see all of the Navigation panel names. (Bug 899888)

*Workaround:*
You can safely ignore the truncated navigation panel and continue with the installation.

#### Designer Fails to Authenticate With Identity Manager Server on Windows When the Connection Uses Proxy Configuration

*Issue:*
When Designer is configured to use a proxy server to access the Identity Manager server, Designer fails to authenticate with the Identity Manager server.

*Workaround:*
Perform the following actions:

1. Click Window > Preferences General > Network Connections.
2. Change the Active Provider setting from Direct to Manual.
3. Select HTTP or HTTPS protocol under the Proxy entries section. Do not select SOCKS protocol.
4. In the Edit Proxy Entry window, provide the IP address of the Identity Vault for your connection (HTTP or HTTPS), then click OK.
5. Click Add Host under the Proxy bypass section.
6. In the Proxy bypass hosts window that opens, provide the IP address of the Identity Vault, then click OK.

#### Filter Resource Changes Are Not Automatically Applied to the Package

*Issue:*
If a driver contains a package that includes a filter resource, any changes made to the filter resource are not reflected in the driver filter. For example, when a new class or an attribute is added to the filter, the changes are not merged with the driver filter.

*Workaround:*
Manually synchronize the changes with the package.

1. In the Outline view, right-click the filter resource and select Sync to Package.
2. Select the package where you want to add the filter resource and click OK.

#### Drivers Do Not Start When Identity Manager Engine Is Installed as a Non-root User

*Issue:*
This issue occurs because the Java files are not installed during the installation process.

*Workaround:*
Perform the steps from TID [7023354](https://www.netiq.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=7023354).

#### Cannot Configure Multiple Instances of Identity Vault on Linux

*Issue:*
The Identity Manager Linux installer does not support configuring multiple instances of Identity Vault.

*Workaround:*
Perform the following actions:

1. Manually configure an additional instance of Identity Vault on which you want to install Identity Manager by using the ndsconfig utility.

   You can configure multiple instances of the Identity Vault on a single host. The method to configure multiple instances with the ndsconfig utility is similar to configuring a single instance multiple times. Each instance must have unique instance identifiers, such as the following:

   * Different data and log file locations. Use the --config-file, -d, and -D options.
   * A unique port number for the instance. Use the -b and -B options.
   * A unique server name for the instance. Use the -S server name option.
2. Verify that all Identity Vault instances are stopped. To stop an Identity Vault instance, run ndsmanage stopall.
3. Navigate to /etc/opt/novell/eDirectory/conf/.edir/ and take a backup of the instances.0 file.
4. Edit the instances.0 file to keep only the Identity Vault instance entry on which you want to install Identity Manager.
5. Create an empty file named IDM in /etc/opt/netiq/idm/configure/.

   ```
   #cd /etc/opt/netiq/idm/configure/
   ```
   ```
   # touch IDM
   ```
6. Run the configure.sh script.
7. Restore the instances.0 file to /etc/opt/novell/eDirectory/conf/.edir/ that you backed up in Step 2.
8. Restart the additional Identity Vault instances.

### 7.2 Identity Manager Engine Issues

* [Unable to Execute Large ECMAScripts](#t45idhvu9wta)
* [Adding Multiple Entitlement Values to a Static Resource Fails](#t45mxabufor7)

#### Unable to Execute Large ECMAScripts

*Issue:*
This issue is caused by Rhino engine's inability to parse very large scripts.(Bugs 1016963, 942241)

*Workaround:*
Identity Manager 4.6 supports Nashorn ECMAScript engine. Use this scripting engine for executing large ECMAScripts. For more information, see [Engine Control Values](../../driver_admin/data/b94psjw.html#b94psjw) in the [NetIQ Identity Manager Driver Administration Guide](../../driver_admin/data/bktitle.html#bktitle).

For information about moving to Nashorn scripting engine, see the [Rhino Migration Guide](https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/Nashorn/Rhino%2BMigration%2BGuide).

#### Adding Multiple Entitlement Values to a Static Resource Fails

*Issue:*
When you create a static resource with multiple entitlement values by using do-create-resource token, Identity Manager engine creates only one nrfEntitlementRef object for the resource. Therefore, you cannot create static resources with multiple assignment values by using this token. (Bug 995486)

*Workaround:*
There is no workaround at this time.

### 7.3 Remote Loader Issues

* [Cannot Generate Novell Audit Events for 32-Bit and 64-Bit Remote Loaders on the Same Server](#t45idhvuazeb)
* [Key Password Specified at the Remote Loader Side is Not Validated Using Mutual Authentication](#t45f13sldtql)
* [.NET Remote Loader Driver Instance Configured for Mutual Authentication Does Not Start](#t45n1dz2wys3)

#### Cannot Generate Novell Audit Events for 32-Bit and 64-Bit Remote Loaders on the Same Server

*Issue:*
Although you can install both a 32-bit and a 64-bit Remote Loader on the same computer, the lcache files for these versions cannot work concurrently. The Novell Audit events are logged to the lcache file for the version that you installed first. The log file for the other version displays the message: Agent already running error. (Bug 676310)

*Workaround:*
Do not install both versions on the same computer.

#### Key Password Specified at the Remote Loader Side is Not Validated Using Mutual Authentication

*Issue:*
The dxcmd tool generates the PEM file for a private key without an encryption password. Therefore, Identity Manager establishes the connection between remote loader and engine without validating the encryption password (key password). (Bug 1077147)

*Workaround:*
You must create a client KMO using iManager with a encrypted password. Generate keyfile.pem from this KMO and replace the existing keyfile.pem using following steps:

1. Log in to iManager.
2. Create a KMO for a client authentication in .pfx format:

   1. Go to Roles and Tasks > NetIQ Certificate Access > Server Certificates.
   2. Click New, specify the Nickname for your certificate.
   3. Select Custom as creation method and click Next.

      This option allows you to define certificate parameters.
   4. Select Organizational certificate authority and click Next.
   5. In Enable extended key usage, select User and click Next.
   6. Select the Validity Period from the list and click Next.
   7. Select Your organizationâs certificate and click Next.
   8. Click Finish.
3. Select the newly created certificate and click Validate.
4. Select the client KMO and click Export.

   *NOTE:*In iManager, KMO is exported in .pfx format.
5. Convert the exported client KMO from .pfx to .pem format using the following command:

   ```
   openssl pkcs12 -in <exported_certificate_name>.pfx -out <converted_certificate_name>.pem
   ```

   For example,

   ```
   openssl pkcs12 -in cert.pfx -out client_cert.pem
   ```
6. Replace keyfile.pem with client\_cert.pem

#### .NET Remote Loader Driver Instance Configured for Mutual Authentication Does Not Start

*Issue:*
After upgrading 32-bit or 64-bit .NET Remote Loader, a driver configured with mutual authentication enabled fails to start the .NET Remote Loader instance. (Bug 1082989)

*Workaround:*
After upgrading .NET Remote Loader, perform the following steps:

1. Edit the .NET Remote Loader instance, specify the same key password that is set prior to upgrading the .NET Remote Loader.

   The default key password is dirxml.
2. Save the configuration.
3. Start the .NET Remote Loader driver instance.

### 7.4 Driver Issues

You might encounter the following issues as you use the Identity Manager drivers:

* [ClassNotFoundException Reported When tmp Directory is Full](#t4603c7si0g1)
* [Statistics Report Shows Zero for Role and License Values for an Office 365 Driver](#t45idhvuc9p5)
* [Remote Loader Instance of a Driver Might Fail to Start If the Default Width of Windows Command Prompt Window is Changed](#t45idhvuchey)
* [dxcmd Query with Huge Output is Executed Twice](#t45idhvucp4r)
* [Issue with Adding DirXML Accounts Entry When a User is Migrated](#t45idhvucwuk)
* [Driver Cache Inspector is Unable to Display the Last Entry in the Cache List](#t45idhvud4kd)
* [Remedy Driver Does Not Start When Run Locally with the Identity Manager Engine](#t45idhvudrps)

#### ClassNotFoundException Reported When tmp Directory is Full

*Issue:*
Sometimes a driver fails to start and reports a java.lang.ClassNotFoundException exception although the driver shim is present in the classes directory. This can occur if the temporary directory used by the Java environment has no free space. In most cases, the location of the temporary directory is /tmp. (Bug 683259)

*Workaround:*
Provide sufficient space in the temporary directory.

#### Statistics Report Shows Zero for Role and License Values for an Office 365 Driver

*Issue:*
The Statistics report for the Office 365 driver shows zero for Role and License values in the Assigned Entitlements Per Type section because of a limitation in the Office 365 driver. (Bug 893248)

*Workaround:*
There is no workaround at this time.

#### Remote Loader Instance of a Driver Might Fail to Start If the Default Width of Windows Command Prompt Window is Changed

*Issue:*
If you change the width of the Windows command prompt window from the default value, the driver instance might fail to start and it does not record any trace information. (Bug 854488)

*Workaround:*
Reset the width of the Windows command prompt window to the default value of 80.

#### dxcmd Query with Huge Output is Executed Twice

*Issue:*
When you issue a dxcmd command to a driver for processing a query, by default the Identity Manager engine waits 120 seconds for a response from the driver. If there is no response, the engine retries the query after the timeout. If there is no response after another 120 seconds, the engine displays ERR\_TRANSPORT\_FAILURE error. This results in the driverâs processing the query twice. (Bug 1014581)

*Workaround:*
Set the environment variable NCPCLIENT\_REQ\_TIMEOUT to a value greater than the time expected to execute the query.

#### Issue with Adding DirXML Accounts Entry When a User is Migrated

*Issue:*
When a user is migrated from the Identity Vault with a driver without entitlements packages, Identity Manager does not populate a value for the DirXML-Accounts attribute for the user. This issue occurs when the information for the user is same in both connected application and the Identity Vault. (Bug 1016682)

*Workaround:*
There is no workaround at this time.

#### Driver Cache Inspector is Unable to Display the Last Entry in the Cache List

*Issue:*
On web browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge, the Driver Cache Inspector does not display the last entry in the driver cache list.

*Workaround:*
Perform the following actions:

1. Expand all the cache entries in the list by selecting Actions > Expand All from the main menu.
2. Use the keyboard arrow keys to navigate to any expanded entry from the list.

#### Remedy Driver Does Not Start When Run Locally with the Identity Manager Engine

*Issue:*
When the driver is configured to run locally with the Identity Manager engine, the driver fails to start due to a conflicting JAXB API included in the activemq-all-5.15.2.jar file and reports the following error message in the trace:

```
com.sun.xml.internal.ws.spi.db.DatabindingException: Unknown JAXBContext implementation: class com.sun.xml.bind.v2.runtime.JAXBContextImpl
```

*Workaround:*
Perform the following actions:

1. Install the driver with the Remote Loader.
2. Remove the activemq-all-5.15.2.jar file from the lib folder of the Remote Loader installation directory.
3. Start the driver.

### 7.5 Identity Applications Issues

You might encounter the following issues when you use the identity applications, which includes Dashboard, Identity Applications Administration interface, and the User Application:

* [Error Reported if Different Databases Are Configured for Identity Applications and Identity Reporting Installed on the Same Server](#t45idhvueev7)
* [Zero File Size Shown for Archived Logs From catalina.out File Despite Log RollOver](#t43k7nlea0b5)

* [Role and Resource Service Driver Does Not Support Recalculation of Roles, Resources, and DirXML-EntitlementRef Attribute for a User](#t46dm3z3630l)
* [catalina.out File Does Not Rotate the Log](#t46hkdj09m2y)

#### Error Reported if Different Databases Are Configured for Identity Applications and Identity Reporting Installed on the Same Server

*Issue:*
Identity Manager does not support using different databases for the identity applications and Identity Reporting components installed on the same server. For example, you cannot use a PostgreSQL database installed on the same server for the identity applications and point Identity Reporting to a remote Oracle database. This causes exceptions in the catalina\_<date>.log file. (Bug 1079738)

*Workaround:*
To use different databases for the identity applications and Identity Reporting, install the components on separate servers.

#### Zero File Size Shown for Archived Logs From catalina.out File Despite Log RollOver

*Issue:*
The archived file size shows zero file size. (Bug 1044488)

*Workaround:*
Perform the following actions:

1. Stop the Tomcat service. For example, run the following command from a command prompt:

   ```
   systemctl stop netiq-tomcat.service
   ```
2. Navigate to the Tomcat/conf directory. For example, /opt/netiq/idm/apps/tomcat/conf.
3. Modify the userapp-log4j.xml file in a text editor.

   1. Add the following entries for log appenders after the Catalina Appender section.

      ```
      <!-- catalina.out logrollover -->
          <appender name="CATALINALOG"  class="org.apache.log4j.DailyRollingFileAppender">
              <param name="Append" value="true"/>
              <param name="DatePattern" value="'.'yyyy-MM-dd'.log'"/>
              <param name="Encoding" value="UTF-8"/>
              <param name="File" value="${catalina.base}/logs/catalina.out"/>
              <param name="Threshold" value="ALL"/>
              <layout class="org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout">
                  <param name="ConversionPattern" value="%d [%p] %c{1} %m%n"/>
              </layout>
          </appender>
      ```
   2. Add <appender-ref ref="CATALINALOG"/> entry under the <root> section before </log4j:configuration> section.

      The section should look similar to this:

      ```
      <!-- ======================= -->
          <!-- Setup the Root category -->

#### Revoke Permissions Page Incorrectly Lists Others Permissions for Role Administrator and Delegated Role Administrator

*Issue:*
If you log in to the Dashboard as a Role Administrator or a Delegated Role Administrator, the Others page (Access > Permissions > Revoke Permissions > Others) lists the user permissions that are outside of your domain or scope.

* For a Role Administrator, the Dashboard lists resources of users that are not part of the administrator's domain.
* For a Delegated Role Administrator, the Dashboard lists all resources and roles of users that are not delegated. (Bug 1079043)

*Workaround:*
There is no workaround at this time.

#### Dashboard Displays Erroneous Count of Total Users

*Issue:*
The following issues are reported:

* When you add users and immediately refresh the view, the Dashboard lists the new users but does not update the count of total users. However, the updated total count of users is correctly displayed if you refresh the view after a few seconds.
* If a user has multiple values for either the given name or sn, the Dashboard shows different values for Search Count and Total Count. (Bug 1006448)

*Workaround:*
There is no workaround at this time.

#### Pop-up Windows Might Display Contents in a Mix of Browser and Client Default Languages

*Issue:*
When you perform an action that opens a pop-up window, the Dashboard might display a section of the window contents in the clientâs language instead of the browserâs language. For example, viewing the details for a task opens a pop-up window. This issue occurs in Microsoft Internet Explorer or Edge browsers after the user changes the browserâs language to one that is not the clientâs default language. (Bug 1019020)

*Workaround:*
After changing the browserâs language, close the current tab. Then open a new tab to log in to the Dashboard.

#### Request and Approval Workflow Forms Have Right-Aligned Field Labels

*Issue:*
When accessing Request and Approval forms in the Dashboard, form field labels are right-aligned. (Bug 921403)

*Workaround:*
To make the form field labels on Request and Approval workflows align from the left, add the following statement to each form's onload event:

```
$("div.nv-formFieldLabel").parent().css("text-align", "left");
```

#### CLE Restricted Browser Blocks Access to the Forgotten Password Page

*Issue:*
When you restrict access to websites but whitelist the Landing page for the identity applications, CLE Restricted Browser might block access to the Forgotten Password page for Self Service Password Reset. Users might see the following error:

```
"Access is restricted to your Target Server"
```

(Bug 1021647)

*Workaround:*
In the whitelist, add the URL to the Forgotten Password page.

Also, if you upgrade from Identity Manager 4.5, update the link to Landing to direct users to the new Dashboard (/idmdash/#/landing) instead of Identity Manager Home (/landing) in the SSPR redirect URL section.

#### Can Approve or Deny a Role Request after the Role has been Deleted

*Issue:*
If an administrator deletes a role that requires a workflow after a user has made a role request, the workflow addressee for the role request still sees the workflow in the Task List and is able to approve or deny the request. (Bug 752860)

*Workaround:*
There is no workaround at this time.

#### Creating and Copying the Base Package for the User Application Drivers causes Roles Based Provisioning Module to Fail

*Issue:*
When you perform certain operations on the User Application base package that you created, such as removing the role configuration object, it causes RBPM to fail. (Bug 879595)

*Workaround:*
NetIQ recommends that you do not create or copy the User Application driver base package.

#### Cannot Start a Password for a User Application Account with the < Character

*Issue:*
You cannot use the special character â<â as the first character in a password for the User Application. For example, <testing12. The browser interprets the password as badly formatted HTML text, and the user cannot log in. (Bug 759297)

*Workaround:*
There is no workaround at this time.

#### Workflows Report an Error when Using dateToString for Timestamp Control

*Issue:*
Workflows that you created in the User Application and that use the form script method dateToString for a timestamp do not function appropriately in Identity Manager Home. The dateToString form script in the API includes seconds, while the new Date/Time control in Identity Manager Home does not. The new script uses a different format. To ensure that your forms function with Identity Manager Home, you must replace dateToString with the new script: new Date ().toString ('Date.CultureInfo.formatPatterns.shortDate+" "+Date.CultureInfo.formatPatterns.shortTime').

*Workaround:*
To replace the control for a single date in your form, you might use the following code:

```
document.getElementById('%Field-Name').value = new Date().toString('Date.CultureInfo.formatPatterns.shortDate+" "+Date.CultureInfo.formatPatterns.shortTime');
```

However, you might need to replace controls that represent two dates. For example, you might have a form requiring that the user specify a start and end time for an entitlement request.

To specify startDate, use the following type of code:

```
document.getElementById('_startDate').value = new Date().toString('Date.CultureInfo.formatPatterns.shortDate+" "+Date.CultureInfo.formatPatterns.shortTime');
```

To specify an endDate that occurs three days after the starting date, use the following type of code:

```
var s = new Date().getTime();
  s = s + 3 * 1000 * 24 * 60 * 60;
  document.getElementById('_furDate').value = new Date(s).toString('Date.CultureInfo.formatPatterns.shortDate+" "+Date.CultureInfo.formatPatterns.shortTime');
```

In this example, the workflow responds with the following information:

```
startDate: 3/14/2014 12:03 PM
endDate: 3/17/2014 12:03 PM
```

*NOTE:*In the above codes, if you want to use only DatePicker in your form you can exclude 'Date.CultureInfo.formatPatterns.shortTime' from the code.

For example, if you want to specify only date for startDate, you can use following type of code:

document.getElementById('\_startDate').value = new Date().toString('Date.CultureInfo.formatPatterns.shortDate');

#### User Application Navigation Items are Not Displayed When Using Safari on an iPad

*Issue:*
If you are running the User Application using Safari on an iPad that is in portrait orientation, the header navigation items do not always display properly.

*Workaround:*
To display the header navigation item, select a navigation item on the left.

#### Customized CSS does not Synchronize with the Cluster Nodes

*Issue:*
In Identity Manager Dashboard, when you upload the customized CSS in the cluster, CSS changes are not applied on all the cluster nodes. (1025836)

*Workaround:*
Ensure that each node in the cluster has the same copy of CSS in the following location:

```
<user home directory>/netiq_custom_css
```

#### ClientAbortException While Logging Out of the User Applications on Windows

*Issue:*
If you try to list users either by selecting Identity Manager Dashboard > People > Users or by selecting Manage Users and then log out of the identity applications before Dashboard displays the total count of users in the browser, this process generates a ClientAbortException exception in the catalina.out file. This exception can also occur in the following cases while working with the identity applications:

* The browser window is closed.
* Network is disconnected.
* Session has timed-out.

*Workaround:*
There is no workaround at this time. It is safe to ignore this exception as it does not cause any functionality loss.

#### Unable to Change Password using Identity Manager Dashboard

*Issue:*
If you installed SSPR and identity applications on separate servers, and try to change the password on the Applications page, the identity applications display Page not found error. (Bug 1077395)

*Workaround:*
Specify the network IP address of the SSPR server in Change My Password in the Applications page.

1. Log in to your Identity Manager Dashboard as an administrator.

   https://<Identity Applications IP address:Port>/idmdash
2. Go to Applications, click ![](../graphics/cog1.png).
3. On Change My Password, click ![](../graphics/edit.png).
4. In Link, specify the SSPR server address.

   https://<SSPR-IP-address:port>//sspr/private/ChangePassword
5. Click Save.

#### Default Dashboard Widgets Fail to Load Widget Information on the Dashboard After Upgrade

*Issue:*
If you defined a different context name than IDMProv, the default dashboard widgets that use REST APIs fail to obtain the widget information from the identity applications. (Bug 1080591)

*Workaround:*
Change the context name for the widgets that are using REST APIs:

1. In Dashboard, click ![](../graphics/more.png) and select Widgets.
2. Click ![](../graphics/cog1.png) on a widget that you want to change the context name.
3. In URL, change /IDMProv to /<defined context name>.

   For example, in the following URL,

   ```
   /IDMProv/rest/access/assignments/advanced?nextIndex=1&sortBy=name&sortOrder=ASC&forceRefresh=true&searchScope=role&size=20
   ```

   change /IDMProv to /IDMProv\_new.

#### Dashboard Logout Button Might Not WorkÂ

*Issue:*
Sometimes identity applications do not take you to the Login page when you click the Logout button in the Dashboard. (Bug 1082178)

*Workaround:*
Perform one of the following actions:

1. Refresh the Dashboard page.
2. Navigate to a different application (for example, Role Administration or IDMProv) and log out from that application page.

#### Click Description Or Mapping Description of a Child Role to Select It For Deletion

*Issue:*
The new Identity Applications user interface displays the parent and child role list in the Role Details page. The page does not allow you to select a child role by selecting the name, instead it shows child role quick information. (Bug 1082533)

*Workaround:*
To delete a child role, click the description or mapping description of the child role. For deleting multiple child roles, use keyboardâs Ctrl key and click the description or mapping description of the selected roles.

#### Increased Length of the OSP Attribute Value Causes Login Issues

*Issue:*
If you do not log out after every successful login into the identity applications, the value of the OSP attribute gradually increases after multiple logins. The increased length of the value causes login issues.

*Workaround:*
Perform any one of the following actions:

Manually clear the value of the OSP attribute in iManager.

1. Log in to iManager.
2. In View Objects, select the user object.
3. In Other tab, double-click oidInstanceData attribute and clear the value.

Or,

Decrease the Refresh token lifetime value using the ConfigUpdate utility:

1. Launch the ConfigUpdate utility.
2. Select Authentication tab.
3. In Authentication Configuration, decrease the Refresh token lifetime (hours) value.

   By default, Refresh token lifetime (hours) is set to 48 hours.

#### Role and Resource Service Driver Does Not Support Recalculation of Roles, Resources, and DirXML-EntitlementRef Attribute for a User

*Issue:*
If you resynchronize a user in the Role and Resource Service driver, the driver checks the user attributes in the filter and synchronizes them, but it does not recalculate the roles and resources assigned to the user. (Bug 1093450)

*Workaround:*
There is no workaround at this time.

#### catalina.out File Does Not Rotate the Log

*Issue:*
If you installed Identity Applications on Linux or Windows, the catalina.out file does not rotate the log.

*Workaround on Linux:*
Perform the following actions:

1. Open a text editor and create a netiq-tomcat file at /etc/logrotate.d/ with the following entries:

   ```
   /opt/netiq/idm/apps/tomcat/logs/catalina.out {
           copytruncate
           daily
           dateext
           dateformat -%Y-%m-%d
           rotate 25
           notifempty
           missingok
           compress
          su novlua novlua
   }
   ```
2. Verify that logrotate is scheduled to run at midnight.
3. Verify that novlua user and novlua group permissions are set for the catalina.out file.
4. Verify that the log is correctly rotated.

   Run the following command:

   /usr/sbin/logrotate -d /etc/logrotate.d/netiq-tomcat

   You should see messages similar to the below in the screen.

   ```
   reading config file /etc/logrotate.d/netiq-tomcat
   Handling 1 logs
   rotating pattern: /opt/netiq/idm/apps/tomcat/logs/catalina.out  after 1 days (25 rotations)
   empty log files are not rotated, old logs are removed
   switching euid to 485 and egid to 0
   considering log /opt/netiq/idm/apps/tomcat/logs/catalina.out
   log does not need rotating
   switching euid to 0 and egid to 0
   ```

*Workaround on Windows:*
There is no workaround at this time.

### 7.6 Identity Reporting Issues

You might encounter the following issues when you use Identity Reporting:

* [Cannot Modify the Frequency of a Schedule](#t45idhvvfa1r)
* [Identity Reporting and Identity Data Collection Services Pages Are Unable to Launch Identity Applications](#t45j9dl9x71e)
* [Data Collection Page Help for Non-English Locales Redirects to English Help](#t45n9fuj8fpj)
* [Identity Manager Data Collection Services Page is Not Displayed in Standard Edition on Linux](#t45nkvfqs63b)
* [OSP Events Are Not Forwarded to the sentinel\_events Table When CEF Is Enabled](#t45wgcaxzi0y)
* [Identity Reporting Creates Tables With Incorrect Data Type When Startup Option Is Selected](#t4gdqp1lddng)

#### Cannot Modify the Frequency of a Schedule

*Issue:*
You cannot change the frequency of a schedule. For example, from week to month. (Bug 677430)

*Workaround:*
To change the frequency, delete the schedule and create a new one.

#### Identity Reporting and Identity Data Collection Services Pages Are Unable to Launch Identity Applications

*Issue:*
This issue occurs after upgrading Identity Manager to the latest version. When you click Home from Identity Reporting or Identity Data Collection Services user interface that are installed on separate servers than the identity applications, the identity applications are not launched. Instead, the Page Not Found error is displayed. (Bug 1080514)

*Workaround:*
To change the landing URL for Identity Reporting, manually update the configupdate utility with Identity Manager Dashboard URL:

1. Launch configupdate utility.

   By default, this utility is located in /opt/netiq/idm/apps/configupdate
2. Navigate to SSO clients > Reporting.
3. In URL link to landing page, specify the URL of the Identity Manager Dashboard.

   For example, https://<Identity Applications network IP address:Port>/idmdash/#/landing

   ![](../graphics/reporting_issues.png)

To change the landing URL for Identity Manager Data Collection Services:

1. Open the ism-configuration.properties in the text editor from /opt/netiq/idm/apps/tomcat/conf.
2. Append the landing URL to the following text:

   ```
   com.netiq.idmdcs.landing.url = https://<Identity Applications network IP address:Port>/idmdash/#/landing
   ```

   For example,

   ```
   com.netiq.idmdcs.landing.url = https://192.168.0.2:8443/idmdash/#/landing
   ```
3. Restart Tomcat.

You can ignore the issue if you are using Standard Edition that does not include identity applications. This issue does not cause any functionality loss for Standard Edition installations.

#### Data Collection Page Help for Non-English Locales Redirects to English Help

*Issue:*
When you install Data Collection Services in a non-English locale and click the Help icon from the Data Collection Services page, it takes you to the English version of the Help. (Bug 1082987)

*Workaround:*
There is no workaround at this time.

#### Identity Manager Data Collection Services Page is Not Displayed in Standard Edition on Linux

*Issue:*
After installing and configuring Identity Reporting in Standard Edition, the Identity Manager Data Collection Services page is not displayed. (Bug 1082564)

*Workaround:*
While configuring Identity Reporting, select No (N) for the following prompt:

Do you want to connect to an external One SSO Server (Y/N)?

#### OSP Events Are Not Forwarded to the sentinel\_events Table When CEF Is Enabled

*Issue:*
When CEF is enabled, the product name for OSP events is changed to MicroFocus One SSO Provider. The changed product name is not present in the data synchronization policy criteria. Therefore, OSP events are not forwarded to the sentinel\_events table after reaching SLM for IGA. (Bug 1087435)

*Workaround:*
Perform the following actions:

1. In SLM for IGA, click storage > data synchronization
2. Edit the policy created by idmdcs
3. In criteria, append pn:"MicroFocus One SSO Provider"
4. Click Save and resynchronize

#### Identity Reporting Creates Tables With Incorrect Data Type When Startup Option Is Selected

*Issue:*
When Identity Reporting is used with Oracle database and the Startup option is selected during the database schema creation, the database tables incorrectly create the varchar2 data type as nvarchar2. (Defect 288170)

*Workaround:*
There is no workaround at this time.

### 7.7 iManager Plug-In Issues

You might encounter the following issues as you use iManager:

* [Exception on Windows 2016 When Using KMO](#t45idhvvjkdd)
* [Dependency on NDS-to-NDS Driver Certificates Wizard](#t45idhvvlpj6)
* [Some Actions Are Not Available in Policy Builder Plug-In](#t45idhvvnuoz)

#### Exception on Windows 2016 When Using KMO

*Issue:*
When you export a CA certificate in a .b64 format from iManager, a blank line is added at the end of the certificate. This makes the certificate invalid. (Bug 1018732)

*Workaround:*
Manually remove the blank line from the certificate.

#### Dependency on NDS-to-NDS Driver Certificates Wizard

*Issue:*
iManager needs the NDS-to-NDS Driver Certificates Wizard for proper functioning.

*Workaround:*
To use the NDS-to-NDS Driver Certificates Wizard, download and install the iManager plug-in for NetIQ Certificate Server.

#### Some Actions Are Not Available in Policy Builder Plug-In

*Issue:*
This release does not support building the following actions by using Policy Builder in iManager.(Bug 1018354)

* Create role
* Create resource
* Add resource
* Remove resource
* Generate XDAS event

*Workaround:*
To build these actions, use Policy Builder in Designer.

### 7.8 Identity Manager Upgrade Issues

* [Existing Data Sync Policy Is Not Shown in the Data Collection Services Page after Upgrading from Identity Manager 4.6.x to 4.7](#t45idhvvua6e)
* [Upgrading Identity Manager Components in a Distributed Environment](#t45lr16p938s)
* [Progress Indicator Shows Truncated Directory Names for Some Components During Upgrade on Windows](#t45idhvw2utm)
* [Upgrade Process Fails due to Missing Port Values in the URL](#t45idhvw4zzf)
* [Identity Applications Upgrade Fails to Preserve Branding Settings in the Database](#t478ugqxt0ap)
* [Unable To Save the Configuration Update Utility After Upgrading Identity Reporting in Standard Edition](#t474kmu25jzu)
* [Upgrading Tomcat Results in Loss of SSL Certificates](#upgrading-tomcat-results-in-loss-of-ssl-certificates)
* [Upgrading PostgreSQL Using the Upgrade Script Defaults to Non-SSL Configuration](#upgrading-postgresql-using-the-upgrade-script-defaults-to-non-ssl-configuration)

#### Existing Data Sync Policy Is Not Shown in the Data Collection Services Page after Upgrading from Identity Manager 4.6.x to 4.7

*Issue:*
If you upgrade to Sentinel 8.1.1 and Identity Reporting 4.7, the new Data Collection Services page does not display the existing Data Sync policy. (Bug 1080081)

*Workaround:*
Complete the following steps after upgrading Sentinel:

1. Delete your Data Synchronization policy.

   * If you upgraded from Sentinel 8.0.1 or prior versions, delete the Data Synchronization policy from Sentinel and delete the sentinel\_events table from the reporting database. Log in to the PostgreSQL database and delete the sentinel\_events table under public schema. Updating Sentinel removes data from the sentinel\_events table. Log in to Sentinel > Storage > Data Synchronization, select your policy and click Delete. Log in to the reporting database and delete the sentinel\_events table under public schema.
   * If you upgraded from versions later than Sentinel 8.1, delete only the Data Synchronization policy. Log in to Sentinel > Storage > Data Synchronization, select your policy and click Delete.
2. Launch the Data Collection Services page and navigate to Settings > Data Sync > Data Sync Policies.
3. To add a new policy, click New Policy.
4. In the New Data Sync Policy page, specify the Sentinel and database server details.
5. Click Show Advanced to configure the payload for the policy you are creating.
6. Click Create.

#### Upgrading Identity Manager Components in a Distributed Environment

*Issue 1:*
If OSP and SSPR are installed on a separate server in your distributed environment.

The upgrade process replaces the non-default file, oauth-keystore.file (for example, idmnew.jks) with the default file name (osp.jks). (Bug 1081968)

*Workaround:*
Perform the following steps to replace the default file with the non-default file after completing the upgrade:

1. Launch the Configuration Update utility.
2. In Authentication tab, scroll to the Authentication Configuration section.
3. In OAuth keystore file, replace the path to the JKS keystore file with the non-default file (for example, idmnew.jks). This file is located in the back-up folder of OSP.
4. In OAuth keystore file password, specify the password to load the non-default OAuth keystore file.

*Issue 2:*
If Identity Manager is configured to authenticate with NetIQ Access Manager and you imported third-party certificates into Tomcatâs cacerts directory.

*Workaround:*
Reimport the third-party certificates into the idm.jks key-store. This is required because Tomcat of Identity Manager 4.7 uses idm.jks key-store. For example, if Identity Manager is configured to use Access Manager server for authentication, import the Access Manager certificate into idm.jks.

#### Progress Indicator Shows Truncated Directory Names for Some Components During Upgrade on Windows

*Issue:*
While upgrading OSP, SSPR, and the identity applications components, the installation directory names for these components appear truncated in the progress indicator.

*Workaround:*
There is no workaround at this time.

#### Upgrade Process Fails due to Missing Port Values in the URL

*Issue:*
If the port numbers are not specified in the OSP Oauth redirect URL parameter for each identity application, the upgrade process fails.

*Workaround:*
Before launching the upgrade program, you must manually enter the port numbers in Configuration Update utility. Perform the following steps to specify the port values:

1. Launch the Configuration Update utility.
2. In SSO Clients tab, specify the appropriate port values in all the required URLs.

   Use the following format: protocol://server:port/path

   For example, http://192.0.2.0:80/dash

#### Identity Applications Upgrade Fails to Preserve Branding Settings in the Database

*Issue:*
Identity Manager Dashboardâs Branding page settings are lost after Identity Applications are upgraded. This issue is only observed when the com.netiq.idmdash.client.settings.store.preference parameter is set to Database in the ism.configuration.properties file.

*Workaround:*
Take a backup of the CSS file, located at the <home> directory of the novlua user, before upgrading Identity Applications. Use the CSS file to rework on the customization settings.

#### Unable To Save the Configuration Update Utility After Upgrading Identity Reporting in Standard Edition

*Issue:*
On Linux, after upgrading Identity Reporting in a standard edition, you cannot save the configuration update utility because it prompts for User Application parameters. This issue is observed because the is\_prov parameter in the configupdate.properties.sh file is set to True.

*Workaround:*
Perform the following steps after upgrading Identity Reporting:

1. Log in to the server where Identity Reporting is upgraded.
2. Navigate to the /opt/netiq/idm/apps/configupdate directory.
3. Edit the configupdate.sh.properties file.

   vi configupdate.sh.properties
4. Set the is\_prov parameter to false.

#### Upgrading Tomcat Results in Loss of SSL Certificates

*Issue:*
While upgrading to Identity Manager 4.7, the Tomcat upgrade process does not persist the certificate used for SSL communication between Tomcat and PostgreSQL.

*Workaround:*
Perform the following steps after upgrading Identity Manager 4.7:

1. Import the certificate to the idm.jks keystore.

   For example, on Linux, run the following command:

   /opt/netiq/idm/apps/jre/bin/keytool -import -trustcacerts -alias postgres -file server.crt -keystore /opt/netiq/idm/apps/tomcat/conf/idm.jks
2. Restart Tomcat.

#### Upgrading PostgreSQL Using the Upgrade Script Defaults to Non-SSL Configuration

*Issue:*
When PostgreSQL is upgraded through the pg\_upgrade.sh script, the upgrade process does not preserve the SSL configuration settings.

*Workaround:*
Perform the following steps after upgrading PostgreSQL:

1. Locate the postgresql.conf file:

   *Linux:*
   /opt/netiq/idm/postgres/data

   *Windows:*
   C:\NetIQ\idm\apps\postgres\data
2. Open the file in a text editor and modify the following properties:

   * Set the SSL parameter to On.
   * Provide the server.crt and server.key certificate details in the ssl\_cert\_file and ssl\_key\_file parameters.

#### Identity Manager Installers Contain Corrupt Characters in the Console Mode On Windows

*Issue:*
If you select Brazilian Portuguese, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Swedish, Spanish, or Russian as your choice of language for installing Identity Manager, the installer displays corrupt characters during installation.

If you select English, the installer contains a corrupt character on the Select Language page of the installation program. However, the characters display correctly for the Asian languages when the installer is run on Asian Windows. (Bug 672070)

*Workaround:*
For the characters to display correctly, ensure that you change the default font of your Windows computer to Lucida Console by using the following steps before installing Identity Manager:

1. Go to Start > Run > Regedit > HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Nls\CodePage and change the value of OEMCP from 850 to 1252.

   For Russian, change the value of OEMCP from 866 to 1251 in the HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Nls\CodePage directory.
2. Go to Start > Run and type cmd in the Open text box, then click Enter to launch the command prompt.
3. Right-click the title bar of the Command Prompt window to open the pop-up menu.
4. Scroll down in the pop-up menu and select the Defaults option to open the Console Windows Properties dialog box.

*Workaround:*
There is no workaround at this time.

#### Identity Manager Framework Uninstallation Does Not Remove all of the Folders from the Installation Directory on Windows

*Issue:*
The uninstallation program does not remove the JAR files from the lib directory. (Bug 643077)

*Workaround:*
Manually remove the JAR files from the lib directory.

#### Identity Manager Framework Uninstallation Log Files Are Not Created in the Uninstallation Folder on Windows

*Issue:*
The uninstallation log files are created in the temp directory. (Bug 613225)

*Workaround:*
There is no functionality loss. You can ignore the issue.

#### Uninstall the Identity Manager Entry from the Control Panel after Identity Manager Engine Upgrade on Windows

*Issue:*
After upgrading the Identity Manager engine to version 4.5, if you run the uninstallation program from the Control Panel, it successfully removes the necessary Identity Manager files except a specific registry key that leads to the Identity Manager entry being displayed in the Control Panel even after running the uninstallation.
