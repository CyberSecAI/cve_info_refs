Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7320:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the SIGCOMP dissector within the Wireshark network protocol analyzer. Specifically, the issue is located in the `dissect_udvm_reference_operand_memory` function within the `epan/dissectors/packet-sigcomp.c` file at line 1353, column 16.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow, meaning that a memory buffer is written past its boundary leading to potential corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, causing Wireshark to crash. Additionally, there's a possibility of arbitrary code execution, although this is not explicitly confirmed in the provided text.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attackers can trigger this vulnerability by:
    - Injecting a malformed SIGCOMP packet onto the network.
    - Convincing a user to open a malformed packet trace file containing a malicious SIGCOMP packet.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject crafted SIGCOMP packets onto a network being monitored by Wireshark, or they can trick a user into opening a malicious packet capture file.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the SIGCOMP protocol to craft such packets that will trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability was identified through fuzzing and ASAN (AddressSanitizer), which detected the heap-buffer-overflow.
- The vulnerability is present in Wireshark versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.4 and 2.2.0 to 2.2.12. It is fixed in versions 2.4.5 and 2.2.13 and later.
- The Debian security advisory (DSA 4217-1) also mentions this vulnerability alongside other vulnerabilities affecting the Wireshark dissectors.
- The issue was originally tracked as bug 14398 in Wireshark's old bug tracker.
- The issue was assigned CVE-2018-7320 and it has been fixed.
