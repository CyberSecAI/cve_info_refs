Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7866:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference within the `newVar3` function located in `util/decompile.c`. This occurs when the `getString` function, indirectly called by `getName`, is passed a variable of type `PUSH_VARIABLE` (type 10). If the string contained within the passed variable is NULL, `getString` returns a NULL pointer. Subsequently, when the code attempts to use this returned NULL pointer, a dereference occurs leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service: A remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing a specially crafted SWF file, which causes the application to crash due to the null pointer dereference.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the processing of a maliciously crafted SWF file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious SWF file to a vulnerable application.
- No specific privilege is required.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is fixed by ensuring that if the variable contains an invalid string, it acts the same way it does in `PUSH_STRING` case and returns a copy of the string otherwise.
- The `getString` method was also found to be vulnerable to buffer overflow, which was addressed by introducing the `Offset` method to handle bounds checking when retrieving the offset of `SWF_ACTIONRECORD` objects.
