The provided content is related to CVE-2018-7494.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow. The application uses a fixed-length stack buffer, and it reads a value from a file into this buffer without checking the length. If the value read from the file is larger than the buffer, a stack buffer overflow occurs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121)
- Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122)
- Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787)

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities could lead to:
- Remote code execution
- Application crash

**Attack vectors:**
- Reading a specially crafted file that contains a value larger than the stack/heap buffer in the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide/modify the input file that is being read by the vulnerable application.
- Low skill level to exploit.
- Remotely exploitable
