- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The RTP support in Asterisk incorrectly consulted its internal registry of dynamic codecs and desired payload numbers for all packets, even those with dynamic payloads. This registry is intended for statically defined payloads only. If the payload number resulted in a different codec type than the RTP stream, and no stream of that type had been negotiated, a crash could occur.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect logic in RTP packet processing, specifically in the handling of dynamic payloads and the consultation of the codec registry. Assumption that a stream of the expected type would always exist.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote crash of the Asterisk application.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted RTP packet with an unnegotiated dynamic payload number, which results in a mismatch between the payload type and the RTP stream, triggering the crash.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be unauthenticated and needs to be able to send RTP packets to the Asterisk server.
