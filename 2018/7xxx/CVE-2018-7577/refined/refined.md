The provided content relates to CVE-2018-7577.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a memcpy-param-overlap issue present in the older version of the Snappy compression library used by TensorFlow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a `memcpy-param-overlap` issue, meaning that the source and destination memory regions for the `memcpy` operation overlap, leading to undefined behavior. This occurs during the decompression process using the Snappy library.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A maliciously crafted checkpoint meta file, when processed by TensorFlow using the vulnerable Snappy library, can lead to a crash or reading from other parts of the process's memory. This can potentially allow for information disclosure or further exploitation.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a maliciously crafted TensorFlow checkpoint meta file. An attacker would need to provide this file to a TensorFlow process which uses the vulnerable snappy library for decompression during checkpoint loading.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to provide the maliciously crafted checkpoint meta file to a TensorFlow process that loads it. This may involve control over the input data used by a TensorFlow application or compromising a system that hosts the application.
