Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-7529:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Deserialization of Untrusted Data

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502):** The application deserializes data from untrusted sources, allowing an attacker to modify this data and send custom requests that can crash the server.
*   **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** Unauthenticated users may send unvalidated custom requests, leading to a server crash. (Note: This is a separate vulnerability, CVE-2018-7531, but mentioned in the same advisory)
*   **Incorrect Default Permissions (CWE-276):** Insecure default configurations may allow privilege escalation that could lead to full control of the system. (Note: This is a separate vulnerability, CVE-2018-7533, but mentioned in the same advisory)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Loss of network access to the device.
*   Escalated privileges leading to full control of the PI Data Archive server.
*   Server crashes due to crafted requests.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, meaning the attacker does not need physical access.
*   **Network Access:** Exploitation is performed over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Low Skill Level to Exploit:** The advisory states that the exploit requires a low skill level.
*   **Unauthenticated User:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the deserialization and input validation vulnerabilities.
*   For the privilege escalation vulnerability, a local user with some level of access is required.

**Additional Details:**
*   The advisory mentions the specific affected versions of the PI Data Archive (2017 and prior).
*   It recommends upgrading to PI Data Archive 2017 R2.
*   The advisory provides a link to the OSIsoft advisory.
*   It also includes mitigation advice, including isolating control system networks and using secure methods for remote access.
*   No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities at the time of the advisory.
