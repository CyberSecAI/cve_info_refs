Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7072:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper security restrictions in HPE Moonshot Provisioning Manager prior to version 1.24. Specifically, the web interface allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to move arbitrary files to the MPM upload directory (/opt/hp/moonshot/upload).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated File Move:** An attacker can move arbitrary files to the server's upload directory without authentication.
*   **Insecure File Handling:** The server uses standard 'mv' semantics when moving the file, leading to potential overwriting or deletion of files if an attacker moves a file to an existing path.
*   **Direct File Access:** Files moved to the upload directory can then be retrieved by the attacker via a direct HTTP request to the /upload path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote File Manipulation:** An attacker can overwrite or delete files on the server, potentially causing service disruption or unauthorized changes to the system.
*   **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** Sensitive files moved to the upload directory could be read by the attacker.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By moving files to critical locations or overwriting essential data the attacker could cause a denial of service. The scope is limited to files accessible by the `moonshot:moonshot` user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.
*   **Web Interface:** The attack is performed via the web interface of the HPE Moonshot Provisioning Manager.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** No authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the target system.
*   **Knowledge of the Target URL and Parameters:** The attacker needs to know the URL and specific parameters for the vulnerable `khuploadfile.cgi` script.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is related to CVE-2018-7073, which is a local arbitrary file modification vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Tenable while developing a Nessus plugin to detect [HPESBHF03803](https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=emr_na-hpesbhf03803en_us).
*   The fix is available in HPE Moonshot version 1.24 and later.
*   The Tenable advisory ID for this vulnerability is TRA-2018-15.

**Example Attack:**

The provided curl command demonstrates the attack:

```
curl -kd "isofile.savepath=/opt/hp/moonshot/tinkerbell/cgi-bin/server_response.py&isofile.filename=myfile"  https://[target]/cgi-bin/khuploadfile.cgi
```

This command moves the file `/opt/hp/moonshot/tinkerbell/cgi-bin/server_response.py` to the upload directory as `my_file`. An attacker could then retrieve the file via:

```
curl -k https://[target]/upload/myfile
```

This vulnerability is rated as **critical** with a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8.
