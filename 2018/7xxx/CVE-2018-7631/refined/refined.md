Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2018-7631:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the httpd (web server) of the ADB EpiCentro firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The httpd is vulnerable to a buffer overflow.
- The vulnerability exists when processing HTTP GET requests without a leading "/".
- Lack of authentication allows unauthenticated remote exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows for:
- Remote code execution (RCE).
- Overwriting the frame pointer and return address during program execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request without a leading "/" to the vulnerable httpd.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the affected device.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP GET request.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the EpiCentro 7.3.2+ firmware, used in various VDSL devices by ADB.
- The device uses a MIPS 32-bit processor (Big Endian).
- Memory addresses of loaded modules are consistent across reboots.
- The overwrite of the return address leads to code execution at an attacker-controlled address (minus 1 due to MIPS architecture).
- The CVSS v3 base score is 10.0 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).
