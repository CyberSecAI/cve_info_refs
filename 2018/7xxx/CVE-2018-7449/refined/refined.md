- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The SEGGER embOS/IP FTP Server v3.22 crashes when it receives a malformed LIST, STOR or RETR command.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation when handling specific FTP commands (LIST, STOR, RETR). This leads to a denial-of-service vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by sending malformed FTP commands which crashes the FTP server daemon.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending crafted FTP commands over the network to the vulnerable FTP server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to establish a network connection to the FTP server (port 21) and send commands.
