If blkg_create fails, new_blkg passed as an argument will
be freed by blkg_create, so there is no need to free it again.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2017-5715

    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various
    processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker
    controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary
    addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes
    running on the system.

    This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 2 (branch
    target injection) and is mitigated for the x86 architecture (amd64
    and i386) by using the "retpoline" compiler feature which allows
    indirect branches to be isolated from speculative execution.

CVE-2017-5753

    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various
    processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker
    controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary
    addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes
    running on the system.

    This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 1
    (bounds-check bypass) and is mitigated by identifying vulnerable
    code sections (array bounds checking followed by array access) and
    replacing the array access with the speculation-safe
    array_index_nospec() function.

    More use sites will be added over time.

CVE-2017-17975

    Tuba Yavuz reported a use-after-free flaw in the USBTV007
    audio-video grabber driver. A local user could use this for denial
    of service by triggering failure of audio registration.

CVE-2017-18193

    Yunlei He reported that the f2fs implementation does not properly
    handle extent trees, allowing a local user to cause a denial of
    service via an application with multiple threads.

CVE-2017-18216

    Alex Chen reported that the OCFS2 filesystem failed to hold a
    necessary lock during nodemanager sysfs file operations,
    potentially leading to a null pointer dereference.  A local user
    could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-18218

    Jun He reported a user-after-free flaw in the Hisilicon HNS ethernet
    driver. A local user could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-18222

    It was reported that the Hisilicon Network Subsystem (HNS) driver
    implementation does not properly handle ethtool private flags. A
    local user could use this for denial of service or possibly have
    other impact.

CVE-2017-18224

    Alex Chen reported that the OCFS2 filesystem omits the use of a
    semaphore and consequently has a race condition for access to the
    extent tree during read operations in DIRECT mode. A local user
    could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-18241

    Yunlei He reported that the f2fs implementation does not properly
    initialise its state if the "noflush_merge" mount option is used.
    A local user with access to a filesystem mounted with this option
    could use this to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2017-18257

    It was reported that the f2fs implementation is prone to an infinite
    loop caused by an integer overflow in the __get_data_block()
    function. A local user can use this for denial of service via
    crafted use of the open and fallocate system calls with an
    FS_IOC_FIEMAP ioctl.

CVE-2018-1065

    The syzkaller tool found a NULL pointer dereference flaw in the
    netfilter subsystem when handling certain malformed iptables
    rulesets. A local user with the CAP_NET_RAW or CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability (in any user namespace) could use this to cause a denial
    of service. Debian disables unprivileged user namespaces by default.

CVE-2018-1066

    Dan Aloni reported to Red Hat that the CIFS client implementation
    would dereference a null pointer if the server sent an invalid
    response during NTLMSSP setup negotiation.  This could be used
    by a malicious server for denial of service.

CVE-2018-1068

    The syzkaller tool found that the 32-bit compatibility layer of
    ebtables did not sufficiently validate offset values. On a 64-bit
    kernel, a local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (in any user
    namespace) could use this to overwrite kernel memory, possibly
    leading to privilege escalation. Debian disables unprivileged user
    namespaces by default.

CVE-2018-1092

    Wen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image would
    trigger a null dereference when mounted.  A local user able
    to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this for denial of
    service.

CVE-2018-1093

    Wen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image could trigger
    an out-of-bounds read in the ext4_valid_block_bitmap() function. A
    local user able to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this for
    denial of service.

CVE-2018-1108

    Jann Horn reported that crng_ready() does not properly handle the
    crng_init variable states and the RNG could be treated as
    cryptographically safe too early after system boot.

CVE-2018-5803

    Alexey Kodanev reported that the SCTP protocol did not range-check
    the length of chunks to be created.  A local or remote user could
    use this to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2018-7480

    Hou Tao discovered a double-free flaw in the blkcg_init_queue()
    function in block/blk-cgroup.c. A local user could use this to cause
    a denial of service or have other impact.

CVE-2018-7566

    Fan LongFei reported a race condition in the ALSA (sound)
    sequencer core, between write and ioctl operations.  This could
    lead to an out-of-bounds access or use-after-free.  A local user
    with access to a sequencer device could use this for denial of
    service or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-7740

    Nic Losby reported that the hugetlbfs filesystem's mmap operation
    did not properly range-check the file offset.  A local user with
    access to files on a hugetlbfs filesystem could use this to cause
    a denial of service.

CVE-2018-7757

    Jason Yan reported a memory leak in the SAS (Serial-Attached
    SCSI) subsystem.  A local user on a system with SAS devices
    could use this to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2018-7995

    Seunghun Han reported a race condition in the x86 MCE
    (Machine Check Exception) driver.  This is unlikely to have
    any security impact.

CVE-2018-8087

    A memory leak flaw was found in the hwsim_new_radio_nl() function in
    the simulated radio testing tool driver for mac80211, allowing a
    local user to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2018-8781

    Eyal Itkin reported that the udl (DisplayLink) driver's mmap
    operation did not properly range-check the file offset.  A local
    user with access to a udl framebuffer device could exploit this to
    overwrite kernel memory, leading to privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-8822

    Dr Silvio Cesare of InfoSect reported that the ncpfs client
    implementation did not validate reply lengths from the server.  An
    ncpfs server could use this to cause a denial of service or
    remote code execution in the client.

CVE-2018-10323

    Wen Xu reported a NULL pointer dereference flaw in the
    xfs_bmapi_write() function triggered when mounting and operating a
    crafted xfs filesystem image. A local user able to mount arbitrary
    filesystems could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2018-1000199

    Andy Lutomirski discovered that the ptrace subsystem did not
    sufficiently validate hardware breakpoint settings.  Local users
    can use this to cause a denial of service, or possibly for
    privilege escalation, on x86 (amd64 and i386) and possibly other
    architectures.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.88-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

## Details

Jann Horn and Ken Johnson discovered that microprocessors utilizing

speculative execution of a memory read may allow unauthorized memory

reads via a sidechannel attack. This flaw is known as Spectre

Variant 4. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information, including kernel memory. ([CVE-2018-3639](/security/CVE-2018-3639))

Tuba Yavuz discovered that a double-free error existed in the USBTV007

driver of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2017-17975](/security/CVE-2017-17975))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the F2FS implementation

in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-18193](/security/CVE-2017-18193))

It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the Hisilicon HNS

Ethernet Device driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2017-18222](/security/CVE-2017-18222))

It was discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not

validate that rules containing jumps contained user-defined chains. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-1065](/security/CVE-2018-1065))

It was discovered that the netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel did not

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-1068](/security/CVE-2018-1068))

It was discovered that a null pointer dereference vulnerability existed in

the DCCP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-1130](/security/CVE-2018-1130))

It was discovered that the SCTP Protocol implementation in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate userspace provided payload lengths in some

situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2018-5803](/security/CVE-2018-5803))

It was discovered that a double free error existed in the block layer

subsystem of the Linux kernel when setting up a request queue. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-7480](/security/CVE-2018-7480))

It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the SAS driver subsystem of

the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2018-7757](/security/CVE-2018-7757))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the x86 machine check

handler in the Linux kernel. A local privileged attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-7995](/security/CVE-2018-7995))

Eyal Itkin discovered that the USB displaylink video adapter driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate mmap offsets sent from userspace. A

local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel

memory) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-8781](/security/CVE-2018-8781))

Silvio Cesare discovered a buffer overwrite existed in the NCPFS

implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker controlling a

malicious NCPFS server could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-8822](/security/CVE-2018-8822))

Please note that fully mitigating CVE-2018-3639 (Spectre Variant 4)

may require corresponding processor microcode/firmware updates or,

in virtual environments, hypervisor updates. On i386 and amd64

architectures, the SSBD feature is required to enable the kernel

mitigations. BIOS vendors will be making updates available for Intel

processors that implement SSBD and Ubuntu is working with Intel to

provide future microcode updates. Ubuntu users with a processor from

a different vendor should contact the vendor to identify necessary

firmware updates. Ubuntu provided corresponding QEMU updates for users

of self-hosted virtual environments in USN 3651-1. Ubuntu users in

cloud environments should contact the cloud provider to confirm that

the hypervisor has been updated to expose the new CPU features to

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-lts-xenial](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-xenial) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Xenial for Trusty

## Details

USN-3654-1 fixed vulnerabilities and added mitigations in the Linux

kernel for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. This update provides the corresponding

updates for the Linux Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu

16.04 LTS for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

Jann Horn and Ken Johnson discovered that microprocessors utilizing

speculative execution of a memory read may allow unauthorized memory

reads via a sidechannel attack. This flaw is known as Spectre

Variant 4. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information, including kernel memory. ([CVE-2018-3639](/security/CVE-2018-3639))

Tuba Yavuz discovered that a double-free error existed in the USBTV007

driver of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2017-17975](/security/CVE-2017-17975))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the F2FS implementation

in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-18193](/security/CVE-2017-18193))

It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the Hisilicon HNS

Ethernet Device driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2017-18222](/security/CVE-2017-18222))

It was discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not

validate that rules containing jumps contained user-defined chains. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-1065](/security/CVE-2018-1065))

It was discovered that the netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel did not

properly validate ebtables offsets. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-1068](/security/CVE-2018-1068))

It was discovered that a null pointer dereference vulnerability existed in

the DCCP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-1130](/security/CVE-2018-1130))

It was discovered that the SCTP Protocol implementation in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate userspace provided payload lengths in some

situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2018-5803](/security/CVE-2018-5803))

It was discovered that a double free error existed in the block layer

subsystem of the Linux kernel when setting up a request queue. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-7480](/security/CVE-2018-7480))

It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the SAS driver subsystem of

the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2018-7757](/security/CVE-2018-7757))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the x86 machine check

handler in the Linux kernel. A local privileged attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-7995](/security/CVE-2018-7995))

Eyal Itkin discovered that the USB displaylink video adapter driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate mmap offsets sent from userspace. A

local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel

memory) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-8781](/security/CVE-2018-8781))

Silvio Cesare discovered a buffer overwrite existed in the NCPFS

implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker controlling a

malicious NCPFS server could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-8822](/security/CVE-2018-8822))

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux-raspi2](/security/cves?package=linux-raspi2) - Linux kernel for Raspberry Pi 2
* [linux-snapdragon](/security/cves?package=linux-snapdragon) - Linux kernel for Snapdragon processors

## Details

Tuba Yavuz discovered that a double-free error existed in the USBTV007

driver of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2017-17975](/security/CVE-2017-17975))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the F2FS implementation

in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-18193](/security/CVE-2017-18193))

It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the Hisilicon HNS

Ethernet Device driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2017-18222](/security/CVE-2017-18222))

It was discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not

validate that rules containing jumps contained user-defined chains. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-1065](/security/CVE-2018-1065))

It was discovered that the netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel did not

properly validate ebtables offsets. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-1068](/security/CVE-2018-1068))

It was discovered that a null pointer dereference vulnerability existed in

the DCCP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-1130](/security/CVE-2018-1130))

It was discovered that the SCTP Protocol implementation in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate userspace provided payload lengths in some

situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2018-5803](/security/CVE-2018-5803))

It was discovered that a double free error existed in the block layer

subsystem of the Linux kernel when setting up a request queue. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-7480](/security/CVE-2018-7480))

It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the SAS driver subsystem of

the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2018-7757](/security/CVE-2018-7757))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the x86 machine check

handler in the Linux kernel. A local privileged attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-7995](/security/CVE-2018-7995))

Eyal Itkin discovered that the USB displaylink video adapter driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate mmap offsets sent from userspace. A

local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel

memory) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-8781](/security/CVE-2018-8781))

Silvio Cesare discovered a buffer overwrite existed in the NCPFS

implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker controlling a

malicious NCPFS server could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-8822](/security/CVE-2018-8822))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.4.0-1090-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2)
  -
  [4.4.0-1090.98](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2/4.4.0-1090.98)
* [linux-image-4.4.0-1093-snapdragon](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-snapdragon)
  -
  [4.4.0-1093.98](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-snapdragon/4.4.0-1093.98)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.
