Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7480:

**Root Cause:**
- A double-free vulnerability exists in the `blkcg_init_queue()` function within the `block/blk-cgroup.c` file of the Linux kernel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The code incorrectly attempts to free the `new_blkg` block twice. If `blkg_create` fails, `new_blkg` which was passed as an argument will already be freed by blkg_create function and should not be freed again within `blkcg_init_queue`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to a denial of service (system crash). It is also mentioned that the vulnerability could potentially have other impacts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by a local user.
- The specific conditions that trigger the double free likely involve failures during the block cgroup initialization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- A local user account is needed to trigger this vulnerability. The user does not need any special privileges.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability is a simple removal of the redundant free call in `blkcg_init_queue`.
-  The Debian and Ubuntu security notices confirm that this vulnerability could lead to a denial of service. The ubuntu notices also note "possibly execute arbitrary code".
