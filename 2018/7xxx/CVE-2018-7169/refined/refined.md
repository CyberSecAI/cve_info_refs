```
Root cause of vulnerability: The `newgidmap` setuid executable allows a user to write a single mapping line to the gid_map of a process, mapping their own GID to GID 0 inside a user namespace. This mapping is done without checking the content of `/proc/$process_being_mapped/setgroups`, which initially contains "allow".

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Improper privilege management in `newgidmap` allowing unprivileged users to manipulate group mappings.
- Lack of check for `setgroups` status before modifying gid\_map, thus circumventing security feature meant to restrict group changes.

Impact of exploitation:
- Local privilege escalation
- Bypassing security restrictions, allowing a user to drop supplementary groups and access resources they should not have access to.
- The ability to circumvent the intended use of supplementary groups as blacklists for file system access.

Attack vectors:
- Local attacker executes `newgidmap` to alter group mappings within a user namespace.
- Attackers leverage `newuidmap` to write uid_map and then `newgidmap` to manipulate gid_map.
- Then `setgroups(2)` can be used in the new user namespace to drop supplementary groups.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Local user access to the system.
- Ability to execute `newgidmap`.
- Ability to create a user namespace.
