Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7477:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is due to an SQL injection flaw in the `parent_login.php` file of the School Management Script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when handling login credentials, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Authentication Bypass:** By injecting SQL code (specifically `'or'x'='x`), an attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism and log in as an administrator, or potentially any other user depending on the implementation and vulnerable code paths.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface of the application, specifically the login page for parents (`parents/Parent_module/parent_login.php`).
*   **Malicious Input:** The attacker provides malicious SQL code in the username and password fields of the login form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable login page over the network.
*   No prior knowledge of the user credentials is required.
*   The attacker only needs to inject the SQL payload in the login form.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable version of the application is School Management Script 3.0.4.
*   The exploit is demonstrated to work with the SQL injection payload `x'or'x'='x` in the username and password fields.
*   The vulnerability was identified and reported by Samiran Santra.
