Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2018-7817:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free (UAF) error.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-After-Free (CWE-416):  The software attempts to use memory after it has been freed, leading to unpredictable behavior, including potential crashes or remote code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted Zelio Soft project file.
- The attack vector is primarily through a malicious file, not network-based exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious Zelio Soft project file.
- The user must open the malicious file for exploitation to occur.
- The CVSS vector string indicates the exploit is local, requires user interaction (opening a crafted file), and has high impacts to confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Additional Details:**
- Affected Product: Schneider Electric Zelio Soft 2 versions 5.1 and prior.
-  A patch is available in version 5.2 of Zelio Soft 2.
- The vulnerability was reported by Trend Microâ€™s Zero Day Initiative working with rgod and mdm of 9SG Security Team.
- While the advisory says "This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely," this likely means directly over a network, not that the attack vector can't originate remotely (e.g. via email).
