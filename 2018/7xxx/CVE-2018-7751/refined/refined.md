Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7751:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `img2dec.c` file within the FFmpeg library. Specifically, it's an infinite loop issue that can be triggered during the processing of image files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- An infinite loop vulnerability in the `img2dec` decoder.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- A successful exploit leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- The vulnerable FFmpeg process gets stuck in an infinite loop, consuming resources and becoming unresponsive.
- Gentoo security advisory mentions potential for arbitrary code execution, although not explicit in the commit log itself.

**Attack vectors:**

- A specially crafted image file is used as input to FFmpeg.
- The file is designed to trigger the infinite loop during processing.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to supply the crafted image file to FFmpeg.
- This could be achieved through various means, such as:
    - Enticing a user to open the file.
    - Triggering FFmpeg processing of the file through an automated system.
- The attacker can be either local or remote, depending on the way the crafted file is used.

**Additional Notes:**

- The commit log indicates a fix for the infinite loop.
- The Gentoo security advisory lists CVE-2018-7751 along with other vulnerabilities, all fixed in FFmpeg version 4.2.0.
- The vulnerability was found by Kira <kira_cxy@foxmail.com>.
