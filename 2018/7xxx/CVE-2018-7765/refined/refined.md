Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-7841

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `object_id` parameter within the `track_import_export.php` script. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of arbitrary commands into a PHP `exec` call. This is a bypass to the fix implemented for CVE-2018-7765.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The application directly incorporates user input into an operating system command without proper validation or sanitization.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring user authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the server.
- **Complete System Compromise:** This can lead to a complete compromise of the affected installation, allowing the attacker to potentially access sensitive data, modify system configurations, or install malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET/POST Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP POST request to the vulnerable `track_import_export.php` script, injecting commands within the `object_id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network-level access to a vulnerable instance of Schneider Electric U.Motion Builder or a product that depends on it.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is located in `track_import_export.php`.
- The vendor was notified about the vulnerability, but the product was retired shortly after the notification, so no fix was published.
- The provided Proof-of-Concept (PoC) demonstrates the injection of a `sleep 10` command, which can be substituted with other commands.
