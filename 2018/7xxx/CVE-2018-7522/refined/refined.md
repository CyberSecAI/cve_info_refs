Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-7522:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an **Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (CWE-119)**.
*   Specifically, when a system call is made, registers are stored to a fixed memory location. The vulnerability arises because this memory location isn't properly protected.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** Modifying the data in the fixed memory location where registers are stored during system calls allows for memory corruption.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The system doesn't validate the data being written to the fixed memory location.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** By modifying the stored register data, an attacker can gain supervisor-level access.
*   **System Control:** With supervisor-level access, the attacker can manipulate the system's state and potentially execute arbitrary code.
*   **System Compromise**: Attackers can gain control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is described as local ("AV:L"). This indicates that the attacker needs to have some form of access to the system either directly or indirectly, likely through the local network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **High Privileges:** The attacker needs high privileges to exploit the vulnerability ("PR:H"). This implies that an attacker needs existing elevated access to modify the stored registers.
*   **Low Attack Complexity:** The attack has a low complexity ("AC:L"), meaning it is relatively easy to exploit once the attacker has the required privileges.
*   **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is required ("UI:N"). The attacker does not require a user to perform an action for the exploit to occur.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability is specifically associated with Schneider Electric's Triconex Tricon Safety Instrumented System, model 3008.
* The vulnerability is related to the HatMan malware, which specifically targeted these vulnerabilities
*   The CVSS v3 base score for this vulnerability is 7.9, with a vector string of AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H, which translates to:
    *   Attack Vector: Local
    *   Attack Complexity: Low
    *   Privileges Required: High
    *   User Interaction: None
    *   Scope: Changed
    *   Confidentiality: None
    *   Integrity: High
    *   Availability: High
*   The provided document also contains mitigation recommendations, which include:
    *   Upgrading to the latest Triconex Tricon CX version.
    *   Implementing network segmentation and isolation.
    *   Enabling cybersecurity features.
    *   Implementing physical controls for the safety controllers.
    *   Scanning removable media before use.
    *   Ensuring engineering workstations are secured and not connected to untrusted networks.
