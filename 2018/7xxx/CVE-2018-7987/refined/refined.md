- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The software does not properly handle response messages during certain inquiry operations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists due to improper handling of response messages.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker sends a crafted message to the device after a user initiates a specific inquiry operation and tampers with the response message.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify network communications between the device and the server. The attacker needs to send crafted messages after a specific user action.
