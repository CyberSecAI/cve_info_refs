- **Root cause of vulnerability:**
    - **Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls (CWE-264):** Improper handling of permissions, privileges, and access controls can lead to privilege escalation.
    - **Cross-site Scripting (CWE-79):** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation can lead to cross-site scripting.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Privilege escalation due to insufficient access controls.
    - Cross-site scripting due to improper input sanitization.

- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - **Privilege escalation:** Attackers may gain elevated privileges, potentially accessing the PI System through the service account.
    - **Cross-site scripting:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts, leading to potential compromise of user sessions or redirection to malicious sites.
   - Remote code execution.

- **Attack vectors:**
    - **Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely with low skill level required.
    - **Cross-site scripting:** Exploitable remotely but requires user interaction.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - **Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls:** No specific user privileges are required.
    - **Cross-site scripting:** Requires user interaction (victim must visit the malicious link/page).
