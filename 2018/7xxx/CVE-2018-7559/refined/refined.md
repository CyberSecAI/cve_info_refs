{
  "related": true,
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the inclusion of the Basic128Rsa15 security policy, which is considered weak, in the default configurations of OPC UA .NET applications.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of a weak cryptographic algorithm (Basic128Rsa15)"
    ],
    "impact": "Exploitation could lead to weakened security, potentially allowing unauthorized access, data interception, or tampering due to the use of a less secure cryptographic method.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker could potentially exploit the weak cryptographic policy by forcing a connection to the server using this policy, thus compromising the data exchanged or gaining unauthorized access.",
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker would need to be able to connect to an OPC UA server configured to allow Basic128Rsa15 and then exploit that for unauthorized actions. The attacker would likely need to be on the same network as the server or have network access to the server"
