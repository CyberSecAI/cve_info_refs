Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7891:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an exploitable .NET Framework Remoting deserialization issue within the Siveillance VMS software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The core issue is the improper handling of deserialization in .NET Remoting, which allows an attacker to inject malicious payloads.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privileges:** Successful exploitation could grant the attacker higher levels of access within the system.
*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can also be used to disrupt the service, making it unavailable.
*   **Compromised Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** The vulnerability could lead to a complete compromise of the targeted system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to specific vulnerable ports, including:
    *   7474/TCP
    *   9993/TCP
    *   6473/TCP (local connection only)
    *   8966/TCP (local connection only)
*   **Malicious Payload:** Exploitation involves sending a specially crafted malicious payload through the .NET Remoting interface which gets deserialized

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the vulnerable ports of the Siveillance VMS server.
*   **Knowledge of .NET Remoting:** A basic understanding of .NET Remoting and the ability to craft malicious deserialization payloads are required.
*   **No authentication is mentioned**, thus any attacker with access to the vulnerable ports might be able to exploit it.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects the Recording Server, Management Server, and Management Client components of Siveillance VMS.
*   Siemens is aware of the issue and has released software updates to address the problem.
*   Workarounds include restricting network access to the affected ports (7474/TCP and 9993/TCP)
*   The CVSS v3.0 base score is 8.1, with a vector string: `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C`

The information provided is consistent with the description of insecure deserialization vulnerabilities.
