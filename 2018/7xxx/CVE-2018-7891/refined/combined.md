PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Siveillance VMS is an IP video management software (VMS) designed for deployments ranging from
small to large-scale. Its single management interface enables the efﬁcient administration of the system
including multiple cameras and security devices.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.0
(CVSS v3.0) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-7891

The Recording Server, Management Server, and Management Client on ports 6473/TCP local
connection only, 7474/TCP, 8966/TCP local connection only, and port 9993/TCP use an exploitable
.NET Framework Remoting deserialization level.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with access to the vulnerable ports and
could allow elevation of privileges or causing a Denial-of-Service, compromising conﬁdentiality, integrity
and availability of the targeted system.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.
Siemens conﬁrms the security vulnerability and provides mitigations to resolve the security issue.
