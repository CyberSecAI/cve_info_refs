The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities found in osTicket, and one of them is related to CVE-2018-7196.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper input sanitization in the `sort` parameter of the `index.php` page in the osTicket Agent panel.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript code execution in the victim's browser.
- Potential for session hijacking if the `HttpOnly` flag is missing from the session cookie.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload.
- The victim (a logged-in agent) visits the malicious URL through a link or any other means.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to know the hostname of the osTicket installation.
- The victim needs to be a signed-in user with access to the Agent panel.
- The attacker needs to trick the victim into clicking the malicious link.

**Technical Details:**
The malicious URL is structured as follows:
```
http://osTicket.host/scp/index.php?sort="><script>alert(64);</script>&dir=1
```
This URL injects a JavaScript payload `"<script>alert(64);</script>"` into the `sort` parameter.
