Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7487:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `LoadPCX` function, specifically within the `in_pcx.cpp` file at line 241.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: A write operation of size 1 byte goes beyond the allocated buffer, which has a size of 108 bytes.
- The vulnerability is triggered during the processing of a PCX image file. The error occurs specifically when reading the color map of a truncated or malformed PCX file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service: The heap-buffer-overflow can cause the application to crash due to a memory access violation, leading to a denial of service.
- Unspecified other impact: The Debian security advisory mentions "unspecified other impact" which could potentially include more severe consequences like arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by providing a specially crafted PCX image file as input to the `sam2p` utility.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply an arbitrary PCX image file to be processed by the `sam2p` utility.
- The attacker has to provide a specially crafted file such that it triggers the heap overflow in the `LoadPCX` function.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided ASAN (AddressSanitizer) output gives a detailed stack trace of the crash, pinpointing the `LoadPCX` function, the `in_pcx_reader`, the `Image::load` function, and the `run_sam2p_engine` as locations of the crash.
- The ASAN output also confirms the heap-buffer-overflow at the address `0x60b00000ae9e` which is 2 bytes past the end of allocated region.
- The Debian security advisory `DLA-1340-1` explicitly lists `CVE-2018-7487` alongside other vulnerabilities fixed in the `sam2p` package.
- A POC file is provided in the github issue, which can be used to reproduce the issue.
