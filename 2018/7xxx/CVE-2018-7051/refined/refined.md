Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7051:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Irssi handles certain nicknames when printing theme strings. Specifically, certain crafted nicknames can lead to an out-of-bounds access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-126 (Out-of-bounds Read):** The core issue is an out-of-bounds read when processing specific nicknames within theme strings. This means the program attempts to access memory outside the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure**: The provided information indicates that an attacker could possibly use this vulnerability to access sensitive information. This is because out-of-bounds reads can potentially expose data that is not intended to be accessed by the user.
- **Crash:** While not stated directly as a primary impact, out-of-bounds reads are often related to program crashes as a consequence of attempting to access memory outside of the programs control.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious or crafted nickname is introduced into the IRC channel.
- When Irssi attempts to print the nickname, specifically when rendering theme strings that contain the nickname, the out-of-bounds read is triggered.
- The specific method to introduce such names and which parts of the theme string generation are affected is not detailed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to influence or control nicknames that are visible to a user running a vulnerable version of Irssi. This can be done through direct messaging or by participating in a channel where the user is present.
- The attacker does not need direct access to the system running irssi, as the vulnerability is triggered by data processed by the application.

**Additional Information**
- The vulnerability was found by Oss-Fuzz
- This vulnerability affects Irssi versions 0.8.7 and later.
- The fix is included in Irssi versions 1.0.7 and 1.1.1.
