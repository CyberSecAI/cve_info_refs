{
  "CVE-2018-7643": {
    "Description": "The display_debug_ranges function in dwarf.c in GNU Binutils 2.30 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (integer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted ELF file, as demonstrated by objdump.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow in the display_debug_ranges function when handling DWARF debug information within an ELF file.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow vulnerability",
        "Improper handling of potentially malformed data structures in ELF files"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (application crash), potentially other unspecified impacts.",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker could entice a user to compile/execute a specially crafted ELF, object, PE, or binary file.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to create or modify an ELF file and have it processed by the vulnerable software. No special privileges are needed."
