Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-7435:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer over-read in the `freexl::destroy_cell` function within the FreeXL library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Heap-buffer-over-read: A read operation accesses memory beyond the allocated buffer. Specifically, it reads 1 byte from an address 15 bytes beyond the allocated region.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Denial of Service (DoS): The heap-buffer-over-read can lead to a crash (segmentation fault) of the application using the FreeXL library, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Maliciously crafted Excel (.xls) file: The vulnerability can be triggered by opening a specially crafted Excel file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted Excel file to the vulnerable application that uses the FreeXL library.

**Technical Details:**

*   The `destroy_cell` function attempts to read from a memory address that is outside the allocated boundary for the cell. This occurs when parsing a malformed or specially crafted excel file
*   The crash occurs during a read operation within the `destroy_cell` function.
*   The vulnerability was present in FreeXL version 1.0.4

**Additional notes:**
*   The vulnerability is addressed in freexl version 1.0.5

**Summary:**

CVE-2018-7435 is a heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability in the `freexl::destroy_cell` function of the FreeXL library. It can be exploited by providing a crafted Excel file, leading to a denial-of-service. The fix is available in FreeXL version 1.0.5.
