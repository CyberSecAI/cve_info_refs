```
- Root cause of vulnerability: Heap-based buffer overflow in the `getString` function during a `RegisterNumber sprintf`.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Heap-based buffer overflow.
- Impact of exploitation: Denial of service.
- Attack vectors: Exploitation occurs via a crafted SWF file.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to provide a crafted SWF file to the vulnerable application.
