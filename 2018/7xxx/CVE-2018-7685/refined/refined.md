Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7685:

**1. Root cause of vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability stems from how `libzypp` handles downloaded RPM packages, specifically when download and installation steps are decoupled. Malicious warnings displayed only during download are not retained leading to potentially corrupted packages being installed later without any warning. Specifically, if a user cancels the installation of an unsigned package after being prompted, the package is still cached. Subsequent attempts to install that package will not display a warning about the missing signature, allowing for silent, malicious installations.

**2. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
   - **Insecure caching behavior:**  `libzypp` caches downloaded RPM packages even if a signature verification fails or the download is interrupted by user cancellation. These cached packages are then treated as trustworthy in later installation attempts.
    - **Decoupled download and install:** The fact that download and install stages are separate, with security warnings only appearing during the download phase is a critical factor
   - **Lack of persistent security warnings:** Once the package is cached, the system does not retain the fact that it was unsigned or had a failed signature check; therefore, warnings are not displayed on subsequent install attempts.

**3. Impact of exploitation:**
    - **Installation of unsigned/corrupted packages:** An attacker can inject malicious RPM packages into a user's system via a corrupted or unsigned repository. By cancelling installation the malicious package can end up in the local cache and the user can install it later without warning.
    - **System compromise:** Successfully exploiting the vulnerability can lead to a system compromise since the attacker can execute arbitrary code through the malicious RPM package.
    - **Silent installation:** Unsigned packages may be installed without a warning to the user, potentially leading to an undetectable compromise.

**4. Attack vectors:**
    - **Compromised mirror server:** An attacker can use a compromised or malicious mirror server to host the malicious or unsigned RPMs, tricking users into downloading it.
    - **Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack:** An attacker could intercept and modify repository metadata or package files in transit, replacing signed content with unsigned, malicious content or just injecting a malicious warning during the download phase.

**5. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - **Network access:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept the package download (MitM) or control a mirror server.
    - **Ability to create or modify RPM packages:** The attacker must be able to create malicious RPM packages that can be injected.
    - **Local access:** To exploit the caching weakness, the attacker can trigger the initial download with the security warning, but a subsequent install attempt can be performed by the attacker with local access and privileges

**Additional details:**

* The content also references  CVE-2017-7435 and CVE-2017-7436, and CVE-2017-9269 as related issues.
* It mentions various fixes and workarounds, including changes to libzypp and zypper configuration options related to GPG checking, and the introduction of command-line options.
* The fix requires changes to how `libzypp` and `zypper` handle GPG signature checks, with improved messages and caching mechanisms.
* It highlights that the vulnerability was discovered by Till DÃ¶rges and Moritz Duge of PRESENSE Technologies.
* Several SUSE security updates address this vulnerability (SUSE-SU-2018:2555-1, SUSE-SU-2018:2688-1, etc.)
* The fix involves checking the signature before caching an RPM, and if a verification fails, the package is not cached.
* It also introduces new options in zypper to tune the GPG check settings, allowing more fine-grained control over signature checks.
* The issue exists due to the decoupled download and installation steps in libzypp where malicious warnings are only displayed during the download phase.
