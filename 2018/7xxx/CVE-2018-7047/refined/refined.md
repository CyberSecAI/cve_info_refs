Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure default configuration of the Wowza Streaming Engine MBeans Server, which has JMX enabled by default using weak default credentials. This allows unauthorized access to the server's management interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Permissions:** The MBeans server's JMX interface is not properly secured, allowing access with default credentials.
*   **Default Credentials:** The use of default JMX username/password combinations makes it easy for attackers to gain unauthorized access.
*   **Enabled by Default:** JMX is enabled by default, increasing the attack surface.
*   **Remote Access:** The JMX interface allows remote access, further expanding the scope of the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **File System Read/Write:** Attackers can read and write to the file system.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** The ability to read/write to the file system via JMX may lead to remote code execution.
*  **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in escalation of privileges as the attacker can perform administrative actions on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is accessible over the network.
*   **JMX Interface:** The attack vector is through the JMX interface exposed by the MBeans server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the target system.
*   **JMX Knowledge:** The attacker should have knowledge of how to interact with JMX and its related technologies.
*   **Default Credentials:** The attacker would need to use the default JMX username/password.

**Additional Information:**

* The vulnerability was mitigated in Wowza Streaming Engine version 4.7.1.
* The vendor has confirmed the vulnerability.
* The provided content suggests that the default JMX permissions were updated to readonly and Server.readConfig() and Server.writeConfig mbeans were disabled in the 4.7.1 release.
