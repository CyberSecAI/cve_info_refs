| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1661002#c0)  Laura Pardo    2018-12-19 19:45:15 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in Node.js versions before 6.15.0, 8.14.0, 10.14.0 and 11.3.0. A Denial of Service with large HTTP headers. By using a combination of many requests with maximum sized headers (almost 80 KB per connection), and carefully timed completion of the headers, it is possible to cause the HTTP server to abort from heap allocation failure. Attack potential is mitigated by the use of a load balancer or other proxy layer.    References: <https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/november-2018-security-releases/>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1661002#c1)  Laura Pardo    2018-12-19 19:45:33 UTC  ``` Created nodejs tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-all [[bug 1661004](show_bug.cgi?id=1661004 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2018-12121 nodejs: Denial of Service with large HTTP headers [epel-all]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1661003](show_bug.cgi?id=1661003 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2018-12121 nodejs: Denial of Service with large HTTP headers [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1661002#c2)  Cedric Buissart    2019-01-10 14:22:10 UTC  ``` Upstream fix: (master)    <https://github.com/nodejs/node/commit/18603524> (node.js 6) <https://github.com/nodejs/node/commit/92231a56>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1661002#c4)  Cedric Buissart    2019-01-14 13:58:24 UTC  ``` Note: The original fix, reducing the maximum header length down to 8K (instead of 80K) has been found to lead to regressions. A 2nd commit added the ability to modify the maximum header size on the fly :  Upstream fixes: For node.js :      + <https://github.com/nodejs/node/commit/cdcb1b77>     + <https://github.com/nodejs/node/commit/632f2633>  For http-parser:      + <https://github.com/nodejs/http-parser/commit/0ae8d93f>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1661002#c8)  Sam Fowler    2019-06-13 06:25:17 UTC  ``` Statement:  The nodejs RPMs shipped in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) versions 3.6 through 3.10 are vulnerable to this flaw because they contain the affected code. Later versions of OCP used nodejs RPMs delivered from Red Hat Software Collections and Red Hat Enterprise Linux channels.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1661002#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-07-22 13:37:52 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 EUS  Via RHSA-2019:1821 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1821](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A1821)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1661002#c13)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-07-22 15:06:57 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Moderate: http-parser security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2019%3A2258)

## Topic

An update for http-parser is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The http-parser package provides a utility for parsing HTTP messages. It parses both requests and responses. The parser is designed to be used in performance HTTP applications. It does not make any system calls or allocations, it does not buffer data, and it can be interrupted at any time. Depending on your architecture, it only requires about 40 bytes of data per message stream.

Security Fix(es):

* nodejs: Denial of Service with large HTTP headers (CVE-2018-12121)
* nodejs: HTTP parser allowed for spaces inside Content-Length header values (CVE-2018-7159)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Additional Changes:

March 2018 Security Releases
# [*(Update 28-March-2018)* Security releases available](#update-28-march-2018-security-releases-available)

## [Summary](#summary)

Updates are now available for all active Node.js release lines. These include the fix for the vulnerabilities identified in the initial announcement (below).

In addition to the vulnerabilities in the initial announcement, we have also included a fix for a vulnerability in the Node.js inspector functionality. This is described in detail below.

We recommend that all users upgrade as soon as possible.

## [Downloads & release details](#downloads--release-details)

* [Node.js 9.10.0 (Current)](/en/blog/release/v9.10.0)
* [Node.js 8.11.0 (LTS "Carbon")](/en/blog/release/v8.11.0)
* [Node.js 6.14.0 (LTS "Boron")](/en/blog/release/v6.14.0)
* [Node.js 4.9.0 (LTS "Argon")](/en/blog/release/v4.9.0)

## [OpenSSL 1.0.2o](#openssl-102o)

OpenSSL version 1.0.2o was released this week. It fixed a [flaw that primarily relates to PKCS#7](https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#CVE-2018-0739) that may be used to cause a denial of service (DoS) attack (CVE-2018-0739). As PKCS#7 is not currently supported by Node.js and this flaw does not impact SSL/TLS functionality, our crypto team do not believe this has any impact on Node.js users.

OpenSSL 1.0.2o also contains a small number of code changes that are part of the OpenSSL project's continued code cleanup efforts. It is included in the releases for all Node.js release lines regardless of security impact.

## [Node.js Inspector DNS rebinding vulnerability (CVE-2018-7160)](#nodejs-inspector-dns-rebinding-vulnerability-cve-2018-7160)

Node.js 6.x and later include a [debugger protocol](https://nodejs.org/docs/inspector/) (also known as "inspector") that can be activated by the `--inspect` and related command line flags. This debugger service was vulnerable to a [DNS rebinding attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_rebinding) which could be exploited to perform remote code execution.

The attack was possible from malicious websites open in a web browser on the same computer, or another computer with network access to the computer running the Node.js process. A malicious website could use a DNS rebinding attack to trick the web browser to bypass [same-origin-policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy) checks and to allow HTTP connections to localhost or to hosts on the local network. If a Node.js process with the debug port active is running on localhost or on a host on the local network, the malicious website could connect to it as a debugger, and get full code execution access.

We updated the inspector implementation with an additional check for the browser provided `Host` header. If the connection is via a hostname, i.e. subject to DNS resolution, we ensure that the connection is to either `localhost` or `localhost6` precisely.

Note that this mitigation may affect some remote debugging scenarios. For example it may no longer be possible to debug a remote computer by using a hostname. Either connect using the IP address or use an ssh-tunnel to work around this additional security check. This change is therefore a *"breaking change"*, however, as per the [Node.js release plan](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-plan), we are including this as a security fix on all impacted release lines as a **semver-minor** rather than semver-major increment.

Node.js versions 4.x were *not* vulnerable as the inspector debug protocol is not available in that release line.

The severity of this vulnerability is HIGH due to remote code execution risk. However, the impact should be limited to environments (e.g. development) where debuggers are typically used.

This vulnerability was reported by Timo Schmid.

## [`'path'` module regular expression denial of service (CVE-2018-7158)](#path-module-regular-expression-denial-of-service-cve-2018-7158)

The `'path'` module in the **Node.js 4.x** release line contains a potential regular expression denial of service ([ReDoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReDoS)) vector. The code in question was replaced in Node.js 6.x and later so this vulnerability only impacts all versions of Node.js 4.x.

The regular expression, `splitPathRe`, used within the `'path'` module for the various path parsing functions, including `path.dirname()`, `path.extname()` and `path.parse()` was structured in such a way as to allow an attacker to craft a string, that when passed through one of these functions, could take a significant amount of time to evaluate, potentially leading to a full denial of service.

We have determined the security risk of this vulnerability to Node.js users to be HIGH and recommend upgrading your Node.js 4.x installations as soon as possible.

This vulnerability was reported by James Davis of Virginia Tech.

## [Spaces in HTTP `Content-Length` header values are ignored (CVE-2018-7159)](#spaces-in-http-content-length-header-values-are-ignored-cve-2018-7159)

The HTTP parser in all current versions of Node.js ignores spaces in the `Content-Length` header, allowing input such as `Content-Length: 1 2` to be interpreted as having a value of `12`. The HTTP specification does not allow for spaces in the `Content-Length` value and the Node.js HTTP parser has been brought into line on this particular difference.

We have determined the security risk of this flaw to Node.js users to be VERY LOW as it is difficult, and may be impossible, to craft an attack that makes use of this flaw in a way that could not already be achieved by supplying an incorrect value for `Content-Length`. Vulnerabilities may exist in user-code that make incorrect assumptions about the potential accuracy of this value compared to the actual length of the data supplied. Node.js users crafting lower-level HTTP utilities are advised to re-check the length of any input supplied after parsing is complete.

This change is a *"breaking change"* as `Content-Length` values containing internal spaces are now rejected in the same way that non-numeric values are rejected. However, as per the [Node.js release plan](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-plan), we are including this as a security fix on all release lines as a **semver-minor** rather than semver-major increment.

This flaw was reported by Сковорода Никита Андреевич (Nikita Skovoroda / [@ChALkeR](https://github.com/chalker))

## [Update root certificates](#update-root-certificates)

All releases also include an update to the root certificates that are bundled in the Node.js binary. This includes 8 new additional certificates and the removal of 30 certificates. Details are available in on the public Node.js repository at <https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/19322>.

Node.js uses Mozilla's [NSS](https://wiki.mozilla.org/NSS) root certificate database. Certificates are regularly added to and removed from this database. Occasionally, certificates are revoked due to compliance or trust concerns, as is the case for the [WoSign / StartCom](https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA%3AWoSign_Issues) certificates that are being removed in this update.

Please note that the [`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v4.x/api/cli.html#cli_node_extra_ca_certs_file) environment variable may be used to add back in certificates that have been removed if required (although this is not advised). In addition the `ca` option may be used when creating TLS or HTTPS servers to provide a custom list of trusted certificates.

This update was submitted by Ben Noordhuis.

## [Summary](#summary-1)

The Node.js project will be releasing new versions for each of its supported release lines on, or shortly after, the 27th of March, 2018 (UTC). These releases will incorporate a number of security fixes and will also likely include an upgraded version of OpenSSL.

## [Inclusions](#inclusions)

### [OpenSSL 1.0.2o](#openssl-102o-1)

The OpenSSL team [have announced](https://mta.openssl.org/pipermail/openssl-announce/2018-March/000116.html) that OpenSSL 1.0.2o will be made available on the 27th of March, 2018. The highest severity issue fixed in these releases is MODERATE. According to the [OpenSSL Security Policy](https://www.openssl.org/policies/secpolicy.html), this classification is defined as follows:

> MODERATE Severity. This includes issues like crashes in client applications, flaws in protocols that are less commonly used (such as DTLS), and local flaws. These will in general be kept private until the next release, and that release will be scheduled so that it can roll up several such flaws at one time.

This post will be updated with a Node.js impact assessment for the flaws addressed in this OpenSSL release. However, regardless of severity, all actively supported Node.js release lines will likely receive an upgrade from OpenSSL 1.0.2n to 1.0.2o.

**Impact:**

* All versions of Node.js 4.x (LTS "Argon") **are** impacted
* All versions of Node.js 6.x (LTS "Boron") **are** impacted
* All versions of Node.js 8.x (LTS "Carbon") **are** impacted
* All versions of Node.js 9.x (Current) **are** impacted

### [Denial of service (DoS) vulnerability](#denial-of-service-dos-vulnerability)

All versions of 4.x are vulnerable to a flaw that can be used by an external attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS). The severity of this vulnerability is HIGH, users of the impacted versions should plan to upgrade when a fix is made available.

**Impact:**

* All versions of Node.js 4.x (LTS "Argon") **are** vulnerable
* All versions of Node.js 6.x (LTS "Boron") **are NOT** vulnerable
* All versions of Node.js 8.x (LTS "Carbon") **are NOT** vulnerable
* All versions of Node.js 9.x (Current) **are NOT** vulnerable

### [HTTP parsing flaw](#http-parsing-flaw)

All versions of Node.js contain a flaw in their HTTP parser whereby a malformed HTTP request may be misinterpreted. The security impact of this flaw is minimal and therefore the severity is VERY LOW. The impact relates to usability concerns but we are currently not aware of practical uses of this flaw to attack well-constructed HTTP servers.

**Impact:**

* All versions of Node.js 4.x (LTS "Argon") **are** vulnerable
* All versions of Node.js 6.x (LTS "Boron") **are** vulnerable
* All versions of Node.js 8.x (LTS "Carbon") **are** vulnerable
* All versions of Node.js 9.x (Current) **are** vulnerable

### [Update root certificates](#update-root-certificates-1)

All releases will also include an update to the root certificates that are bundled in the Node.js binary. This includes 5 new additional certificates and the removal of 30 certificates. Details are available in on the public Node.js repository at <https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/19322>.

Please note that the [`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v4.x/api/cli.html#cli_node_extra_ca_certs_file) environment variable may be used to add back in certificates that have been removed if required (although this is not advised). In addition, the `ca` option may be used when creating TLS or HTTPS servers to provide a custom list of trusted certificates.

## [Regarding Node.js 4.x (LTS "Argon")](#regarding-nodejs-4x-lts-argon)

Please be aware that according to the Node.js [release schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule), support for Node.js 4.x (LTS "Argon") will cease on the 30th of April. As this release line is in "Maintenance" and therefore receives minimal updates, this upcoming release of Node.js 4.x may be the final version for that release line.

If you have not already migrated from Node.js 4.x to a later release line, please do so at your earliest convenience. The Node.js team recommends adopting either Node.js 6.x (LTS "Boron") or Node.js 8.x (LTS "Carbon").

## [Release timing](#release-timing)

Releases will be available at, or shortly after, the 27th of March, 2018 (UTC), along with disclosure of the details for the flaws addressed in each release in order to allow for complete impact assessment by users.
