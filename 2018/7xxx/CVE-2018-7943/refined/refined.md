- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient authentication in some Huawei servers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authentication bypass vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A low-privilege attacker can bypass authentication, gain sensitive information, and escalate to high-level user privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attacker with low privilege can bypass the authentication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have login access to the target device. They must then use some unspecified special operations to bypass authentication.
