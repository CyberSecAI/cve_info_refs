| Type? | bug fix |
| Category? | CO |
| BC breaks? | no |
| Deprecations? | no |
| Fixed ticket? | <http://forge.prestashop.com/browse/BOOM-4917> |

| Yes, I think that's what [@eternoendless](https://github.com/eternoendless) suggested, it should be configurable it the BO Maybe the default value would be to block any frame, but this could be overriden by a specified allowed domain I lack knowledge about the addons platform actually, so I am not totally sure |

This should be surrounded by `<IfModule mod_headers.c>`, which already exist in this .htaccess.

Please move these lines further in the method, as all environment does not have the "header" module enabled (for instance, the docker images).

Sorry, something went wrong.

### **[molearnik](/molearnik)** commented [Dec 17, 2018](#issuecomment-447808476) • edited Loading

| I'd strongly recommend to think about adding "Security Enhancements" link to e.g. BO/Configure/Advanced Parameters/Security Enhancements where Administrator could enable HTTP response headers like:  ``` X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff  X-XSS-Protection: "1; mode=block"  Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"  Cache-Control: no-cache='set-cookie'  ```  Vulnerability scanners complain about omission of these headers by default. Sure, PrestaShop Administrators could do that by tweaking their web servers configurations. However,   1. That requires some technical knowledge and it is less convenient 2. .htaccess mechanism is not recommended for performance reasons ([https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/likeapache-htaccess/#](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/likeapache-htaccess/))    **Q: Would it be possible to add these headers via PrestaShop hooks like actionOutputHTMLBefore?** 3. Adding these optional headers from PrestaShop code would be cleaner and web server agnostic. 4. You could turn this into advantage over competition. 5. You could add additional security enhancement to the prestashop pages e.g. this script fragment:    <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Clickjacking_Defense_Cheat_Sheet#Best-for-now_Legacy_Browser_Frame_Breaking_Script>   Regarding demonstrating AddOns: PrestaShop websites used for demonstration purposes could have some security options disabled (should the "X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN" break the demo). |

| [@PierreRambaud](https://github.com/PierreRambaud) I think we should update this PR in the scope of our security reinforcement for PrestaShop  Woot didn't see this notification. I'm not sure it should be handle by PrestaShop installation, but why the host configuration. Otherwise we will not be able to use demo.prestashop.com anymore 🙄 |

| Like [I said before](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/8807#issuecomment-373039420):  Maybe we should add an option to configure the allowed domains somewhere in the BO.  I'm closing this PR out of staleness, but [@PierreRambaud](https://github.com/PierreRambaud) as [@matks](https://github.com/matks) said, this is something that could be done as a security feature. |
