The provided content discusses a pull request (PR) in the PrestaShop project aimed at preventing clickjacking attacks by disabling iframe embedding by default. While the content does not directly describe a CVE, it outlines the vulnerability and the proposed solution, along with related discussion.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:**
    *   The vulnerability stems from the fact that a PrestaShop instance can be embedded in an iframe, making it susceptible to clickjacking attacks.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **Clickjacking:** The primary vulnerability is clickjacking, where an attacker can overlay malicious content on top of a legitimate website displayed in an iframe. This allows the attacker to trick users into performing actions they did not intend.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Successful clickjacking attacks can lead to unauthorized actions performed by users on the target PrestaShop site. This could include unintended purchases, account modifications, or other malicious activities.
*  **Attack vectors:**
    *  Embedding a vulnerable PrestaShop site in an iframe on a malicious attacker-controlled website.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   An attacker needs to be able to create a web page that loads the vulnerable PrestaShop site within an iframe. They also need to be able to overlay malicious UI elements on top of the iframe.

**Proposed Solution:**

The PR proposes the following solutions to prevent clickjacking attacks.
    *   **Default iframe embedding disable:** The primary solution is to disable iframe embedding from other domains by default.
    *   **HTTP Response Headers:** Implementing  `X-Frame-Options` and `Content-Security-Policy (CSP)` headers to prevent the page from rendering in an iframe.
        * The `X-Frame-Options` header with a value of `SAMEORIGIN` would restrict the page from being framed by another website.
        * The `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP) header `frame-ancestors 'self';` would achieve a similar goal, blocking the resource from being loaded in frames from other domains.
    *   **Configuration Options:** It's suggested to add an option in the PrestaShop back office (BO) to configure allowed domains for iframe embedding. This will allow specific, trusted websites to embed the PrestaShop instance if needed.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The discussion highlights the need for a configurable solution since some legitimate use cases, such as demos on the PrestaShop Addons marketplace, rely on iframe embedding.
*   The use of `.htaccess` to set these headers might not be ideal due to performance considerations, therefore the implementation of this through the application logic is recommended.
*   The PR was eventually closed due to staleness, with the suggestion to revisit the implementation as a security feature.
