- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `/report_viewer.do` endpoint is vulnerable to Glide script injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input in the `sysparm_media` parameter, allowing the injection of arbitrary Glide code.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary Glide code, leading to privilege escalation, data manipulation, or other malicious activities. The provided example demonstrates how an authenticated user can escalate their privileges to the 'admin' role.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending a crafted HTTP request to the `/report_viewer.do` endpoint, including a payload of the form `${xyz}` in the `sysparm_media` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with a valid report ID on the ServiceNow platform.
