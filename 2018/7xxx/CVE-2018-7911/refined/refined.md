- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is a Factory Reset Protection (FRP) bypass issue that occurs during the re-configuration of a Huawei smart phone after a factory reset.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is that an attacker can use Gaode Map to access the configuration flow, allowing them to update the Google account associated with the device. This bypasses the intended FRP lock mechanism.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the FRP lock, effectively gaining unauthorized access to the device, and modify phone configurations.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is physical access to the smart phone.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have physical access to the device and needs to initiate the factory reset process. They then need to use Gaode Map to bypass the FRP.
