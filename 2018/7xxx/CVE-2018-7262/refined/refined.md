{
  "CVE-2018-7262": {
    "Description": "In ceph, HTTP request headers without a \":\" character that are handled in rgw_civetweb.cc:RGW::init_env() can cause variables to be set to NULL, leading to a crash or other potentially unspecified behavior.",
    "Root cause": "Malformed HTTP requests with missing ':' in headers lead to NULL pointer dereferences.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "NULL pointer dereference",
      "Denial of service"
    ],
    "Impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can cause a crash (denial of service) of the RADOS Gateway server by sending crafted HTTP requests.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending malicious HTTP requests with malformed headers"
    ],
    "Required capabilities": "The attacker only needs network access to the Ceph Rados Gateway.",
      "Additional Details": "The vulnerability lies in the RGW::init_env() function of rgw_civetweb.cc, specifically how it handles HTTP headers lacking a colon (:). This can lead to setting header values to NULL, resulting in a crash when these values are later dereferenced. The fix involves introducing error checks to handle these cases before they reach the point of dereferencing and ensuring that frontends return errors early when malformed requests are detected."
