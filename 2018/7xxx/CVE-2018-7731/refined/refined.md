Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7731:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference in the `WEBP::VP8XChunk::VP8XChunk()` function within the `WEBP_Support.cpp` file of the exempi library. This occurs when processing a crafted WEBP file where the `bitstream` pointer, intended to point to the image data, is NULL. The code attempts to access the width and height from this `bitstream` without checking for NULL, resulting in the crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of a check for a NULL `bitstream` pointer before accessing it.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The library does not properly validate the WEBP file structure, leading to the possibility of a crafted file triggering the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a crash of the application using the exempi library when processing a malicious WEBP file. The application will terminate.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted WEBP File:** The attack vector is a specially crafted WEBP file, designed to trigger the NULL pointer dereference when processed by exempi.
- **File Processing:** The vulnerability is triggered when the application attempts to open and parse the malicious WEBP file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **File Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious WEBP file that causes the `bitstream` pointer to be NULL.
- **File Delivery:** The attacker needs to have a way to deliver the crafted WEBP file to a system where an application using the vulnerable exempi library will attempt to open and parse it. The attacker does not require any special position on the system itself.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided information indicates a fix was implemented by checking if bitstream is NULL, before attempting to dereference it.
- The vulnerability is present in exempi versions prior to the fix (2.4.5), specifically mentioned in bug reports to be in 2.4.4.
- The bug was reported by Leon and fixed by Hubert Figuiere.
- Ubuntu security notice USN-3668-1 references the vulnerability, along with several other exempi CVEs, and provides updated package versions for Ubuntu 17.10, 16.04 ESM, and 14.04 ESM.

In summary, CVE-2018-7731 is a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in the exempi library that can be triggered with a specially crafted WEBP file, leading to a denial of service.
