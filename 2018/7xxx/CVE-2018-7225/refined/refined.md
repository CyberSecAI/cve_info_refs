Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2018-7225:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `rfbProcessClientNormalMessage()` function in `rfbserver.c` of LibVNCServer does not properly sanitize the `msg.cct.length` field received from a client in the `rfbClientCutText` message.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Unchecked `malloc()` size:** The client-provided 32-bit length field (`msg.cct.length`) is directly passed to `malloc()`. This allows an attacker to request an arbitrarily large memory allocation.
*  **Use of uninitialized memory:** After `malloc()`, the code reads up to `msg.cct.length` bytes from the client. If `msg.cct.length` is greater than what is actually sent by the client, the allocated buffer is passed to the `setXCutText()` callback with potentially uninitialized memory.
*  **Integer Overflow:** The value of `msg.cct.length` is added to `sz_rfbClientCutTextMsg` (which is 8) when calling `rfbStatRecordMessageRcvd()`, which can lead to an integer overflow.
*  **Unsafe Callback:** The `setXCutText()` callback receives a potentially oversized length value which could be higher than the actually read length, causing issues with uninitialized data. Also, the provided length value might be too high for the callback to handle safely.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**
    *   A large `msg.cct.length` can force the server to allocate an enormous amount of memory leading to exhaustion and/or crash.
    *   Integer overflow in `rfbStatRecordMessageRcvd()` could also lead to a crash or unpredictable behavior.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Uninitialized memory can be passed to the  `setXCutText()` callback, potentially revealing sensitive data from the server's memory.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  While less likely, the memory corruption and buffer overflows could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code by chaining the issue with other vulnerabilities.

**Attack vectors:**

*   A malicious VNC client can send a crafted `rfbClientCutText` message to the vulnerable server with an excessively large or manipulated `msg.cct.length` field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must be able to establish a connection to the vulnerable VNC server. No authentication is explicitly required to trigger the vulnerability, although some VNC servers may require it.

**Additional Details**

*   The vulnerability is present in `libvncserver/rfbserver.c` in the `rfbProcessClientNormalMessage()` function in the `rfbClientCutText` case.
*   The issue was initially discovered during an audit of Virtuozzo 7, which included a vulnerable version of LibVNCServer.
