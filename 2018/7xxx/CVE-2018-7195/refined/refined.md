The provided content is related to CVE-2018-7195.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability of a "guest" user, who logs in using an email address and a ticket number, to perform actions beyond the scope of the initial ticket. Specifically, they can create new tickets and, critically, modify personal information on the `profile.php` page, including the account's email address, without requiring a password or any form of verification.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure guest session functionality allowing unauthorized actions
- Lack of input validation/authorization on the profile update page for guest users
- Lack of email verification/password requirement when changing the email address associated with an account

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can take over a victim's account. After changing the account's email address to one they control, they can use the "Forgot My Password" function to reset the password and gain full access to the account.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to know the victim's email address. In a corporate environment, this may be easy to determine.
- The attacker needs a ticket number associated with the victim's account, which can be obtained through brute-forcing since default ticket numbers are 6-digit random numbers.
- The attacker then initiates a guest login using the email and ticket number, then changes the email address through `profile.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to know the victim's email address.
- The attacker needs to have a valid ticket number associated with the victim's account.
- The attacker must be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable osTicket installation.
