Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-7422:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a Local File Inclusion (LFI) flaw in the `Site Editor` WordPress plugin.
*   The `ajax_path` parameter, used in the `ajax_shortcode_pattern.php` file, is not properly sanitized before being used in a `require_once()` function. This allows an attacker to control the path of the file being included.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is LFI, where an attacker can include and execute arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `ajax_path` parameter is not validated or sanitized before being used in `require_once()`.
*   **Direct Use of User Input:** User-supplied data (`$_REQUEST['ajax_path']`) is directly used in a file inclusion function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, such as configuration files, database credentials, or even source code. This could lead to further compromise.
*   **Potential for Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, including PHP files might lead to code execution if a suitable file is found.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `ajax_shortcode_pattern.php` file.
*   **`ajax_path` Parameter:** The attacker controls the `ajax_path` parameter in the URL, providing a path to a file on the server they wish to access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely, meaning they don't need local access to the server.
*   **Knowledge of Plugin Path:** The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable PHP file (`/wp-content/plugins/site-editor/editor/extensions/pagebuilder/includes/ajax_shortcode_pattern.php`).
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to construct HTTP GET requests.

**Technical Details**

*   The vulnerable code snippet is located in  `site-editor/editor/extensions/pagebuilder/includes/ajax_shortcode_pattern.php` at line 5.
*   The code directly includes a file using `require_once`, based on the unsanitized user provided `ajax_path`.

```php
if( isset( $_REQUEST['ajax_path'] ) && is_file( $_REQUEST['ajax_path'] ) && file_exists( $_REQUEST['ajax_path'] ) ){
    require_once $_REQUEST['ajax_path'];
}
```

**Proof of Concept:**
A sample vulnerable request:
`http://<host>/wp-content/plugins/site-editor/editor/extensions/pagebuilder/includes/ajax_shortcode_pattern.php?ajax_path=/etc/passwd`

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Nicolas Buzy-Debat from Orange Cyberdefense Singapore (CERT-LEXSI).
*   The plugin has been closed on March 27, 2018, due to this security issue and is no longer available for download from the WordPress plugin directory.
*   No fix was available at the time of disclosure.
