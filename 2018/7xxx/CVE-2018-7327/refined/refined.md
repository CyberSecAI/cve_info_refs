Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7327:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the OpenFlow dissector, specifically in the `dissect_openflow_bundle_control_v6` function, which can lead to an infinite loop. This is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities involving large or infinite loops in multiple dissectors.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Infinite Loop:** The dissector can enter an infinite loop when processing malformed packets, leading to excessive CPU consumption.
- **Vulnerable Dissectors:** Multiple dissectors, including the OpenFlow dissector, were affected due to similar issues, specifically ASN.1 BER dissectors, along with the DICOM, DMP, LLTD, OpenFlow, RELOAD, RPCoRDMA, RPKI-Router, S7COMM, SCCP, Thread, Thrift, USB, and WCCP dissectors.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation of the vulnerability leads to excessive CPU consumption, which can render the Wireshark application unresponsive or cause it to crash, effectively causing a denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malformed Packets:** The vulnerability can be triggered by injecting malformed OpenFlow packets onto the network.
- **Malformed Packet Trace Files:** The vulnerability can also be triggered by convincing a user to open a malformed packet trace file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Packet Injection:** An attacker needs to be able to inject malformed packets into the network being monitored by Wireshark.
- **Social Engineering:** An attacker could also trick a user into opening a malicious packet trace file.
