{
  "CVE-2018-7185": {
    "root_cause": "NTP incorrectly handles certain zero-origin timestamps.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Incorrect handling of zero-origin timestamps"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by disrupting time synchronization.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a packet with a zero-origin timestamp from the 'other side' of an interleaved association."
    ],
     "required_capabilities": [
       "Remote attacker",
        "Ability to spoof source IP address"
    ],
     "additional_details": "This vulnerability is related to how NTP handles interleaved associations. An attacker needs to continually send these packets to maintain the disruption. Affected versions include ntp-4.2.6 up to but not including ntp-4.2.8p11. Interleaved mode must be explicitly enabled in ntp versions 4.2.8p7 and later to be vulnerable."
