| [Description](#c0)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2018-03-05 09:14:41 UTC  ``` From <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1550223>:  ntpq is a monitoring and control program for ntpd. decodearr() is an internal function of ntpq that is used to -- wait for it -- decode an array in a response string when formatted data is being  displayed. This is a problem in affected versions of ntpq if a maliciously-altered ntpd returns an array result that will trip this bug, or if a bad actor is able to read an ntpq request on its way to a  remote ntpd server and forge and send a response before the remote ntpd sends its response. It's potentially possible that the malicious data could become injectable/executable code.  References:  <http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/NtpBug3414>   From <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1550220>:  The NTP Protocol allows for both non-authenticated and authenticated associations, in client/server, symmetric (peer), and several broadcast modes. In addition to the basic NTP operational modes,  symmetric mode and broadcast servers can support an interleaved mode of operation. In ntp-4.2.8p4 a bug was inadvertently introduced into the protocol engine that allows a non-authenticated zero-origin  (reset) packet to reset an authenticated interleaved peer association. If an attacker can send a packet with a zero-origin timestamp and the source IP address of the "other side" of an interleaved  association, the 'victim' ntpd will reset its association. The attacker must continue sending these packets in order to maintain the disruption of the association. In ntp-4.0.0 thru ntp-4.2.8p6,  interleave mode could be entered dynamically. As of ntp-4.2.8p7, interleaved mode must be explicitly configured/enabled.  References:  <http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/NtpBug3454>   From <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1550218>:  The fix for NtpBug2952 was incomplete, and while it fixed one problem it created another. Specifically, it drops bad packets before updating the "received" timestamp. This means a third-party can inject  a packet with a zero-origin timestamp, meaning the sender wants to reset the association, and the transmit timestamp in this bogus packet will be saved as the most recent "received" timestamp. The real  remote peer does not know this value and this will disrupt the association until the association resets.  References:  <http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/NtpBug3453>   From <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1550214>:  ntpd can be vulnerable to Sybil attacks. If a system is set up to use a trustedkey and if one is not using the feature introduced in ntp-4.2.8p6 allowing an optional 4th field in the ntp.keys file to  specify which IPs can serve time, a malicious authenticated peer -- i.e. one where the attacker knows the private symmetric key -- can create arbitrarily-many ephemeral associations in order to win the  clock selection of ntpd and modify a victim's clock.  Ps.: This is possibly a incomplete fix for CVE-2016-1549.  References:  <http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/NtpBug3415>   From <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1550208>:  ctl_getitem() is used by ntpd to process incoming mode 6 packets. A malicious mode 6 packet can be sent to an ntpd instance, and if the ntpd instance is from 4.2.8p6 thru 4.2.8p10, that will cause  ctl_getitem() to read past the end of its buffer.  References:  <http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/NtpBug3412>   @maintainer(s): since the fixed package is already in the tree, please let us know if it is ready for the stabilization or not. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Thomas Deutschmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2018-03-13 18:27:14 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 650016](show_bug.cgi?id=650016 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - net-misc/ntp: Arbitrary code execution via ntpq query") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Thomas Deutschmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2018-03-13 18:31:33 UTC  ``` @ Arches,  please test and mark stable: =net-misc/ntp-4.2.8_p11 ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  GLSAMaker/CVETool Bot   gentoo-dev  2018-03-13 18:33:24 UTC  ``` CVE-2018-7185 (<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-7185>):   The protocol engine in ntp 4.2.6 before 4.2.8p11 allows a remote attackers   to cause a denial of service (disruption) by continually sending a packet   with a zero-origin timestamp and source IP address of the "other side" of an   interleaved association causing the victim ntpd to reset its association.  CVE-2018-7184 (<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-7184>):   ntpd in ntp 4.2.8p4 before 4.2.8p11 drops bad packets before updating the   "received" timestamp, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of   service (disruption) by sending a packet with a zero-origin timestamp   causing the association to reset and setting the contents of the packet as   the most recent timestamp. This issue is a result of an incomplete fix for   CVE-2015-7704.  CVE-2018-7182 (<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-7182>):   The ctl_getitem method in ntpd in ntp-4.2.8p6 before 4.2.8p11 allows remote   attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via a crafted   mode 6 packet with a ntpd instance from 4.2.8p6 through 4.2.8p10.  CVE-2018-7170 (<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-7170>):   ntpd in ntp 4.2.x before 4.2.8p7 and 4.3.x before 4.3.92 allows   authenticated users that know the private symmetric key to create   arbitrarily-many ephemeral associations in order to win the clock selection   of ntpd and modify a victim's clock via a Sybil attack. This issue exists   because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-1549. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Mikle Kolyada (RETIRED)   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2018-03-13 19:00:37 UTC  ``` amd64 stable ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Thomas Deutschmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2018-03-13 22:29:21 UTC  ``` x86 stable ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Sergei Trofimovich (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2018-03-14 22:15:37 UTC  ``` commit 267748ba25eb7b80df44cde7d8d07a50c4f09b83 Author: Rolf Eike Beer <eike@sf-mail.de> Date:   Wed Mar 14 08:13:27 2018 +0100      net-misc/ntp: stable 4.2.8_p11 for sparc, [bug #649612](show_bug.cgi?id=649612 "RESOLVED FIXED - <net-misc/ntp-4.2.8_p11: multiple vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-{7170,7182,7183,7184,7185})") ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Sergei Trofimovich (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2018-03-14 23:25:08 UTC  ``` ia64 stable ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Matt Turner   gentoo-dev  2018-03-17 17:46:47 UTC  ``` alpha stable ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Mart Raudsepp   gentoo-dev  2018-03-20 20:18:59 UTC  ``` arm64 does not have any ntp version stable.. ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Matt Turner   gentoo-dev  2018-03-21 22:11:25 UTC  ``` hppa stable ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Markus Meier   gentoo-dev  2018-04-08 10:54:35 UTC  ``` arm stable ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Mikle Kolyada (RETIRED)   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2018-05-26 08:02:10 UTC  ``` ppc/ppc64 stable, old dropped ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Aaron Bauman (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2018-05-26 14:28:43 UTC  ``` GLSA request filed ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  GLSAMaker/CVETool Bot   gentoo-dev  2018-05-26 16:02:07 UTC  ``` This issue was resolved and addressed in  GLSA 201805-12 at <https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201805-12> by GLSA coordinator Christopher Diaz Riveros (chrisadr). ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  GLSAMaker/CVETool Bot   gentoo-dev  2018-05-27 18:34:23 UTC  ``` This issue was resolved and addressed in  GLSA 201805-12 at <https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201805-12> by GLSA coordinator Aaron Bauman (b-man). ``` |  |

NTP users are strongly urged to take immediate action to ensure that their NTP daemons are not susceptible to being used in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Please also take this opportunity to defeat denial-of-service attacks by [implementing Ingress and Egress filtering through BCP38](http://www.bcp38.info/index.php/Main_Page "BCP38 Ingress/Egress filtering").

`ntp-4.2.8p18` was released on 25 May 2024 and addresses 40 bugs and provides 40 improvements.

Please see the [NTP 4.2.8p18 Changelog](https://www.ntp.org/support/securitynotice/4_2_8-series-changelog/#428p18 "4.2.8p18 Changelog") for details.

An off-path attacker can exploit this issue to temporarily break the association by sending the peer a spoofed unauthenticated packet. If the attacker sends the packets repeatedly, the peers will not be able to synchronize to each other.  The fix is to check authentication before setting the FLAG_XBOGUS flag. Unauthenticated packets should be ignored in an authenticated association. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=3454#c2)  Harlan Stenn    2018-02-03 09:38:33 UTC  ``` STAGED for 4.2.8p11 ``` |  |

FreeBSD-SA-18:02.ntp Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: Multiple vulnerabilities of ntp
Category: contrib
Module: ntp
Announced: 2018-03-07
Credits: Network Time Foundation
Affects: All supported versions of FreeBSD.
Corrected: 2018-02-28 09:01:03 UTC (stable/11, 11.1-STABLE)
2018-03-07 05:58:24 UTC (releng/11.1, 11.1-RELEASE-p7)

CVE Name: CVE-2018-7182, CVE-2018-7170, CVE-2018-7184, CVE-2018-7185,
CVE-2018-7183
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
The ntpd(8) daemon is an implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP)
used to synchronize the time of a computer system to a reference time
source.
II. Problem Description
The ctl\_getitem() function is used by ntpd(8) to process incoming "mode 6"
packets. A malicious "mode 6" packet can be sent to an ntpd instance, and
if the ntpd instance is from 4.2.8p6 through 4.2.8p10, ctl\_getitem() will
read past the end of its buffer. [CVE-2018-7182]
The ntpd(8) service can be vulnerable to Sybil attacks. If a system is
configured to use a trustedkey and if one is not using the feature introduced
in ntp-4.2.8p6 allowing an optional 4th field in the ntp.keys file to specify
which IPs can serve time, a malicious authenticated peer, i.e., one where the
attacker knows the private symmetric key, can create arbitrarily-many
ephemeral associations in order to win the clock selection of ntpd and modify
a victim's clock. [CVE-2018-7170]
The fix for NtpBug2952 was incomplete, and while it fixed one problem it
created another. Specifically, it drops bad packets before updating the
"received" timestamp. This means a third-party can inject a packet with
a zero-origin timestamp, meaning the sender wants to reset the association,
and the transmit timestamp in this bogus packet will be saved as the most
recent "received" timestamp. The real remote peer does not know this
value and this will disrupt the association until the association resets.
[CVE-2018-7184]
The NTP Protocol allows for both non-authenticated and authenticated
associations, in client/server, symmetric (peer), and several broadcast
modes. In addition to the basic NTP operational modes, symmetric mode and
broadcast servers can support an interleaved mode of operation. In
ntp-4.2.8p4, a bug was inadvertently introduced into the protocol engine that
allows a non-authenticated zero-origin (reset) packet to reset an
authenticated interleaved peer association. If an attacker can send a packet
with a zero-origin timestamp and the source IP address of the "other side" of
an interleaved association, the 'victim' ntpd will reset its association.
The attacker must continue sending these packets in order to maintain the
disruption of the association. [CVE-2018-7185]
The ntpq(8) utility is a monitoring and control program for ntpd. The
internal decodearr() function of ntpq(8) that is used to decode an array in
a response string when formatted data is being displayed. This is a problem
in affected versions of ntpq if a maliciously-altered ntpd returns an array
result that will trip this bug, or if a bad actor is able to read an ntpq(8)
request on its way to a remote ntpd server and forge and send a response
before the remote ntpd sends its response. It is potentially possible that
the malicious data could become injectable/executable code. [CVE-2017-7183]
III. Impact
Malicious remote attackers may be able to break time synchornization,
or cause the ntpq(8) utility to crash.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available, but systems not running ntpd(8) or ntpq(8) are
not affected. Network administrators are advised to implement BCP-38 which
helps to reduce risk associated with the attacks.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
The ntpd service has to be restarted after the update. A reboot is
recommended but not required.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
The ntpd service has to be restarted after the update. A reboot is
recommended but not required.
3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
[FreeBSD 11.1]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-18:02/ntp-11.1.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-18:02/ntp-11.1.patch.asc
# gpg --verify ntp-11.1.patch.asc
[FreeBSD 10.4]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-18:02/ntp-10.4.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-18:02/ntp-10.4.patch.asc
# gpg --verify ntp-10.4.patch.asc
[FreeBSD 10.3]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-18:02/ntp-10.3.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-18:02/ntp-10.3.patch.asc
# gpg --verify ntp-10.3.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in .
Restart the applicable daemons, or reboot the system.

#### Description

The NTP Protocol allows for both non-authenticated and authenticated associations, in client/server, symmetric (peer), and several broadcast modes. In addition to the basic NTP operational modes, symmetric mode and broadcast servers can support an interleaved mode of operation. In ntp-4.2.8p4 a bug was inadvertently introduced into the protocol engine that allows a non-authenticated zero-origin (reset) packet to reset an authenticated interleaved peer association. If an attacker can send a packet with a zero-origin timestamp and the source IP address of the “other side” of an interleaved association, the ‘victim’ `ntpd` will reset its association. The attacker must continue sending these packets in order to maintain the disruption of the association. In ntp-4.0.0 thru ntp-4.2.8p6, interleave mode could be entered dynamically. As of ntp-4.2.8p7, interleaved mode must be explicitly configured/enabled.

---

#### Mitigation

* Implement [BCP-38](http://www.bcp38.info/index.php/Main_Page).
* Upgrade to [4.2.8p11 or later](https://downloads.nwtime.org/ntp/4.2.8/).
* If you are unable to upgrade to 4.2.8p11 or later and have `peer HOST xleave` lines in your `ntp.conf` file, remove the `xleave` option.
* Have enough sources of time.
* Properly monitor your `ntpd` instances.
* If `ntpd` stops running, auto-restart it without `-g`.
