Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2018-7033:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Incomplete sanitization of user-provided text strings within the `accounting_storage/mysql` plugin of Slurm's `slurmdbd` component. This lack of proper sanitization allows for the possibility of SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the vulnerability to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Loss of Accounting Data:** Successful exploitation could lead to the corruption or loss of accounting data stored by Slurm.
- **Escalation of User Privileges:** The vulnerability could potentially allow an attacker to escalate their privileges on the cluster. This means an attacker could gain administrative control or access to unauthorized resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is located within the `accounting_storage/mysql` plugin, specifically related to how user-provided text strings are handled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide input that is passed to the `slurmdbd` via the `accounting_storage/mysql` plugin. This could potentially occur through various Slurm interfaces or by manipulating data that is ultimately processed by the plugin.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects all Slurm versions since version 1.3 where the `slurmdbd` component was introduced, up to the currently supported stable releases (17.02 and 17.11 at the time of the report).
- The fix involves always escaping strings within the `slurmdbd` component when using the `accounting_storage/mysql` plugin.
- A mitigation, aside from updating, is to disable `slurmdbd`.
- The vulnerability was addressed in Slurm versions 17.02.10 and 17.11.5.
- Debian LTS also issued security updates for their distribution, specifically DLA 1367-1 (for Debian 7), DLA 1437-1 (for Debian 8) and DSA 4254-1 (for Debian 9) to address this issue.
