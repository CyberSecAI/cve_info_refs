# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# TLDR, Paramiko doesn't check if the client has completed the authentication step
# before allowing the client to open channels. The PoC below connects to an SFTP
# server, and lists the root directory without authenticating. Slight modification
# is required if you want to open an SSH channel.

#!/usr/bin/python

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

# Changelog

* [:release:`3.5.0 <2024-09-15>`](#id1)
* [:feature:`982`](#id3) (via [:issue:`2444`](#id5), which was a rebase of [:issue:`2157`](#id7)) Add
  support for AES-GCM encryption ciphers (128 and 256 bit variants). Thanks to
  Alex Gaynor for the report (& for cryptography review), Shen Cheng for the
  original PR, and Chris Mason for the updated PR; plus as usual to everyone
  who tested the patches and reported their results!

  This functionality has been tested in client mode against OpenSSH 9.0, 9.2,
  and 9.6, as well as against a number of proprietary appliance SSH servers.
* [🐛`-`](#id9) Check for `None` transport members inside
  ~paramiko.channel.Channel when closing the channel; this likely doesn't
  come up much in the real world, but was causing warnings in the test suite.
* [:release:`3.4.1 <2024-08-11>`](#id11)
* [:release:`3.3.2 <2024-08-11>`](#id13)
* [🐛`2419`](#id15) (fixed in [:issue:`2421`](#id17)) Massage our import of the TripleDES
  cipher to support Cryptography >=43; this should prevent
  `CryptographyDeprecationWarning` from appearing upon import. Thanks to
  Erick Alejo for the report and Bryan Banda for the patch.
* [🐛`2420`](#id19) Modify a test-harness skiptest check to work with newer versions
  of Cryptography. Props to Paul Howarth for the patch.
* [🐛`2353`](#id21) Fix a 64-bit-ism in the test suite so the tests don't encounter a
  false negative on 32-bit systems. Reported by Stanislav Levin.
* [:release:`3.4.0 <2023-12-18>`](#id23)
* [:feature:`-`](#id25) Transport grew a new `packetizer_class` kwarg for overriding
  the packet-handler class used internally. Mostly for testing, but advanced
  users may find this useful when doing deep hacks.
* [🐛`- major`](#id27) Address [CVE 2023-48795](https://terrapin-attack.com/) (aka
  the "Terrapin Attack", a vulnerability found in the SSH protocol re:
  treatment of packet sequence numbers) as follows:

  > + The vulnerability only impacts encrypt-then-MAC digest algorithms in
  >   tandem with CBC ciphers, and ChaCha20-poly1305; of these, Paramiko
  >   currently only implements `hmac-sha2-(256|512)-etm` in tandem with
  >   `AES-CBC`. If you are unable to upgrade to Paramiko versions containing
  >   the below fixes right away, you may instead use the
  >   `disabled_algorithms` connection option to disable the ETM MACs and/or
  >   the CBC ciphers (this option is present in Paramiko >=2.6).
  > + As the fix for the vulnerability requires both ends of the connection to
  >   cooperate, the below changes will only take effect when the remote end is
  >   OpenSSH >= 9.6 (or equivalent, such as Paramiko in server mode, as of
  >   this patch version) and configured to use the new "strict kex" mode.
  >   Paramiko will always attempt to use "strict kex" mode if offered by the
  >   server, unless you override this by specifying `strict_kex=False` in
  >   Transport.\_\_init\_\_.
  > + Paramiko will now raise an SSHException subclass (MessageOrderError)
  >   when protocol messages are received in unexpected order. This includes
  >   situations like receiving `MSG_DEBUG` or `MSG_IGNORE` during initial
  >   key exchange, which are no longer allowed during strict mode.
  > + Key (re)negotiation -- i.e. `MSG_NEWKEYS`, whenever it is encountered
  >   -- now resets packet sequence numbers. (This should be invisible to users
  >   during normal operation, only causing exceptions if the exploit is
  >   encountered, which will usually result in, again, MessageOrderError.)
  > + Sequence number rollover will now raise SSHException if it occurs
  >   during initial key exchange (regardless of strict mode status).

  Thanks to Fabian Bäumer, Marcus Brinkmann, and Jörg Schwenk for submitting
  details on the CVE prior to release.
* [🐛`- major`](#id29) Tweak `ext-info-(c|s)` detection during KEXINIT protocol
  phase; the original implementation made assumptions based on an OpenSSH
  implementation detail.
* [:release:`3.3.1 <2023-07-28>`](#id31)
* [🐛`-`](#id33) Cleaned up some very old root level files, mostly just to exercise
  some of our doc build and release machinery. This changelog entry
  intentionally left blank! `nothing-to-see-here-move-along.gif`
* [:release:`3.3.0 <2023-07-28>`](#id35)
* [:feature:`1907`](#id37) (solves [:issue:`1992`](#id39)) Add support and tests for `Match
  final …` (frequently used in ProxyJump configurations to exclude the jump
  host) to our [:ref:`SSH config parser <ssh-config-support>`](#id41). Patch by
  `@commonism`.
* [:feature:`2058`](#id43) (solves [:issue:`1587`](#id45) and possibly others) Add an explicit
  `max_concurrent_prefetch_requests` argument to
  paramiko.client.SSHClient.get and paramiko.client.SSHClient.getfo,
  allowing users to limit the number of concurrent requests used during
  prefetch. Patch by `@kschoelhorn`, with a test by `@bwinston-sdp`.
* [:release:`3.2.0 <2023-05-25>`](#id47)
* [🐛`- major`](#id49) Fixed a very sneaky bug found at the apparently
  rarely-traveled intersection of `RSA-SHA2` keys, certificates, SSH agents,
  and stricter-than-OpenSSH server targets. This manifested as yet another
  "well, if we turn off SHA2 at one end or another, everything works again"
  problem, for example with version 12 of the Teleport server endpoint.

  This has been fixed; Paramiko tweaked multiple aspects of how it requests
  agent signatures, and the agent appears to do the right thing now.

  Thanks to Ryan Stoner for the bug report and testing.
* [🐛`2012 major`](#id51) (also [:issue:`1961`](#id53) and countless others) The
  `server-sig-algs` and `RSA-SHA2` features added around Paramiko 2.9 or
  so, had the annoying side effect of not working with servers that don't
  support *either* of those feature sets, requiring use of
  `disabled_algorithms` to forcibly disable the SHA2 algorithms on Paramiko's
  end.

  The **experimental** ~paramiko.transport.ServiceRequestingTransport (noted
  in its own entry in this changelog) includes a fix for this issue,
  specifically by falling back to the same algorithm as the in-use pubkey if
  it's in the algorithm list (leaving the "first algorithm in said list" as an
  absolute final fallback).
* [:feature:`-`](#id55) Implement `_fields()` on ~paramiko.agent.AgentKey so that it
  may be compared (via `==`) with other ~paramiko.pkey.PKey instances.
* [🐛`23 major`](#id57) Since its inception, Paramiko has (for reasons lost to time)
  implemented authentication as a side effect of handling affirmative replies
  to `MSG_SERVICE_REQUEST` protocol messages. What this means is Paramiko
  makes one such request before every `MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST`, i.e. every auth
  attempt.

  OpenSSH doesn't care if clients send multiple service requests, but other
  server implementations are often stricter in what they accept after an
  initial service request (due to the RFCs not being clear). This can result in
  odd behavior when a user doesn't authenticate successfully on the very first
  try (for example, when the right key for a target host is the third in one's
  ssh-agent).

  This version of Paramiko now contains an opt-in
  ~paramiko.transport.Transport subclass,
  ~paramiko.transport.ServiceRequestingTransport, which more-correctly
  implements service request handling in the Transport, and uses an
  auth-handler subclass internally which has been similarly adapted. Users
  wanting to try this new experimental code path may hand this class to
  SSHClient.connect <paramiko.client.SSHClient.connect> as its
  `transport_factory` kwarg.

  Warning

  This feature is **EXPERIMENTAL** and its code may be subject to change.

  In addition:
  + minor backwards incompatible changes exist in the new code paths,
    most notably the removal of the (inconsistently applied and rarely
    used) `event` arguments to the `auth_xxx` methods.
  + GSSAPI support has only been partially implemented, and is untested.

  Note

  Some minor backwards-*compatible* changes were made to the **existing**
  Transport and AuthHandler classes to facilitate the new code. For
  example, `Transport._handler_table` and
  `AuthHandler._client_handler_table` are now properties instead of raw
  attributes.
* [:feature:`387`](#id59) Users of ~paramiko.client.SSHClient can now configure the
  authentication logic Paramiko uses when connecting to servers; this
  functionality is intended for advanced users and higher-level libraries such
  as [Fabric](https://fabfile.org). See ~paramiko.auth\_strategy for
  details.

  Fabric's co-temporal release includes a proof-of-concept use of this feature,
  implementing an auth flow much closer to that of the OpenSSH client (versus
  Paramiko's legacy behavior). It is **strongly recommended** that if this
  interests you, investigate replacing any direct use of `SSHClient` with
  Fabric's `Connection`.

  Warning

  This feature is **EXPERIMENTAL**; please see its docs for details.
* [:feature:`-`](#id61) Enhanced ~paramiko.agent.AgentKey with new attributes, such
  as:

  > + Added a `comment` attribute (and constructor argument);
  >   Agent.get\_keys() <paramiko.agent.Agent.get\_keys> now uses this kwarg to
  >   store any comment field sent over by the agent. The original version of
  >   the agent feature inexplicably did not store the comment anywhere.
  > + Agent-derived keys now attempt to instantiate a copy of the appropriate
  >   key class for access to other algorithm-specific members (eg key size).
  >   This is available as the `.inner_key` attribute.

  Note

  This functionality is now in use in Fabric's new `--list-agent-keys`
  feature, as well as in Paramiko's debug logging.
* [:feature:`-`](#id63) ~paramiko.pkey.PKey now offers convenience
  "meta-constructors", static methods that simplify the process of
  instantiating the correct subclass for a given key input.

  For example, PKey.from\_path <paramiko.pkey.PKey.from\_path> can load a file
  path without knowing *a priori* what type of key it is (thanks to some handy
  methods within our cryptography dependency). Going forwards, we expect this
  to be the primary method of loading keys by user code that runs on "human
  time" (i.e. where some minor efficiencies are worth the convenience).

  In addition, PKey.from\_type\_string <paramiko.pkey.PKey.from\_type\_string>
  now exists, and is being used in some internals to load ssh-agent keys.

  As part of these changes, ~paramiko.pkey.PKey and friends grew an
  ~paramiko.pkey.PKey.identifiers classmethod; this is inspired by the
  ~paramiko.ecdsakey.ECDSAKey.supported\_key\_format\_identifiers classmethod
  (which now refers to the new method.) This also includes adding a `.name`
  attribute to most key classes (which will eventually replace `.get_name()`.
* [:feature:`-`](#id65) ~paramiko.pkey.PKey grew a new `.algorithm_name` property
  which displays the key algorithm; this is typically derived from the value of
  ~paramiko.pkey.PKey.get\_name. For example, ED25519 keys have a `get_name`
  of `ssh-ed25519` (the SSH protocol key type field value), and now have a
  `algorithm_name` of `ED25519`.
* [:feature:`-`](#id67) ~paramiko.pkey.PKey grew a new `.fingerprint` property which
  emits a fingerprint string matching the SHA256+Base64 values printed by
  various OpenSSH tooling (eg `ssh-add -l`, `ssh -v`). This is intended to
  help troubleshoot Paramiko-vs-OpenSSH behavior and will eventually replace
  the venerable `get_fingerprint` method.
* [🐛`- major`](#id69) ~paramiko.agent.AgentKey had a dangling Python 3
  incompatible `__str__` method returning bytes. This method has been
  removed, allowing the superclass' (~paramiko.pkey.PKey) method to run
  instead.
* [:release:`3.1.0 <2023-03-10>`](#id71)
* [:feature:`2013`](#id73) (solving [:issue:`2009`](#id75), plus others) Add an explicit
  `channel_timeout` keyword argument to paramiko.client.SSHClient.connect,
  allowing users to configure the previously-hardcoded default value of 3600
  seconds. Thanks to `@VakarisZ` and `@ilija-lazoroski` for the report and
  patch, with credit to Mike Salvatore for patch review.
* [:feature:`2173`](#id77) Accept single tabs as field separators (in addition to
  single spaces) in <paramiko.hostkeys.HostKeyEntry.from\_line> for parity
  with OpenSSH's KnownHosts parser. Patched by Alex Chavkin.
* [:support:`2178 backported`](#id79) Apply `codespell` to the codebase, which found a
  lot of very old minor spelling mistakes in docstrings. Also modernize many
  instances of `*largs` vs `*args` and `**kwarg` vs `**kwargs`. Patch
  courtesy of Yaroslav Halchenko, with review from Brian Skinn.
* [:release:`3.0.0 <2023-01-20>`](#id81)
* [🐛`2110 major`](#id83) Remove some unnecessary `__repr__` calls when handling
  bytes-vs-str conversions. This was apparently doing a lot of unintentional
  data processing, which adds up in some use cases -- such as SFTP transfers,
  which may now be significantly faster. Kudos to Shuhua Zhong for catch &
  patch.
* [🐛`2165 major`](#id85) Streamline some redundant (and costly) byte conversion
  calls in the packetizer and the core SFTP module. This should lead to some
  SFTP speedups at the very least. Thanks to Alex Gaynor for the patch.
* [:support:`-`](#id87) `paramiko.util.retry_on_signal` (and any internal uses of
  same, and also any internal retries of `EINTR` on eg socket operations) has
  been removed. As of Python 3.5, per [PEP 475](https://peps.python.org/pep-0475/), this functionality (and retrying
  `EINTR` generally) is now part of the standard library.

  Warning

  This change is backwards incompatible if you were explicitly
  importing/using this particular function. The observable behavior otherwise
  should not be changing.
* [:support:`732`](#id89) (also re: [:issue:`630`](#id91)) ~paramiko.config.SSHConfig used to
  straight-up delete the `proxycommand` key from config lookup results when
  the source config said `ProxyCommand none`. This has been altered to
  preserve the key and give it the Python value `None`, thus making the
  Python representation more in line with the source config file.

  Warning

  This change is backwards incompatible if you were relying on the old (1.x,
  2.x) behavior for some reason (eg assuming all `proxycommand` values were
  valid subcommand strings).
* [:support:`-`](#id93) The behavior of private key classes' (ie anything inheriting
  from ~paramiko.pkey.PKey) private key writing methods used to perform a
  manual, extra `chmod` call after writing. This hasn't been strictly
  necessary since the mid 2.x release line (when key writing started giving the
  `mode` argument to os.open), and has now been removed entirely.

  This should only be observable if you were mocking Paramiko's system calls
  during your own testing, or similar.
* [:support:`-`](#id95) `PKey.__cmp__` has been removed. Ordering-oriented comparison
  of key files is unlikely to have ever made sense (the old implementation
  attempted to order by the hashes of the key material) and so we have not
  bothered setting up `__lt__` and friends at this time. The class continues
  to have its original `__eq__` untouched.

  Warning

  This change is backwards incompatible if you were actually trying to sort
  public key objects (directly or indirectly). Please file bug reports
  detailing your use case if you have some intractable need for this
  behavior, and we'll consider adding back the necessary Python 3 magic
  methods so that it works as before.
* [🐛`- major`](#id97) A handful of lower-level classes (notably
  paramiko.message.Message and paramiko.pkey.PKey) previously returned
  bytes objects from their implementation of `__str__`, even under Python
  3; and there was never any `__bytes__` method.

  These issues have been fixed by renaming `__str__` to `__bytes__` and
  relying on Python's default "stringification returns the output of
  `__repr__`" behavior re: any real attempts to `str()` such objects.
* [:support:`-`](#id99) `paramiko.common.asbytes` has been moved to
  `paramiko.util.asbytes`.

  Warning

  This change is backwards incompatible if you were directly using this
  function (which is unlikely).
* [:support:`-`](#id101) Remove the now irrelevant `paramiko.py3compat` module.

  Warning

  This change is backwards incompatible. Such references should be
  search-and-replaced with their modern Python 3.6+ equivalents; in some
  cases, still-useful methods or values have been moved to `paramiko.util`
  (most) or `paramiko.common` (`byte_*`).
* [:support:`-`](#id103) Drop support for Python versions less than 3.6, including Python
  2. So long and thanks for all the fish!

  Warning

  This change is backwards incompatible. However, our packaging metadata has
  been updated to include `python_requires`, so this should not cause
  breakage unless you're on an old installation method that can't read this
  metadata.

  Note

  As part of this change, our dependencies have been updated; eg we now
  require Cryptography>=3.3, up from 2.5.
* [:release:`2.12.0 <2022-11-04>`](#id105)
* [:feature:`2125`](#id107) (also re: [:issue:`2054`](#id109)) Add a `transport_factory` kwarg to
  SSHClient.connect <paramiko.client.SSHClient.connect> for advanced
  users to gain more control over early Transport setup and manipulation.
  Thanks to Noah Pederson for the patch.
* [:release:`2.11.1 <2022-11-04>`](#id111)
* [:release:`2.10.6 <2022-11-04>`](#id113)
* [🐛`1822`](#id115) (via, and relating to, far too many other issues to mention here)
  Update ~paramiko.client.SSHClient so it explicitly closes its wrapped
  socket object upon encountering socket errors at connection time. This should
  help somewhat with certain classes of memory leaks, resource warnings, and/or
  errors (though we hasten to remind everyone that Client and Transport have
  their own `.close()` methods for use in non-error situations!). Patch
  courtesy of `@YoavCohen`.
* bug:1637 (via [:issue:`1599`](#id117)) Raise ~paramiko.ssh\_exception.SSHException
  explicitly when blank private key data is loaded, instead of the natural
  result of `IndexError`. This should help more bits of Paramiko or
  Paramiko-adjacent codebases to correctly handle this class of error. Credit:
  Nicholas Dietz.
* [:release:`2.11.0 <2022-05-16>`](#id119)
* [:release:`2.10.5 <2022-05-16>`](#id121)
* [:release:`2.9.5 <2022-05-16>`](#id123)
* [🐛`1933`](#id125) Align signature verification algorithm with OpenSSH re:
  zero-padding signatures which don't match their nominal size/length. This
  shouldn't affect most users, but will help Paramiko-implemented SSH servers
  handle poorly behaved clients such as PuTTY. Thanks to Jun Omae for catch &
  patch.
* [🐛`2017`](#id127) OpenSSH 7.7 and older has a bug preventing it from understanding
  how to perform SHA2 signature verification for RSA certificates (specifically
  certs - not keys), so when we added SHA2 support it broke all clients using
  RSA certificates with these servers. This has been fixed in a manner similar
  to what OpenSSH's own client does: a version check is performed and the
  algorithm used is downgraded if needed. Reported by Adarsh Chauhan, with fix
  suggested by Jun Omae.
* [:support:`2038`](#id129) (via [:issue:`2039`](#id131)) Recent versions of Cryptography have
  deprecated Blowfish algorithm support; in lieu of an easy method for users to
  remove it from the list of algorithms Paramiko tries to import and use, we've
  decided to remove it from our "preferred algorithms" list. This will both
  discourage use of a weak algorithm, and avoid warnings. Credit for
  report/patch goes to Mike Roest.
* [🐛`2008`](#id133) (via [:issue:`2010`](#id135)) Windows-native SSH agent support as merged in
  2.10 could encounter `Errno 22` `OSError` exceptions in some scenarios
  (eg server not cleanly closing a relevant named pipe). This has been worked
  around and should be less problematic. Reported by Danilo Campana Fuchs and
  patched by Jun Omae.
* [:release:`2.10.4 <2022-04-25>`](#id137)
* [:release:`2.9.4 <2022-04-25>`](#id139)
* [:support:`1838 backported`](#id141) (via [:issue:`1870`](#id143)/[:issue:`2028`](#id145)) Update
  `camelCase` method calls against the `threading` module to be
  `snake_case`; this and related tweaks should fix some deprecation warnings
  under Python 3.10. Thanks to Karthikeyan Singaravelan for the report,
  `@Narendra-Neerukonda` for the patch, and to Thomas Grainger and Jun Omae
  for patch workshopping.
* [:feature:`1951`](#id147) Add SSH config token expansion (eg `%h`, `%p`) when
  parsing `ProxyJump` directives. Patch courtesy of Bruno Inec.
* [🐛`1964`](#id149) (via [:issue:`2024`](#id151) as also reported in [:issue:`2023`](#id153))
  ~paramiko.pkey.PKey instances' `__eq__` did not have the usual safety
  guard in place to ensure they were being compared to another `PKey` object,
  causing occasional spurious `BadHostKeyException` (among other things).
  This has been fixed. Thanks to Shengdun Hua for the original report/patch and
  to Christopher Papke for the final version of the fix.
* [:support:`2004`](#id155) (via [:issue:`2011`](#id157)) Apply unittest `skipIf` to tests
  currently using SHA1 in their critical path, to avoid failures on systems
  starting to disable SHA1 outright in their crypto backends (eg RHEL 9).
  Report & patch via Paul Howarth.
* [🐛`2035`](#id159) Servers offering certificate variants of hostkey algorithms (eg
  `ssh-rsa-cert-v01@openssh.com`) could not have their host keys verified by
  Paramiko clients, as it only ever considered non-cert key types for that part
  of connection handshaking. This has been fixed.
* [:release:`2.10.3 <2022-03-18>`](#id161)
* [:release:`2.9.3 <2022-03-18>`](#id163)
* [🐛`1963`](#id165) (via [:issue:`1977`](#id167)) Certificate-based pubkey auth was
  inadvertently broken when adding SHA2 support; this has been fixed. Reported
  by Erik Forsberg and fixed by Jun Omae.
* [🐛`2002`](#id169) (via [:issue:`2003`](#id171)) Switch from module-global to thread-local
  storage when recording thread IDs for a logging helper; this should avoid one
  flavor of memory leak for long-running processes. Catch & patch via Richard

* [:release:`2.10.2 <2022-03-14>`](#id173)
* [🐛`2001`](#id175) Fix Python 2 compatibility breakage introduced in 2.10.1. Spotted
  by Christian Hammond.

  Warning

  This is almost certainly the last time we will fix Python 2 related
  errors! Please see [the roadmap](https://bitprophet.org/projects/#roadmap).
* [:release:`2.10.1 <2022-03-11>`](#id177)
* [🐛`- (2.10+)`](#id179) ([CVE-2022-24302](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-24302)) Creation
  of new private key files using ~paramiko.pkey.PKey subclasses was subject
  to a race condition between file creation & mode modification, which could be
  exploited by an attacker with knowledge of where the Paramiko-using code
  would write out such files.

  This has been patched by using os.open and os.fdopen to ensure new files
  are opened with the correct mode immediately. We've left the subsequent
  explicit `chmod` in place to minimize any possible disruption, though it
  may get removed in future backwards-incompatible updates.

  Thanks to Jan Schejbal for the report & feedback on the solution, and to
  Jeremy Katz at Tidelift for coordinating the disclosure.
* [:release:`2.10.0 <2022-03-11>`](#id181)
* [:feature:`1976`](#id183) Add support for the `%C` token when parsing SSH config
  files. Foundational PR submitted by `@jbrand42`.
* [:feature:`1509`](#id185) (via [:issue:`1868`](#id187), [:issue:`1837`](#id189)) Add support for OpenSSH's
  Windows agent as a fallback when Putty/WinPageant isn't available or
  functional. Reported by `@benj56` with patches/PRs from `@lewgordon` and
  Patrick Spendrin.
* [🐛`892 major`](#id191) Significantly speed up low-level read/write actions on
  ~paramiko.sftp\_file.SFTPFile objects by using bytearray/memoryview.
  This is unlikely to change anything for users of the higher level methods
  like SFTPClient.get <paramiko.sftp\_client.SFTPClient.get> or
  SFTPClient.getfo <paramiko.sftp\_client.SFTPClient.getfo>, but users of
  SFTPClient.open <paramiko.sftp\_client.SFTPClient.open> will likely see
  orders of magnitude improvements for files larger than a few megabytes in
  size.

  Thanks to `@jkji` for the original report and to Sevastian Tchernov for the
  patch.
* [:support:`1985`](#id193) Add `six` explicitly to install-requires; it snuck into
  active use at some point but has only been indicated by transitive dependency
  on `bcrypt` until they somewhat-recently dropped it. This will be
  short-lived until we [drop Python 2
  support](https://bitprophet.org/projects/#roadmap). Thanks to Sondre
  Lillebø Gundersen for catch & patch.
* [:release:`2.9.2 <2022-01-08>`](#id195)
* [🐛`-`](#id197) Connecting to servers which support `server-sig-algs` but which
  have no overlap between that list and what a Paramiko client supports, now
  raise an exception instead of defaulting to `rsa-sha2-512` (since the use
  of `server-sig-algs` allows us to know what the server supports).
* [🐛`-`](#id199) Enhanced log output when connecting to servers that do not support
  `server-sig-algs` extensions, making the new-as-of-2.9 defaulting to SHA2
  pubkey algorithms more obvious when it kicks in.
* [:release:`2.9.1 <2021-12-24>`](#id201)
* [🐛`1955`](#id203) Server-side support for `rsa-sha2-256` and `ssh-rsa` wasn't
  fully operable after 2.9.0's release (signatures for RSA pubkeys were always
  run through `rsa-sha2-512` instead). Report and early stab at a fix
  courtesy of Jun Omae.
* [:release:`2.9.0 <2021-12-23>`](#id205)
* [:feature:`1643`](#id207) (also [:issue:`1925`](#id209), [:issue:`1644`](#id211), [:issue:`1326`](#id213)) Add
  support for SHA-2 variants of RSA key verification algorithms (as described
  in [RFC 8332](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8332.html)) as well as limited SSH extension negotiation ([RFC 8308](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8308.html)).

  Warning

  This change is slightly backwards incompatible, insofar as action is
  required if your target systems do not support either RSA2 or the
  `server-sig-algs` protocol extension.

  Specifically, you need to specify `disabled_algorithms={'keys':
  ['rsa-sha2-256', 'rsa-sha2-512']}` in either SSHClient
  <paramiko.client.SSHClient.\_\_init\_\_> or Transport
  <paramiko.transport.Transport.\_\_init\_\_>. See below for details on why.

  How SSH servers/clients decide when and how to use this functionality can be
  complicated; Paramiko's support is as follows:

  + Client verification of server host key during key exchange will now prefer
    `rsa-sha2-512`, `rsa-sha2-256`, and legacy `ssh-rsa` algorithms, in
    that order, instead of just `ssh-rsa`.

    > - Note that the preference order of other algorithm families such as
    >   `ed25519` and `ecdsa` has not changed; for example, those two
    >   groups are still preferred over RSA.
  + Server mode will now offer all 3 RSA algorithms for host key verification
    during key exchange, similar to client mode, if it has been configured with
    an RSA host key.
  + Client mode key exchange now sends the `ext-info-c` flag signaling
    support for `MSG_EXT_INFO`, and support for parsing the latter
    (specifically, its `server-sig-algs` flag) has been added.
  + Client mode, when performing public key authentication with an RSA key or
    cert, will act as follows:

    - In all cases, the list of algorithms to consider is based on the new
      `preferred_pubkeys` list (see below) and `disabled_algorithms`
      (specifically, its `pubkeys` key); this list, like with host keys,
      prefers SHA2-512, SHA2-256 and SHA1, in that order.
    - When the server does not send `server-sig-algs`, Paramiko will attempt
      the first algorithm in the above list. Clients connecting to legacy
      servers should thus use `disabled_algorithms` to turn off SHA2.
    - When the server does send `server-sig-algs`, the first algorithm
      supported by both ends is used, or if there is none, it falls back to the
      previous behavior.
  + SSH agent support grew the ability to specify algorithm flags when
    requesting private key signatures; this is now used to forward SHA2
    algorithms when appropriate.
  + Server mode is now capable of pubkey auth involving SHA-2 signatures from
    clients, provided one's server implementation actually provides for doing
    so.

    - This includes basic support for sending `MSG_EXT_INFO` (containing
      `server-sig-algs` only) to clients advertising `ext-info-c` in their
      key exchange list.

  In order to implement the above, the following API additions were made:

  + PKey.sign\_ssh\_data <paramiko.pkey.PKey>: Grew an extra, optional
    `algorithm` keyword argument (defaulting to `None` for most subclasses,
    and to `"ssh-rsa"` for ~paramiko.rsakey.RSAKey).
  + A new ~paramiko.ssh\_exception.SSHException subclass was added,
    ~paramiko.ssh\_exception.IncompatiblePeer, and is raised in all spots
    where key exchange aborts due to algorithmic incompatibility.
    - Like all other exceptions in that module, it inherits from
      `SSHException`, and as we did not change anything else about the
      raising (i.e. the attributes and message text are the same) this change
      is backwards compatible.
  + ~paramiko.transport.Transport grew a `_preferred_pubkeys` attribute and
    matching `preferred_pubkeys` property to match the other, kex-focused,
    such members. This allows client pubkey authentication to honor the
    `disabled_algorithms` feature.

  Thanks to Krisztián Kovács for the report and an early stab at a patch, as
  well as the numerous users who submitted feedback on the issue, including but
  not limited to: Christopher Rabotin, Sam Bull, and Manfred Kaiser.
* [:release:`2.8.1 <2021-11-28>`](#id215)
* [🐛`985`](#id217) (via [:issue:`992`](#id219)) Fix listdir failure when server uses a locale.
  Now on Python 2.7 SFTPAttributes <paramiko.sftp\_attr.SFTPAttributes> will
  decode abbreviated month names correctly rather than raise
  `UnicodeDecodeError``. Patch courtesy of Martin Packman.
* [🐛`1024`](#id221) Deleting items from ~paramiko.hostkeys.HostKeys would
  incorrectly raise KeyError even for valid keys, due to a logic bug. This
  has been fixed. Report & patch credit: Jia Zhang.
* [🐛`1257`](#id223) (also [:issue:`1266`](#id225)) Update RSA and ECDSA key decoding
  subroutines to correctly catch exception types thrown by modern
  versions of Cryptography (specifically `TypeError` and
  its internal `UnsupportedAlgorithm`). These exception classes will now
  become ~paramiko.ssh\_exception.SSHException instances instead of bubbling
  up. Thanks to Ignat Semenov for the report and `@tylergarcianet` for an
  early patch.
* [🐛`-`](#id227) (also [:issue:`908`](#id229)) Update ~paramiko.pkey.PKey and subclasses to
  compare (`__eq__`) via direct field/attribute comparison instead of hashing
  (while retaining the existing behavior of `__hash__` via a slight
  refactor). Big thanks to Josh Snyder and Jun Omae for the reports, and to
  Josh Snyder for reproduction details & patch.

  Warning

  This fixes a security flaw! If you are running Paramiko on 32-bit systems
  with low entropy (such as any 32-bit Python 2, or a 32-bit Python 3 which
  is running with `PYTHONHASHSEED=0`) it is possible for an attacker to
  craft a new keypair from an exfiltrated public key, which Paramiko would
  consider equal to the original key.

  This could enable attacks such as, but not limited to, the following:

  + Paramiko server processes would incorrectly authenticate the attacker
    (using their generated private key) as if they were the victim. We see
    this as the most plausible attack using this flaw.
  + Paramiko client processes would incorrectly validate a connected server
    (when host key verification is enabled) while subjected
    to a man-in-the-middle attack. This impacts more users than the
    server-side version, but also carries higher requirements for the
    attacker, namely successful DNS poisoning or other MITM techniques.
* [:release:`2.8.0 <2021-10-09>`](#id231)
* [:support:`-`](#id233) Administrivia overhaul, including but not limited to:

  + Migrate CI to CircleCI
  + Primary dev branch is now `main` (renamed)
  + Many README edits for clarity, modernization etc; including a bunch more
    (and consistent) status badges & unification with main project site index
  + PyPI page much more fleshed out (long\_description is now filled in with the
    README; sidebar links expanded; etc)
  + flake8, pytest configs split out of setup.cfg into their own files
  + Invoke/invocations (used by maintainers/contributors) upgraded to modern
    versions
* [🐛`1462 major`](#id235) (via [:issue:`1882`](#id237)) Newer server-side key exchange
  algorithms not intended to use SHA1 (`diffie-hellman-group14-sha256`,
  `diffie-hellman-group16-sha512`) were incorrectly using SHA1 after all, due
  to a bug causing them to ignore the `hash_algo` class attribute. This has
  been corrected. Big thanks to `@miverson` for the report and to Benno Rice
  for the patch.
* [:feature:`1846`](#id239) Add a `prefetch` keyword argument to SFTPClient.get <paramiko.sftp\_client.SFTPClient.get>/SFTPClient.getfo <paramiko.sftp\_client.SFTPClient.getfo>
  so users who need to skip SFTP prefetching are able to conditionally turn it
  off. Thanks to Github user `@h3ll0r` for the PR.
* [:release:`2.7.2 <2020-08-30>`](#id241)
* [:support:`- backported`](#id243) Update our CI to catch issues with sdist generation,
  installation and testing.
* [:support:`1727 backported`](#id245) Add missing test suite fixtures directory to
  MANIFEST.in, reinstating the ability to run Paramiko's tests from an sdist
  tarball. Thanks to Sandro Tosi for reporting the issue and to Blazej Michalik
  for the PR.
* [:support:`1722 backported`](#id247) Remove leading whitespace from OpenSSH RSA test
  suite static key fixture, to conform better to spec. Credit: Alex Gaynor.
* [🐛`-`](#id249) Fix incorrect string formatting causing unhelpful error message
  annotation when using Kerberos/GSSAPI. (Thanks, newer version of flake8!)
* [🐛`1723`](#id251) Fix incorrectly swapped order of `p` and `q` numbers when
  loading OpenSSH-format RSA private keys. At minimum this should address a
  slowdown when using such keys, and it also means Paramiko works with
  Cryptography 3.1 and above (which complains strenuously when this problem
  appears). Thanks to Alex Gaynor for the patch.
* [:release:`2.7.1 <2019-12-09>`](#id253)
* [🐛`1567`](#id255) The new-style private key format (added in 2.7) suffered from an
  unpadding bug which had been fixed earlier for Ed25519 (as that key type has
  always used the newer format). That fix has been refactored and applied to
  the base key class, courtesy of Pierce Lopez.
* [🐛`1565`](#id257) (via [:issue:`1566`](#id259)) Fix a bug in support for ECDSA keys under the
  newly supported OpenSSH key format. Thanks to Pierce Lopez for the patch.
* [:release:`2.7.0 <2019-12-03>`](#id261)
* [:feature:`602`](#id263) (via [:issue:`1343`](#id265), [:issue:`1313`](#id267), [:issue:`618`](#id269)) Implement
  support for OpenSSH 6.5-style private key files (typically denoted as having
  `BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY` headers instead of PEM format's `BEGIN RSA
  PRIVATE KEY` or similar). If you were getting any sort of weird auth error
  from "modern" keys generated on newer operating system releases (such as
  macOS Mojave), this is the first update to try.

  Major thanks to everyone who contributed or tested versions of the patch,
  including but not limited to: Kevin Abel, Michiel Tiller, Pierce Lopez, and
  Jared Hobbs.
* [🐛`- major`](#id271) `ssh_config` [:ref:`token expansion <TOKENS>`](#id273) used a
  different method of determining the local username (`$USER` env var),
  compared to what the (much older) client connection code does
  (`getpass.getuser`, which includes `$USER` but may check other variables
  first, and is generally much more comprehensive). Both modules now use
  `getpass.getuser`.
* [:feature:`-`](#id275) A couple of outright ~paramiko.config.SSHConfig parse errors
  were previously represented as vanilla `Exception` instances; as part of
  recent feature work a more specific exception class,
  ~paramiko.ssh\_exception.ConfigParseError, has been created. It is now also
  used in those older spots, which is naturally backwards compatible.
* [:feature:`717`](#id277) Implement support for the `Match` keyword in `ssh_config`
  files. Previously, this keyword was simply ignored & keywords inside such
  blocks were treated as if they were part of the previous block. Thanks to
  Michael Leinartas for the initial patchset.

  Note

  This feature adds a new [:doc:`optional install dependency </installing>`](#id279),
  [Invoke](https://www.pyinvoke.org), for managing `Match exec`
  subprocesses.
* [:support:`-`](#id281) Additional [:doc:`installation </installing>`](#id283) `extras_require`
  "flavors" (`ed25519`, `invoke`, and `all`) have been added to
  our packaging metadata; see the install docs for details.
* [🐛`- major`](#id285) Paramiko's use of `subprocess` for `ProxyCommand` support
  is conditionally imported to prevent issues on limited interpreter platforms
  like Google Compute Engine. However, any resulting `ImportError` was lost
  instead of preserved for raising (in the rare cases where a user tried
  leveraging `ProxyCommand` in such an environment). This has been fixed.
* [🐛`- major`](#id287) Perform deduplication of `IdentityFile` contents during
  `ssh_config` parsing; previously, if your config would result in the same
  value being encountered more than once, `IdentityFile` would contain that
  many copies of the same string.
* [:feature:`897`](#id289) Implement most 'canonical hostname' `ssh_config`
  functionality (`CanonicalizeHostname`, `CanonicalDomains`,
  `CanonicalizeFallbackLocal`, and `CanonicalizeMaxDots`;
  `CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs` has **not** yet been implemented). All were
  previously silently ignored. Reported by Michael Leinartas.
* [:support:`-`](#id291) Explicitly document [:ref:`which ssh\_config features we
  currently support <ssh-config-support>`](#id293). Previously users just had to guess,
  which is simply no good.
* [:feature:`-`](#id295) Add new convenience classmethod constructors to
  ~paramiko.config.SSHConfig: ~paramiko.config.SSHConfig.from\_text,
  ~paramiko.config.SSHConfig.from\_file, and
  ~paramiko.config.SSHConfig.from\_path. No more annoying two-step process!
* [:release:`2.6.0 <2019-06-23>`](#id297)
* [:feature:`1463`](#id299) Add a new keyword argument to SSHClient.connect
  <paramiko.client.SSHClient.connect> and ~paramiko.transport.Transport,
  `disabled_algorithms`, which allows selectively disabling one or more
  kex/key/cipher/etc algorithms. This can be useful when disabling algorithms
  your target server (or client) does not support cleanly, or to work around
  unpatched bugs in Paramiko's own implementation thereof.
* [:release:`2.5.1 <2019-06-23>`](#id301)
* [:release:`2.4.3 <2019-06-23>`](#id303)
* [🐛`1306`](#id305) (via [:issue:`1400`](#id307)) Fix Ed25519 key handling so certain key
  comment lengths don't cause `SSHException("Invalid key")` (this was
  technically a bug in how padding, or lack thereof, is
  calculated/interpreted). Thanks to `@parke` for the bug report & Pierce
  Lopez for the patch.
* [:support:`1440`](#id309) (with initial fixes via [:issue:`1460`](#id311)) Tweak many exception
  classes so their string representations are more human-friendly; this also
  includes incidental changes to some `super()` calls.

  The definitions of exceptions' `__init__` methods have *not* changed, nor
  have any log messages been altered, so this should be backwards compatible
  for everything except the actual exceptions' `__str__()` outputs.

  Thanks to Fabian Büchler for original report & Pierce Lopez for the
  foundational patch.
* [:support:`1311`](#id313) (for [:issue:`584`](#id315), replacing [:issue:`1166`](#id317)) Add
  backwards-compatible support for the `gssapi` GSSAPI library, as the
  previous backend (`python-gssapi`) has since become defunct. This change
  also includes tests for the GSSAPI functionality.

  Big thanks to Anselm Kruis for the patch and to Sebastian Deiß (author of our
  initial GSSAPI functionality) for review.

  Note

  This feature also adds `setup.py` 'extras' support for installing
  Paramiko as `paramiko[gssapi]`, which pulls in the optional
  dependencies you had to get by hand previously.

  Note

  To be very clear, this patch **does not** remove support for the older
  `python-gssapi` library. We *may* remove that support in a later release,
  but for now, either library will work. Please upgrade to `gssapi` when
  you can, however, as `python-gssapi` is no longer maintained upstream.
* [🐛`322 major`](#id319) SSHClient.exec\_command
  <paramiko.client.SSHClient.exec\_command> previously returned a naive
  ~paramiko.channel.ChannelFile object for its `stdin` value; such objects
  don't know to properly shut down the remote end's stdin when they
  `.close()`. This lead to issues (such as hangs) when running remote
  commands that read from stdin.

  A new subclass, ~paramiko.channel.ChannelStdinFile, has been created which
  closes remote stdin when it itself is closed.
  ~paramiko.client.SSHClient.exec\_command has been updated to use that class
  for its `stdin` return value.

  Thanks to Brandon Rhodes for the report & steps to reproduce.
* [:release:`2.5.0 <2019-06-09>`](#id321)
* [:feature:`1233`](#id323) (also [:issue:`1229`](#id325), [:issue:`1332`](#id327)) Add support for
  encrypt-then-MAC (ETM) schemes (`hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com`,
  `hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com`) and two newer Diffie-Hellman group key
  exchange algorithms (`group14`, using SHA256; and `group16`, using
  SHA512). Patch courtesy of Edgar Sousa.
* [:feature:`532`](#id329) (via [:issue:`1384`](#id331) and [:issue:`1258`](#id333)) Add support for
  Curve25519 key exchange (aka `curve25519-sha256@libssh.org`). Thanks to
  Alex Gaynor and Dan Fuhry for supplying patches.
* [:support:`1379`](#id335) (also [:issue:`1369`](#id337)) Raise Cryptography dependency
  requirement to version 2.5 (from 1.5) and update some deprecated uses of its
  API.

  This removes a bunch of warnings of the style
  `CryptographyDeprecationWarning: encode_point has been deprecated on
  EllipticCurvePublicNumbers and will be removed in a future version. Please
  use EllipticCurvePublicKey.public_bytes to obtain both compressed and
  uncompressed point encoding` and similar, which users who had eventually
  upgraded to Cryptography 2.x would encounter.

  Warning

  This change is backwards incompatible **if** you are unable to upgrade your
  version of Cryptography. Please see [Cryptography's own changelog](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/changelog/) for details on what may
  change when you upgrade; for the most part the only changes involved
  dropping older Python versions (such as 2.6, 3.3, or some PyPy editions)
  which Paramiko itself has already dropped.
* [:support:`1378 backported`](#id339) Add support for the modern (as of Python 3.3)
  import location of `MutableMapping` (used in host key management) to avoid
  the old location becoming deprecated in Python 3.8. Thanks to Josh Karpel for
  catch & patch.

* [🐛`-`](#id351) Modify protocol message handling such that `Transport` does not
  respond to `MSG_UNIMPLEMENTED` with its own `MSG_UNIMPLEMENTED`. This
  behavior probably didn't cause any outright errors, but it doesn't seem to
  conform to the RFCs and could cause (non-infinite) feedback loops in some
  scenarios (usually those involving Paramiko on both ends).
* [🐛`1283`](#id353) Fix exploit (CVE-2018-1000805) in Paramiko's server mode (**not**
  client mode) where hostile clients could trick the server into thinking they
  were authenticated without actually submitting valid authentication.

  Specifically, steps have been taken to start separating client and server
  related message types in the message handling tables within `Transport` and
  `AuthHandler`; this work is not complete but enough has been performed to
  close off this particular exploit (which was the only obvious such exploit
  for this particular channel).

  Thanks to Daniel Hoffman for the detailed report.
* [:support:`1292 backported (<2.4)`](#id355) Backport changes from [:issue:`979`](#id357) (added
  in Paramiko
  2.3) to Paramiko 2.0-2.2, using duck-typing to preserve backwards
  compatibility. This allows these older versions to use newer Cryptography
  sign/verify APIs when available, without requiring them (as is the case with
  Paramiko 2.3+).

  Practically speaking, this change prevents spamming of
  `CryptographyDeprecationWarning` notices which pop up in the above scenario
  (older Paramiko, newer Cryptography).

  Note

  This is a no-op for Paramiko 2.3+, which have required newer Cryptography
  releases since they were released.
* [:support:`1291 backported (<2.4)`](#id359) Backport pytest support and application of
  the `black` code formatter (both of which previously only existed in the
  2.4 branch and above) to everything 2.0 and newer. This makes back/forward
  porting bugfixes significantly easier.
* [:support:`1262 backported`](#id361) Add `*.pub` files to the MANIFEST so distributed
  source packages contain some necessary test assets. Credit: Alexander
  Kapshuna.
* [:feature:`1212`](#id363) Updated SSHConfig.lookup <paramiko.config.SSHConfig.lookup>
  so it returns a new, type-casting-friendly dict subclass
  (~paramiko.config.SSHConfigDict) in lieu of dict literals. This ought to be
  backwards compatible, and allows an easier way to check boolean or int type
  `ssh_config` values. Thanks to Chris Rose for the patch.
* [:support:`1191`](#id365) Update our install docs with (somewhat) recently added
  additional dependencies; we previously only required Cryptography, but the
  docs never got updated after we incurred `bcrypt` and `pynacl`
  requirements for Ed25519 key support.

  Additionally, `pyasn1` was never actually hard-required; it was necessary
  during a development branch, and is used by the optional GSSAPI support, but
  is not required for regular installation. Thus, it has been removed from our
  `setup.py` and its imports in the GSSAPI code made optional.

  Credit to `@stevenwinfield` for highlighting the outdated install docs.

* [🐛`1039`](#id385) Ed25519 auth key decryption raised an unexpected exception when
  given a unicode password string (typical in python 3). Report by Theodor van
  Nahl and fix by Pierce Lopez.
* [:release:`2.4.0 <2017-11-14>`](#id387)
* [:feature:`-`](#id389) Add a new `passphrase` kwarg to SSHClient.connect
  <paramiko.client.SSHClient.connect> so users may disambiguate key-decryption
  passphrases from password-auth passwords. (This is a backwards compatible
  change; `password` will still pull double duty as a passphrase when
  `passphrase` is not given.)
* [:support:`-`](#id391) Update `tearDown` of client test suite to avoid hangs due to
  eternally blocking `accept()` calls on the internal server thread (which
  can occur when test code raises an exception before actually connecting to
  the server.)
* [🐛`1108 (1.17+)`](#id393) Rename a private method keyword argument (which was named
  `async`) so that we're compatible with the upcoming Python 3.7 release
  (where `async` is a new keyword.) Thanks to `@vEpiphyte` for the report.
* [:support:`1100`](#id395) Updated the test suite & related docs/metadata/config to be
  compatible with pytest instead of using the old, custom, crufty
  unittest-based `test.py`.

  This includes marking known-slow tests (mostly the SFTP ones) so they can be
  filtered out by `inv test`'s default behavior; as well as other minor
  tweaks to test collection and/or display (for example, GSSAPI tests are
  collected, but skipped, instead of not even being collected by default as in
  `test.py`.)
* [:support:`- backported`](#id397) Include LICENSE file in wheel archives.
* [:support:`1070`](#id399) Drop Python 2.6 and Python 3.3 support; now only 2.7 and 3.4+
  are supported. If you're unable to upgrade from 2.6 or 3.3, please stick to
  the Paramiko 2.3.x (or below) release lines.
* [:release:`2.3.1 <2017-09-22>`](#id401)
* [🐛`1071`](#id403) Certificate support broke the no-certificate case for Ed25519
  keys (symptom is an `AttributeError` about `public_blob`.) This went
  uncaught due to cert autoload behavior (i.e. our test suite never actually
  ran the no-cert case, because the cert existed!) Both issues have been fixed.
  Thanks to John Hu for the report.
* [:release:`2.3.0 <2017-09-18>`](#id405)
* [:release:`2.2.2 <2017-09-18>`](#id407)
* [:release:`2.1.4 <2017-09-18>`](#id409)
* [:release:`2.0.7 <2017-09-18>`](#id411)
* [:release:`1.18.4 <2017-09-18>`](#id413)
* [🐛`1065`](#id415) Add rekeying support to GSSAPI connections, which was erroneously
  missing. Without this fix, any attempt to renegotiate the transport keys for
  a `gss-kex`-authed ~paramiko.transport.Transport would cause a MIC
  failure and terminate the connection. Thanks to Sebastian Deiß and Anselm
  Kruis for the patch.
* [:feature:`1063`](#id417) Add a `gss_trust_dns` option to `Client` and
  `Transport` to allow explicitly setting whether or not DNS canonicalization
  should occur when using GSSAPI. Thanks to Richard E. Silverman for the report
  & Sebastian Deiß for initial patchset.
* [🐛`1061`](#id419) Clean up GSSAPI authentication procedures so they do not prevent
  normal fallback to other authentication methods on failure. (In other words,
  presence of GSSAPI functionality on a target server precluded use of \_any\_
  other auth type if the user was unable to pass GSSAPI auth.) Patch via Anselm
  Kruis.
* [🐛`1060`](#id421) Fix key exchange (kex) algorithm list for GSSAPI authentication;
  previously, the list used solely out-of-date algorithms, and now contains
  newer ones listed preferentially before the old. Credit: Anselm Kruis.
* [🐛`1055 (1.17+)`](#id423) (also [:issue:`1056`](#id425), [:issue:`1057`](#id427), [:issue:`1058`](#id429),
  [:issue:`1059`](#id431)) Fix up host-key checking in our GSSAPI support, which was
  previously using an incorrect API call. Thanks to Anselm Kruis for the
  patches.
* [🐛`945 (1.18+)`](#id433) (backport of [:issue:`910`](#id435) and re: [:issue:`865`](#id437)) SSHClient
  now requests the type of host key it has (e.g. from known\_hosts) and does not
  consider a different type to be a "Missing" host key. This fixes a common
  case where an ECDSA key is in known\_hosts and the server also has an RSA host
  key. Thanks to Pierce Lopez.
* [:support:`979`](#id439) Update how we use [Cryptography](https://cryptography.io)'s
  signature/verification methods so we aren't relying on a deprecated API.
  Thanks to Paul Kehrer for the patch.

  Warning

  This bumps the minimum Cryptography version from 1.1 to 1.5. Such an
  upgrade should be backwards compatible and easy to do. See [their changelog](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/changelog/) for additional details.
* [:support:`-`](#id441) Ed25519 keys never got proper API documentation support; this
  has been fixed.
* [:feature:`1026`](#id443) Update ~paramiko.ed25519key.Ed25519Key so its constructor
  offers the same `file_obj` parameter as its sibling key classes. Credit:
  Michal Kuffa.
* [:feature:`1013`](#id445) Added pre-authentication banner support for the server
  interface (ServerInterface.get\_banner
  <paramiko.server.ServerInterface.get\_banner> plus related support in
  `Transport/AuthHandler`.) Patch courtesy of Dennis Kaarsemaker.
* [🐛`60 major`](#id447) (via [:issue:`1037`](#id449)) Paramiko originally defaulted to zlib
  compression level 9 (when one connects with `compression=True`; it defaults
  to off.) This has been found to be quite wasteful and tends to cause much
  longer transfers in most cases, than is necessary.

  OpenSSH defaults to compression level 6, which is a much more reasonable
  setting (nearly identical compression characteristics but noticeably,
  sometimes significantly, faster transmission); Paramiko now uses this value
  instead.

  Thanks to Damien Dubé for the report and `@DrNeutron` for investigating &
  submitting the patch.
* [:support:`-`](#id451) Display exception type and message when logging auth-rejection
  messages (ones reading `Auth rejected: unsupported or mangled public key`);
  previously this error case had a bare except and did not display exactly why
  the key failed. It will now append info such as `KeyError:
  'some-unknown-type-string'` or similar.
* [:feature:`1042`](#id453) (also partially [:issue:`531`](#id455)) Implement basic client-side
  certificate authentication (as per the OpenSSH vendor extension.)

  The core implementation is PKey.load\_certificate
  <paramiko.pkey.PKey.load\_certificate> and its corresponding `.public_blob`
  attribute on key objects, which is honored in the auth and transport modules.
  Additionally, SSHClient.connect <paramiko.client.SSHClient.connect> will
  now automatically load certificate data alongside private key data when one
  has appropriately-named cert files (e.g. `id_rsa-cert.pub`) - see its
  docstring for details.

  Thanks to Jason Rigby for a first draft ([:issue:`531`](#id457)) and to Paul Kapp for
  the second draft, upon which the current functionality has been based (with
  modifications.)

  Note

  This support is client-focused; Paramiko-driven server code is capable of
  handling cert-bearing pubkey auth packets, *but* it does not interpret any
  cert-specific fields, so the end result is functionally identical to a
  vanilla pubkey auth process (and thus requires e.g. prepopulated
  authorized-keys data.) We expect full server-side cert support to follow
  later.
* [:support:`1041`](#id459) Modify logic around explicit disconnect
  messages, and unknown-channel situations, so that they rely on centralized
  shutdown code instead of running their own. This is at worst removing some
  unnecessary code, and may help with some situations where Paramiko hangs at
  the end of a session. Thanks to Paul Kapp for the patch.
* [:support:`1012`](#id461) (via [:issue:`1016`](#id463)) Enhance documentation around the new
  SFTP.posix\_rename <paramiko.sftp\_client.SFTPClient.posix\_rename> method so
  it's referenced in the 'standard' `rename` method for increased visibility.
  Thanks to Marius Flage for the report.
* [:release:`2.2.1 <2017-06-13>`](#id465)
* [🐛`993`](#id467) Ed25519 host keys were not comparable/hashable, causing an
  exception if such a key existed in a `known_hosts` file. Thanks to Oleh
  Prypin for the report and Pierce Lopez for the fix.
* [🐛`990`](#id469) The (added in 2.2.0) `bcrypt` dependency should have been on
  version 3.1.3 or greater (was initially set to 3.0.0 or greater.) Thanks to
  Paul Howarth for the report.
* [:release:`2.2.0 <2017-06-09>`](#id471)
* [:release:`2.1.3 <2017-06-09>`](#id473)
* [:release:`2.0.6 <2017-06-09>`](#id475)
* [:release:`1.18.3 <2017-06-09>`](#id477)
* [:release:`1.17.5 <2017-06-09>`](#id479)
* [🐛`865`](#id481) SSHClient now requests the type of host key it has (e.g. from
  known\_hosts) and does not consider a different type to be a "Missing" host
  key. This fixes a common case where an ECDSA key is in known\_hosts and the
  server also has an RSA host key. Thanks to Pierce Lopez.
* [:support:`906 (1.18+)`](#id483) Clean up a handful of outdated imports and related
  tweaks. Thanks to Pierce Lopez.
* [🐛`984`](#id485) Enhance default cipher preference order such that
  `aes(192|256)-cbc` are preferred over `blowfish-cbc`. Thanks to Alex
  Gaynor.
* [🐛`971 (1.17+)`](#id487) Allow any type implementing the buffer API to be used with
  BufferedFile <paramiko.file.BufferedFile>, Channel
  <paramiko.channel.Channel>, and SFTPFile <paramiko.sftp\_file.SFTPFile>.
  This resolves a regression introduced in 1.13 with the Python 3 porting
  changes, when using types such as `memoryview`. Credit: Martin Packman.
* [🐛`741`](#id489) (also [:issue:`809`](#id491), [:issue:`772`](#id493); all via [:issue:`912`](#id495)) Writing
  encrypted/password-protected private key files was silently broken since 2.0
  due to an incorrect API call; this has been fixed.

  Includes a directly related fix, namely adding the ability to read
  `AES-256-CBC` ciphered private keys (which is now what we tend to write out
  as it is Cryptography's default private key cipher.)

  Thanks to `@virlos` for the original report, Chris Harris and `@ibuler`
  for initial draft PRs, and `@jhgorrell` for the final patch.
* [:feature:`65`](#id497) (via [:issue:`471`](#id499)) Add support for OpenSSH's SFTP
  `posix-rename` protocol extension (section 3.3 of [OpenSSH's protocol
  extension document](http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/usr.bin/ssh/PROTOCOL?rev=1.31)),
  via a new `posix_rename` method in SFTPClient
  <paramiko.sftp\_client.SFTPClient.posix\_rename> and SFTPServerInterface
  <paramiko.sftp\_si.SFTPServerInterface.posix\_rename>. Thanks to Wren Turkal
  for the initial patch & Mika Pflüger for the enhanced, merged PR.
* [:feature:`869`](#id501) Add an `auth_timeout` kwarg to SSHClient.connect
  <paramiko.client.SSHClient.connect> (default: 30s) to avoid hangs when the
  remote end becomes unresponsive during the authentication step. Credit to
  `@timsavage`.

  Note

  This technically changes behavior, insofar as very slow auth steps >30s
  will now cause timeout exceptions instead of completing. We doubt most
  users will notice; those affected can simply give a higher value to
  `auth_timeout`.
* [:support:`921`](#id503) Tighten up the `__hash__` implementation for various key
  classes; less code is good code. Thanks to Francisco Couzo for the patch.
* [:support:`956 backported (1.17+)`](#id505) Switch code coverage service from
  coveralls.io to codecov.io (& then disable the latter's auto-comments.)
  Thanks to Nikolai Røed Kristiansen for the patch.
* [🐛`983`](#id507) Move `sha1` above the now-arguably-broken `md5` in the list of
  preferred MAC algorithms, as an incremental security improvement for users
  whose target systems offer both. Credit: Pierce Lopez.
* [🐛`667`](#id509) The RC4/arcfour family of ciphers has been broken since version
  2.0; but since the algorithm is now known to be completely insecure, we are
  opting to remove support outright instead of fixing it. Thanks to Alex Gaynor
  for catch & patch.
* [:feature:`857`](#id511) Allow SSHClient.set\_missing\_host\_key\_policy
  <paramiko.client.SSHClient.set\_missing\_host\_key\_policy> to accept policy
  classes \_or\_ instances, instead of only instances, thus fixing a
  long-standing gotcha for unaware users.
* [:feature:`951`](#id513) Add support for ECDH key exchange (kex), specifically the
  algorithms `ecdh-sha2-nistp256`, `ecdh-sha2-nistp384`, and
  `ecdh-sha2-nistp521`. They now come before the older `diffie-hellman-*`
  family of kex algorithms in the preferred-kex list. Thanks to Shashank
  Veerapaneni for the patch & Pierce Lopez for a follow-up.
* [:support:`- backported`](#id515) A big formatting pass to clean up an enormous number
  of invalid Sphinx reference links, discovered by switching to a modern,
  rigorous nitpicking doc-building mode.
* [🐛`900`](#id517) (via [:issue:`911`](#id519)) Prefer newer `ecdsa-sha2-nistp` keys over RSA
  and DSA keys during host key selection. This improves compatibility with
  OpenSSH, both in terms of general behavior, and also re: ability to properly
  leverage OpenSSH-modified `known_hosts` files. Credit: `@kasdoe` for
  original report/PR and Pierce Lopez for the second draft.
* [🐛`794`](#id521) (via [:issue:`981`](#id523)) Prior support for `ecdsa-sha2-nistp(384|521)`
  algorithms didn't fully extend to covering host keys, preventing connection
  to hosts which only offer these key types and no others. This is now fixed.
  Thanks to `@ncoult` and `@kasdoe` for reports and Pierce Lopez for the
  patch.
* [:feature:`325`](#id525) (via [:issue:`972`](#id527)) Add Ed25519 support, for both host keys
  and user authentication. Big thanks to Alex Gaynor for the patch.

  Note

  This change adds the `bcrypt` and `pynacl` Python libraries as
  dependencies. No C-level dependencies beyond those previously required (for
  Cryptography) have been added.
* [:support:`974 backported`](#id529) Overhaul the codebase to be PEP-8, etc, compliant
  (i.e. passes the maintainer's preferred [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/)
  configuration) and add a `flake8` step to the Travis config. Big thanks to
  Dorian Pula!
* [🐛`949 (1.17+)`](#id531) SSHClient and Transport could cause a memory leak if
  there's a connection problem or protocol error, even if `Transport.close()`
  is called. Thanks Kyle Agronick for the discovery and investigation, and
  Pierce Lopez for assistance.
* [🐛`683 (1.17+)`](#id533) Make `util.log_to_file` append instead of replace.
  Thanks to `@vlcinsky` for the report.

* [🐛`853 (1.17+)`](#id543) Tweak how RSAKey.\_\_str\_\_ <paramiko.rsakey.RSAKey>
  behaves so it doesn't cause `TypeError` under Python 3. Thanks to Francisco
  Couzo for the report.
* [🐛`862 (1.17+)`](#id545) (via [:issue:`863`](#id547)) Avoid test suite exceptions on
  platforms lacking `errno.ETIME` (which seems to be some FreeBSD and some
  Windows environments.) Thanks to Sofian Brabez.
* [🐛`44 (1.17+)`](#id549) (via [:issue:`891`](#id551)) SSHClient <paramiko.client.SSHClient>
  now gives its internal Transport <paramiko.transport.Transport> a handle on
  itself, preventing garbage collection of the client until the session is
  closed. Without this, some code which returns stream or transport objects
  without the client that generated them, would result in premature session
  closure when the client was GCd. Credit: `@w31rd0` for original report,
  Omer Anson for the patch.
* [🐛`713 (<2.0)`](#id553) (via [:issue:`714`](#id555) and [:issue:`889`](#id557)) Don't pass
  initialization vectors to PyCrypto when dealing with counter-mode ciphers;
  newer PyCrypto versions throw an exception otherwise (older ones simply
  ignored this parameter altogether). Thanks to `@jmh045000` for report &
  patches.
* [🐛`895 (1.17+)`](#id559) Fix a bug in server-mode concerning multiple interactive
  auth steps (which were incorrectly responded to). Thanks to Dennis
  Kaarsemaker for catch & patch.
* [:support:`866 backported (1.17+)`](#id561) (also [:issue:`838`](#id563)) Remove an old
  test-related file we don't support, and add PyPy to Travis-CI config. Thanks

* [🐛`859 (1.18+)`](#id571) (via [:issue:`860`](#id573)) A tweak to the original patch
  implementing [:issue:`398`](#id575) was not fully applied, causing calls to
  ~paramiko.client.SSHClient.invoke\_shell to fail with `AttributeError`.
  This has been fixed. Patch credit: Kirk Byers.
* [🐛`-`](#id577) Accidentally merged the new features from 1.18.0 into the
  2.0.x bugfix-only branch. This included merging a bug in one of those new
  features (breaking ~paramiko.client.SSHClient.invoke\_shell with an
  `AttributeError`.) The offending code has been stripped out of the 2.0.x
  line (but of course, remains in 2.1.x and above.)
* [🐛`859`](#id579) (via [:issue:`860`](#id581)) A tweak to the original patch implementing
  [:issue:`398`](#id583) was not fully applied, causing calls to
  ~paramiko.client.SSHClient.invoke\_shell to fail with `AttributeError`.
  This has been fixed. Patch credit: Kirk Byers.

* [🐛`802 (1.17+)`](#id593) (via [:issue:`804`](#id595)) Update our vendored Windows API module
  to address errors of the form `AttributeError: 'module' object has no
  attribute 'c_ssize_t'`. Credit to Jason R. Coombs.
* [🐛`824 (1.17+)`](#id597) Fix the implementation of `PKey.write_private_key_file`
  (this method is only publicly defined on subclasses; the fix was in the
  private real implementation) so it passes the correct params to `open()`.
  This bug apparently went unnoticed and unfixed for 12 entire years. Congrats
  to John Villalovos for noticing & submitting the patch!
* [:support:`801 backported (1.17+)`](#id599) Skip a Unix-only test when on Windows;
  thanks to Gabi Davar.

  thanks to Alan Yee.
* [:feature:`780 (1.18+)`](#id603) (also [:issue:`779`](#id605), and may help users affected by
  [:issue:`520`](#id607)) Add an optional `timeout` parameter to
  Transport.start\_client <paramiko.transport.Transport.start\_client> (and
  feed it the value of the configured connection timeout when used within
  SSHClient <paramiko.client.SSHClient>.) This helps prevent situations where
  network connectivity isn't timing out, but the remote server is otherwise
  unable to service the connection in a timely manner. Credit to
  `@sanseihappa`.
* [🐛`742`](#id609) (also re: [:issue:`559`](#id611)) Catch `AssertionError` thrown by
  Cryptography when attempting to load bad ECDSA keys, turning it into an
  `SSHException`. This moves the behavior in line with other "bad keys"
  situations, re: Paramiko's main auth loop. Thanks to MengHuan Yu for the
  patch.
* [🐛`789 (1.17+)`](#id613) Add a missing `.closed` attribute (plus `._closed`
  because reasons) to ProxyCommand <paramiko.proxy.ProxyCommand> so the
  earlier partial fix for [:issue:`520`](#id615) works in situations where one is
  gatewaying via `ProxyCommand`.
* [🐛`334 (1.17+)`](#id617) Make the `subprocess` import in `proxy.py` lazy so
  users on platforms without it (such as Google App Engine) can import Paramiko
  successfully. (Relatedly, make it easier to tweak an active socket check
  timeout [in Transport <paramiko.transport.Transport>] which was previously
  hardcoded.) Credit: Shinya Okano.
* [:support:`854 backported (1.17+)`](#id619) Fix incorrect docstring/param-list for
  Transport.auth\_gssapi\_keyex
  <paramiko.transport.Transport.auth\_gssapi\_keyex> so it matches the real
  signature. Caught by `@Score_Under`.
* [🐛`681 (1.17+)`](#id621) Fix a Python3-specific bug re: the handling of read
  buffers when using `ProxyCommand`. Thanks to Paul Kapp for catch & patch.
* [:feature:`398 (1.18+)`](#id623) Add an `environment` dict argument to
  Client.exec\_command <paramiko.client.SSHClient.exec\_command> (plus the
  lower level Channel.update\_environment
  <paramiko.channel.Channel.update\_environment> and
  Channel.set\_environment\_variable
  <paramiko.channel.Channel.set\_environment\_variable> methods) which
  implements the `env` SSH message type. This means the remote shell
  environment can be set without the use of `VARNAME=value` shell tricks,
  provided the server's `AcceptEnv` lists the variables you need to set.
  Thanks to Philip Lorenz for the pull request.
* [:support:`819 backported (>=1.15,<2.0)`](#id625) Document how lacking `gmp` headers
  at install time can cause a significant performance hit if you build PyCrypto
  from source. (Most system-distributed packages already have this enabled.)

  (`SSHException`) which would occasionally pop up when using
  `ProxyCommand` gatewaying. Thanks to `@Depado` for the initial report and
  Paul Kapp for the fix.
* [🐛`774 (1.16+)`](#id637) Add a `_closed` private attribute to
  ~paramiko.channel.Channel objects so that they continue functioning when
  used as proxy sockets under Python 3 (e.g. as `direct-tcpip` gateways for
  other Paramiko connections.)
* [🐛`758 (1.16+)`](#id639) Apply type definitions to `_winapi` module from
  [jaraco.windows](https://github.com/jaraco/jaraco.windows) 3.6.1. This
  should address issues on Windows platforms that often result in errors like
  `ArgumentError: [...] int too long to convert`. Thanks to `@swohlerLL`

  driven threading hangs at end of the Python interpreter session. (Includes a
  docs update as well - always make sure to `.close()` your clients!)
* [🐛`537 (1.16+)`](#id649) Fix a bug in BufferedPipe.set\_event
  <paramiko.buffered\_pipe.BufferedPipe.set\_event> which could cause
  deadlocks/hangs when one uses select.select against
  ~paramiko.channel.Channel objects (or otherwise calls Channel.fileno

  and 512-bit elliptic curve groups in ECDSA key types (aka
  `ecdsa-sha2-nistp384` / `ecdsa-sha2-nistp521`). Thanks to Michiel Tiller
  and `@CrazyCasta` for the patches.
* [🐛`670`](#id663) Due to an earlier bugfix, less-specific `Host` blocks'
  `ProxyCommand` values were overriding `ProxyCommand none` in
  more-specific `Host` blocks. This has been fixed in a backwards compatible
  manner (i.e. `ProxyCommand none` continues to appear as a total lack of any
  `proxycommand` key in parsed config structures). Thanks to Pat Brisbin for
  the catch.
* [🐛`676`](#id665) (via [:issue:`677`](#id667)) Fix a backwards incompatibility issue that
  cropped up in SFTPFile.prefetch <paramiko.sftp\_file.SFTPFile.prefetch> re:
  the erroneously non-optional `file_size` parameter. Should only affect
  users who manually call `prefetch`. Thanks to `@stevevanhooser` for catch
  & patch.
* [:feature:`394`](#id669) Replace PyCrypto with the Python Cryptographic Authority
  (PyCA) 'Cryptography' library suite. This improves security, installability,
  and performance; adds PyPy support; and much more.

  There aren't enough ways to thank Alex Gaynor for all of his work on this,
  and then his patience while the maintainer let his PR grow moss for a year
  and change. Paul Kehrer came in with an assist, and I think I saw Olle
  Lundberg, `@techtonik` and `@johnthagen` supplying backup as well. Thanks
  to all!

  Warning

  **This is a backwards incompatible change.**

  However, **it should only affect installation** requirements; **no API
  changes are intended or expected**. Please report any such breakages as
  bugs.

  See our updated [:doc:`installation docs <installing>`](#id671) for details on what
  is now required to install Paramiko; many/most users should be able to
  simply `pip install -U paramiko` (especially if you **upgrade to pip
  8**).

* [🐛`194 major`](#id721) (also [:issue:`562`](#id723), [:issue:`530`](#id725), [:issue:`576`](#id727)) Streamline
  use of `stat` when downloading SFTP files via SFTPClient.get
  <paramiko.sftp\_client.SFTPClient.get>; this avoids triggering bugs in some
  off-spec SFTP servers such as IBM Sterling. Thanks to `@muraleee` for the
  initial report and to Torkil Gustavsen for the patch.
* [:feature:`467`](#id729) (also [:issue:`139`](#id731), [:issue:`412`](#id733)) Fully enable two-factor

  representation doesn't raise exceptions on empty/initialized instances. Patch
  by Ulrich Petri.
* [🐛`359`](#id755) Use correct attribute name when trying to use Python 3's
  `int.bit_length` method; prior to fix, the Python 2 custom fallback
  implementation was always used, even on Python 3. Thanks to Alex Gaynor.

  based key exchange (kex) algorithm `diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256`
  and (H)MAC algorithms `hmac-sha2-256` and `hmac-sha2-512`.

  This change includes tweaks to debug-level logging regarding
  algorithm-selection handshakes; the old all-in-one log line is now multiple
  easier-to-read, printed-at-handshake-time log lines.

  Thanks to the many people who submitted patches for this functionality and/or
  assisted in testing those patches. That list includes but is not limited to,
  and in no particular order: Matthias Witte, Dag Wieers, Ash Berlin, Etienne

  handshakes. Credit to `@vazir` and `@dacut` for the original patches and
  to Olle Lundberg for reimplementation.
* [🐛`490`](#id789) Skip invalid/unparsable lines in `known_hosts` files, instead
  of raising ~paramiko.ssh\_exception.SSHException. This brings Paramiko's
  behavior more in line with OpenSSH, which silently ignores such input. Catch
  & patch courtesy of Martin Topholm.
* [🐛`404`](#id791) Print details when displaying
  ~paramiko.ssh\_exception.BadHostKeyException objects (expected vs received
  data) instead of just "hey shit broke". Patch credit: Loic Dachary.
* [🐛`469`](#id793) (also [:issue:`488`](#id795), [:issue:`461`](#id797) and like a dozen others) Fix a

  everyone who submitted patches, and to Steve Cohen who was the lucky winner
  of the cherry-pick lottery.
* [🐛`353`](#id799) (via [:issue:`482`](#id801)) Fix a bug introduced in the Python 3 port
  which caused `OverFlowError` (and other symptoms) in SFTP functionality.
  Thanks to `@dboreham` for leading the troubleshooting charge, and to
  Scott Maxwell for the final patch.

  breaking `bdist_dumb` on Mac OS X. Thanks to Peter Odding for the patch.
* [🐛`22 major`](#id805) Try harder to connect to multiple network families (e.g. IPv4
  vs IPv6) in case of connection issues; this helps with problems such as hosts
  which resolve both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses but are only listening on IPv4.
  Thanks to Dries Desmet for original report and Torsten Landschoff for the
  foundational patchset.
* [🐛`402`](#id807) Check to see if an SSH agent is actually present before trying to
  forward it to the remote end. This replaces what was usually a useless
  `TypeError` with a human-readable
  ~paramiko.ssh\_exception.AuthenticationException. Credit to Ken Jordan for
  the fix and Yvan Marques for original report.

  report & initial patchset and to Chris Adams & John Morrissey for followup
  improvements.
* [🐛`455`](#id823) Tweak packet size handling to conform better to the OpenSSH RFCs;
  this helps address issues with interactive program cursors. Courtesy of Jeff
  Quast.
* [🐛`428`](#id825) Fix an issue in ~paramiko.file.BufferedFile (primarily used in
  the SFTP modules) concerning incorrect behavior by
  ~paramiko.file.BufferedFile.readlines on files whose size exceeds the
  buffer size. Thanks to `@achapp` for catch & patch.
* [🐛`415`](#id827) Fix `ssh_config` parsing to correctly interpret `ProxyCommand
  none` as the lack of a proxy command, instead of as a literal command string
  of `"none"`. Thanks to Richard Spiers for the catch & Sean Johnson for the
  fix.
* [:support:`431 backported`](#id829) Replace handrolled `ssh_config` parsing code with
  use of the `shlex` module. Thanks to Yan Kalchevskiy.

  `@egroeper` for catch & patch.
* [🐛`459`](#id839) Tighten up agent connection closure behavior to avoid spurious
  `ResourceWarning` display in some situations. Thanks to `@tkrapp` for the
  catch.
* [🐛`429`](#id841) Server-level debug message logging was overlooked during the
  Python 3 compatibility update; Python 3 clients attempting to log SSH debug
  packets encountered type errors. This is now fixed. Thanks to `@mjmaenpaa`
  for the catch.
* [🐛`320`](#id843) Update our win\_pageant module to be Python 3 compatible. Thanks to
  `@sherbang` and `@adamkerz` for the patches.
* [:release:`1.15.1 <2014-09-22>`](#id845)
* [🐛`399`](#id847) SSH agent forwarding (potentially other functionality as
  well) would hang due to incorrect values passed into the new window size
  arguments for ~paramiko.transport.Transport (thanks to a botched merge).
  This has been corrected. Thanks to Dylan Thacker-Smith for the report &
  patch.
* [:feature:`167`](#id849) Add ~paramiko.config.SSHConfig.get\_hostnames for easier
  introspection of a loaded SSH config file or object. Courtesy of Søren

  requirement for using this functionality) only appears to support
  Python 2.7 and up at this time.
* [🐛`346 major`](#id865) Fix an issue in private key files' encryption salts that
  could cause tracebacks and file corruption if keys were re-encrypted. Credit
  to Xavier Nunn.
* [:feature:`362`](#id867) Allow users to control the SSH banner timeout. Thanks to Cory
  Benfield.
* [:feature:`372`](#id869) Update default window & packet sizes to more closely adhere to
  the pertinent RFC; also expose these settings in the public API so they may
  be overridden by client code. This should address some general speed issues
  such as [:issue:`175`](#id871). Big thanks to Olle Lundberg for the update.
* [🐛`373 major`](#id873) Attempt to fix a handful of issues (such as [:issue:`354`](#id875))
  related to infinite loops and threading deadlocks. Thanks to Olle Lundberg as
  well as a handful of community members who provided advice & feedback via

  a decorator. Thanks to Olle Lundberg for original patch.
* [🐛`298 major`](#id883) Don't perform point validation on ECDSA keys in
  `known_hosts` files, since a) this can cause significant slowdown when such
  keys exist, and b) `known_hosts` files are implicitly trustworthy. Thanks
  to Kieran Spear for catch & patch.

  Note

  This change bumps up the version requirement for the `ecdsa` library to
  `0.11`.

  Wellington.
* [🐛`312`](#id907) paramiko.transport.Transport had a bug in its `__repr__` which
  surfaces during errors encountered within its `__init__`, causing
  problematic tracebacks in such situations. Thanks to Simon Percivall for
  catch & patch.
* [🐛`272`](#id909) Fix a bug where `known_hosts` parsing hashed the input hostname
  as well as the hostnames from the `known_hosts` file, on every comparison.
  Thanks to `@sigmunau` for final patch and `@ostacey` for the original
  report.
* [🐛`239`](#id911) Add Windows-style CRLF support to SSH config file parsing. Props

  paramiko.sftp\_client.SFTPClient.put thanks to Abhinav Upadhyay.
* [🐛`285`](#id917) (also [:issue:`352`](#id919)) Update our Python 3 `b()` compatibility shim
  to handle `buffer` objects correctly; this fixes a frequently reported
  issue affecting many users, including users of the `bzr` software suite.
  Thanks to `@basictheprogram` for the initial report, Jelmer Vernooij for
  the fix and Andrew Starr-Bochicchio & Jeremy T. Bouse (among others) for
  discussion & feedback.

* [🐛`-`](#id931) paramiko.file.BufferedFile.read incorrectly returned text strings
  after the Python 3 migration, despite bytes being more appropriate for file
  contents (which may be binary or of an unknown encoding.) This has been
  addressed.

  Note

  paramiko.file.BufferedFile.readline continues to return strings, not
  bytes, as "lines" only make sense for textual data. It assumes UTF-8 by
  default.

  This should fix [this issue raised on the Obnam mailing list](http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.sysutils.backup.obnam/252). Thanks
  to Antoine Brenner for the patch.

  > + Mega thanks to Ethan Glasser-Camp for the patch.
* [:feature:`136`](#id1007) Add server-side support for the SSH protocol's 'env' command.
  Thanks to Benjamin Pollack for the patch.
* [🐛`156 (1.11+)`](#id1009) Fix potential deadlock condition when using Channel
  objects as sockets (e.g. when using SSH gatewaying). Thanks to Steven Noonan
  and Frank Arnold for catch & patch.
* [🐛`179`](#id1011) Fix a missing variable causing errors when an ssh\_config file has
  a non-default AddressFamily set. Thanks to Ed Marshall & Tomaz Muraus for
  catch & patch.
* [🐛`200`](#id1013) Fix an exception-causing typo in `demo_simple.py`. Thanks to Alex
  Buchanan for catch & Dave Foster for patch.
* [🐛`199`](#id1015) Typo fix in the license header cross-project. Thanks to Armin
  Ronacher for catch & patch.
* [:release:`1.11.1 <2013-09-20>`](#id1017)
* [:release:`1.10.3 <2013-09-20>`](#id1019)
* [🐛`162`](#id1021) Clean up HMAC module import to avoid deadlocks in certain uses of
  SSHClient. Thanks to Gernot Hillier for the catch & suggested fix.
* [🐛`36`](#id1023) Fix the port-forwarding demo to avoid file descriptor errors.
  Thanks to Jonathan Halcrow for catch & patch.
* [🐛`168`](#id1025) Update config handling to properly handle multiple 'localforward'
  and 'remoteforward' keys. Thanks to Emre Yılmaz for the patch.
* [:release:`1.11.0 <2013-07-26>`](#id1027)
* [:release:`1.10.2 <2013-07-26>`](#id1029)
* [🐛`98 major`](#id1031) On Windows, when interacting with the PuTTY PAgeant, Paramiko
  now creates the shared memory map with explicit Security Attributes of the
  user, which is the same technique employed by the canonical PuTTY library to
  avoid permissions issues when Paramiko is running under a different UAC
  context than the PuTTY Ageant process. Thanks to Jason R. Coombs for the
  patch.
* [:support:`100`](#id1033) Remove use of PyWin32 in `win_pageant` module. Module was
  already dependent on ctypes for constructing appropriate structures and had
  ctypes implementations of all functionality. Thanks to Jason R. Coombs for
  the patch.
* [🐛`87 major`](#id1035) Ensure updates to `known_hosts` files account for any
  updates to said files after Paramiko initially read them. (Includes related
  fix to guard against duplicate entries during subsequent `known_hosts`
  loads.) Thanks to `@sunweaver` for the contribution.
* [🐛`153`](#id1037) (also [:issue:`67`](#id1039)) Warn on parse failure when reading known\_hosts
  file. Thanks to `@glasserc` for patch.
* [🐛`146`](#id1041) Indentation fixes for readability. Thanks to Abhinav Upadhyay for
  catch & patch.
* [:release:`1.10.1 <2013-04-05>`](#id1043)
* [🐛`142`](#id1045) ([Fabric #811](https://github.com/fabric/fabric/issues/811))
  SFTP put of empty file will still return the attributes of the put file.
  Thanks to Jason R. Coombs for the patch.
* [🐛`154`](#id1047) ([Fabric #876](https://github.com/fabric/fabric/issues/876))
  Forwarded SSH agent connections left stale local pipes lying around, which
  could cause local (and sometimes remote or network) resource starvation when
  running many agent-using remote commands. Thanks to Kevin Tegtmeier for catch
  & patch.
* [:release:`1.10.0 <2013-03-01>`](#id1049)
* [:feature:`66`](#id1051) Batch SFTP writes to help speed up file transfers. Thanks to
  Olle Lundberg for the patch.
* [🐛`133 major`](#id1053) Fix handling of window-change events to be on-spec and not
  attempt to wait for a response from the remote sshd; this fixes problems with
  less common targets such as some Cisco devices. Thanks to Phillip Heller for
  catch & patch.
* [:feature:`93`](#id1055) Overhaul SSH config parsing to be in line with `man
  ssh_config` (& the behavior of `ssh` itself), including addition of parameter
  expansion within config values. Thanks to Olle Lundberg for the patch.
* [:feature:`110`](#id1057) Honor SSH config `AddressFamily` setting when looking up
  local host's FQDN. Thanks to John Hensley for the patch.
* [:feature:`128`](#id1059) Defer FQDN resolution until needed, when parsing SSH config
  files. Thanks to Parantapa Bhattacharya for catch & patch.
* [🐛`102 major`](#id1061) Forego random padding for packets when running under
  `*-ctr` ciphers. This corrects some slowdowns on platforms where random
  byte generation is inefficient (e.g. Windows). Thanks to `@warthog618` for
  catch & patch, and Michael van der Kolff for code/technique review.
* [:feature:`127`](#id1063) Turn `SFTPFile` into a context manager. Thanks to Michael
  Williamson for the patch.
* [:feature:`116`](#id1065) Limit `Message.get_bytes` to an upper bound of 1MB to protect
  against potential DoS vectors. Thanks to `@mvschaik` for catch & patch.
* [:feature:`115`](#id1067) Add convenience `get_pty` kwarg to `Client.exec_command` so
  users not manually controlling a channel object can still toggle PTY
  creation. Thanks to Michael van der Kolff for the patch.
* [:feature:`71`](#id1069) Add `SFTPClient.putfo` and `.getfo` methods to allow direct
  uploading/downloading of file-like objects. Thanks to Eric Buehl for the
  patch.
* [:feature:`113`](#id1071) Add `timeout` parameter to `SSHClient.exec_command` for
  easier setting of the command's internal channel object's timeout. Thanks to
  Cernov Vladimir for the patch.
* [:support:`94`](#id1073) Remove duplication of SSH port constant. Thanks to Olle
  Lundberg for the catch.
* [:feature:`80`](#id1075) Expose the internal "is closed" property of the file transfer
  class `BufferedFile` as `.closed`, better conforming to Python's file
  interface. Thanks to `@smunaut` and James Hiscock for catch & patch.

:Paramiko: Python SSH module

:API docs: <http://docs.paramiko.org>

What
----

"paramiko" is a combination of the esperanto words for "paranoid" and
"friend".  it's a module for python 2.6+ that implements the SSH2 protocol
for secure (encrypted and authenticated) connections to remote machines.
unlike SSL (aka TLS), SSH2 protocol does not require hierarchical
certificates signed by a powerful central authority. you may know SSH2 as
the protocol that replaced telnet and rsh for secure access to remote
shells, but the protocol also includes the ability to open arbitrary
channels to remote services across the encrypted tunnel (this is how sftp
works, for example).

it is written entirely in python (no C or platform-dependent code) and is
released under the GNU LGPL (lesser GPL).

the package and its API is fairly well documented in the "doc/" folder
that should have come with this archive.

Requirements
------------

  - Python 2.6 or better <<http://www.python.org/>> - this includes Python
    3.2 and higher as well.
  - pycrypto 2.1 or better <<https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/>>
  - ecdsa 0.9 or better <<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ecdsa>>

If you have setuptools, you can build and install paramiko and all its
dependencies with this command (as root)::

    easy_install ./

Portability
-----------

i code and test this library on Linux and MacOS X. for that reason, i'm
pretty sure that it works for all posix platforms, including MacOS. it
should also work on Windows, though i don't test it as frequently there.
if you run into Windows problems, send me a patch: portability is important
to me.

some python distributions don't include the utf-8 string encodings, for
reasons of space (misdirected as that is). if your distribution is
missing encodings, you'll see an error like this::

    LookupError: no codec search functions registered: can't find encoding

this means you need to copy string encodings over from a working system.
(it probably only happens on embedded systems, not normal python
installs.) Valeriy Pogrebitskiy says the best place to look is
``.../lib/python*/encodings/__init__.py``.

Bugs & Support
--------------

Please file bug reports at <https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/>. There is currently no mailing list but we plan to create a new one ASAP.

Kerberos Support
----------------

Paramiko ships with optional Kerberos/GSSAPI support; for info on the extra
dependencies for this, see the 'GSS-API' section on the 'Installation' page of
our main website, <http://paramiko.org> .

Demo
----

several demo scripts come with paramiko to demonstrate how to use it.
probably the simplest demo of all is this::

    import paramiko, base64
    key = paramiko.RSAKey(data=base64.decodestring('AAA...'))
    client = paramiko.SSHClient()
    client.get_host_keys().add('ssh.example.com', 'ssh-rsa', key)
    client.connect('ssh.example.com', username='strongbad', password='thecheat')
    stdin, stdout, stderr = client.exec_command('ls')
    for line in stdout:
        print '... ' + line.strip('\n')
    client.close()

...which prints out the results of executing ``ls`` on a remote server.
(the host key 'AAA...' should of course be replaced by the actual base64
encoding of the host key.  if you skip host key verification, the
connection is not secure!)

the following example scripts (in demos/) get progressively more detailed:

:demo_simple.py:
    calls invoke_shell() and emulates a terminal/tty through which you can
    execute commands interactively on a remote server.  think of it as a
    poor man's ssh command-line client.

:demo.py:
    same as demo_simple.py, but allows you to authenticiate using a
    private key, attempts to use an SSH-agent if present, and uses the long
    form of some of the API calls.

:forward.py:
    command-line script to set up port-forwarding across an ssh transport.
    (requires python 2.3.)

:demo_sftp.py:
    opens an sftp session and does a few simple file operations.

:demo_server.py:
    an ssh server that listens on port 2200 and accepts a login for
    'robey' (password 'foo'), and pretends to be a BBS.  meant to be a
    very simple demo of writing an ssh server.

:demo_keygen.py:
    an key generator similar to openssh ssh-keygen(1) program with
    paramiko keys generation and progress functions.

Use
---

the demo scripts are probably the best example of how to use this package.
there is also a lot of documentation, generated with Sphinx autodoc, in the doc/ folder.

there are also unit tests here::

    $ python ./test.py

which will verify that most of the core components are working correctly.

```

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1557130#c0)  Sam Fowler    2018-03-16 04:42:33 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the implementation of transport.py in Paramiko before 1.17.6, 1.18.x before 1.18.5, 2.0.x before 2.0.8, 2.1.x before 2.1.5, 2.2.x before 2.2.3, 2.3.x before 2.3.2, and 2.4.x before 2.4.1 does not properly check whether authentication is completed before processing other requests, as demonstrated by channel-open. A customized SSH client can simply skip the authentication step.

Where paramiko is used only for its client-side functionality (e.g. `paramiko.SSHClient`), the vulnerability is not exposed and thus cannot be exploited.  The following Red Hat products use paramiko only in client-side mode.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1559133#c0)  Alfredo Moralejo    2018-03-21 18:30:02 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  When using python-paramiko to build openstack-sahara-tests in RDO, we find following error:  Failed to import test module: sahara_tests.unit.scenario.test_base Traceback (most recent call last):   File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/unittest2/loader.py", line 445, in _find_test_path     module = self._get_module_from_name(name)   File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/unittest2/loader.py", line 384, in _get_module_from_name     __import__(name)   File "sahara_tests/unit/scenario/test_base.py", line 30, in <module>     from sahara_tests.scenario import base   File "sahara_tests/scenario/base.py", line 29, in <module>     from tempest.lib.common import ssh as connection   File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tempest/lib/common/ssh.py", line 30, in <module>     import paramiko   File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/paramiko/__init__.py", line 30, in <module>     from paramiko.transport import SecurityOptions, Transport   File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/paramiko/transport.py", line 37, in <module>     from paramiko.auth_handler import AuthHandler   File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/paramiko/auth_handler.py", line 44, in <module>     from paramiko.ssh_gss import GSSAuth   File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/paramiko/ssh_gss.py", line 42, in <module>     from pyasn1.type.univ import ObjectIdentifier ImportError: No module named pyasn1.type.univ  Looking at code and spec file, it seems package is missing some requirements as python-pyasn1.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  python-paramiko-2.1.1-2.el7  How reproducible:  always  Additional info:  Note that, with the version of python-cryptography-1.7.2-1.el7_4.1 depends on python-pyasn1 so, python-paramiko get it installed indirectly, but newer vrsions of cryptography removed that dependency so python-paramiko is broken and needs to explicitely depend on it.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1559133#c5)  Leos Pol    2018-03-22 16:27:33 UTC  ``` rpm -qp --requires python-paramiko-2.1.1-4.el7.noarch.rpm python(abi) = 2.7 python-cryptography python2-pyasn1 rpmlib(CompressedFileNames) <= 3.0.4-1 rpmlib(FileDigests) <= 4.6.0-1 rpmlib(PartialHardlinkSets) <= 4.0.4-1 rpmlib(PayloadFilesHavePrefix) <= 4.0-1 rpmlib(PayloadIsXz) <= 5.2-1   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1559133#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-03-26 14:45:39 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.  For information on the advisory, and where to find the updated files, follow the link below.  If the solution does not work for you, open a new bug report.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

Version        : 2.0.0-1+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-7750 CVE-2018-1000805
Debian Bug     : 892859 910760

A couple of vulnerabilites were found in paramiko, an implementation
of SSHv2 protocol in Python.

CVE-2018-1000805

     Fix to prevent malicious clients to trick the Paramiko server
     into thinking an unauthenticated client is authenticated.

CVE-2018-7750

     Fix check whether authentication is completed before processing
     other requests. A customized SSH client can simply skip the
     authentication step.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
2.0.0-1+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your paramiko packages.

For the detailed security status of paramiko please refer to

## Description

[![@bitprophet](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6088?u=363ed719bdbb31c90f5dfcbc422ccf63748a0008&v=4&size=48)](/bitprophet)[bitprophet](https://github.com/bitprophet)opened [on Mar 13, 2018](https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/issues/1175#issue-304582845)

What follows is a direct paste from a private gist used to workshop the issue a bit late last week; have completed tests/impl (from 1.17+) and will be pushing those shortly. (wanted the issue number set in stone first...:D)

We have a CVE for this issue: [CVE-2018-7750](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-232r-66cg-79px "CVE-2018-7750").

## Intro

Email from one Matthijs Kooijman ([@matthijskooijman](https://github.com/matthijskooijman/)) dated 2018.03.02 notes that Paramiko's server implementation may be connected to by clients that do not implement the auth step, and happily serves up commands/etc to such un-authed clients. He found that AsyncSSH (another Python lib that does not use Paramiko) has the same issue. Finally, he states the RFC is unclear as to whether this is purposeful.

Let's double check both the RFCs and then our favorite reference implementation, OpenSSH.

Should neither provide a useful clue, my gut says the server implementation should track whether we've sent `SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_SUCCESS` (99% sure we already do track this) and default to rejecting any connection-level messages (like `SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_OPEN` or `SSH_MSG_GLOBAL_REQUEST`) unless that flag is True.

## RFC scan

tl;dr it is indeed kinda vague, there are two kinda-disagreeing undercurrents, neither of which are ironclad:

* It is *assumed* that the connection protocol (which is where command exec occurs) runs on top of / after setting up, the transport (initial kex/handshake/etc) and auth (user auth) protocols.
* The specific server implementation, and/or operator of an instantiation of such an implementation, has *significant leeway* in how they implement and/or configure the server, re: when and how user-auth occurs.

Specifics:

* RFC 4251 (protocol arch)

  + [1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4251#section-1): pretty clear that the intent is that a user auth step always occurs, followed by a service request:

    > The client sends a service request once a secure transport layer
    >
    > connection has been established. A second service request is sent after
    >
    > user authentication is complete.
  + [4.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4251#section-4.3): third bullet point re: policy issues that 'SHOULD' be addressed, highlights that auth specifics are up to the site/operator:

    > The authentication methods that are to be required by the server for
    >
    > each user. The server's policy MAY require multiple authentication for
    >
    > some or all users. The required algorithms MAY depend on the location
    >
    > from where the user is trying to gain access.
  + [9.4.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4251.html#section-9.4.3): this whole section arguably applies, but it's very vague. However it *seems* to back up my hunch that at core, this is up to the server implementer and/or operator, e.g:

    > At the discretion of the implementers, this default policy may be along
    >
    > the lines of anything-goes where there are no restrictions placed upon
    >
    > users [...]
* RFC 4252 (auth protocol)

  + [4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4252.html#section-4): more vague implications that the server can do whatever it wants, e.g. the below quote about `none` auth implies the authors at least partly considered servers that intentionally don't care about auth at all (though the specific discussion is about the actual, explicit use of the `none` auth type message, which is distinct from "did not submit auth at all"):

    > The "none" method is reserved, and MUST NOT be listed as supported.
    >
    > However, it MAY be sent by the client. The server MUST always reject
    >
    > this request, unless the client is to be granted access without any
    >
    > authentication, in which case, the server MUST accept this request.
  + [5.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4252.html#section-5.3): this (like 4251.1) states that the server should start up the requested service after sending auth-success. One could read this to imply that services SHOULD NOT start UNLESS auth has occurred, but it's not explicit...
  + [7](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4252.html#section-7): notes that implementations MUST implement public-key auth, though I note this is distinct from requiring that it is *enabled* (clearly, many real servers only offer password auth, for example.)
* RFC 4253 (transport protocol)

  + [10](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4253.html#section-10): implies client may request "a service" after initial (high level) kex, where that service is one of userauth or connection. The transport level of the protocol thus doesn't appear to actually care or enforce that one performs auth before connection.
* RFC 4254 (connection protocol)

  + [1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4254.html#section-1): once again implies that connection is "designed to" occur after/on top of auth.
  + [11](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4254.html#section-11): again, it's 'assumed':

    > This protocol is assumed to run on top of a secure, authenticated
    >
    > transport. User authentication and protection against network-level
    >
    > attacks are assumed to be provided by the underlying protocols.

## OpenSSH's implementation

My old friend and the only C codebase I have any familiarity with whatsoever, [openssh-portable](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable)...

### Synopsis

After all the below, the tl;dr seems to be:

* OpenSSH sets up a dispatch table to determine how it responds to protocol messages/packets
* This table gets reinitialized depending on 'phase' of execution: while awaiting auth, it is only set to respond to auth-related messages, then after successful auth, it retools the table to only respond to post-auth-related messages like channel opens.
* Thus, the case under test ends up being a simple "What even are you talking about? What's a channel open?" `NotImplementedError` style situation - no auth step, no idea how to handle anything beyond auth.

### Deep dive

* Main SSH2 server loop is `serverloop.c` -> `server_loop2()`
* Which uses a dispatch table to handle inbound messages: <https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/71e48bc7945f867029e50e06c665c66aed6d3c64/serverloop.c#L393>
* Which dispatches to other functions, so when it sees eg `MSG_CHANNEL_OPEN` it calls `server_input_channel_open()`: <https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/71e48bc7945f867029e50e06c665c66aed6d3c64/serverloop.c#L897>
* Which is defined here: <https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/71e48bc7945f867029e50e06c665c66aed6d3c64/serverloop.c#L613>
* If the user is asking for command exec, that's channel type `session`: <https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/71e48bc7945f867029e50e06c665c66aed6d3c64/serverloop.c#L630>
* Which calls `server_request_session`: <https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/71e48bc7945f867029e50e06c665c66aed6d3c64/serverloop.c#L582>
* Which calls `session_open` with a handle on `the_authctxt`: <https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/71e48bc7945f867029e50e06c665c66aed6d3c64/serverloop.c#L603>
  + This is our first apparent reference to anything auth-related so far...
  + The only other apparent external context is the `ssh` object used to get the actual channel in play on the call prior: <https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/71e48bc7945f867029e50e06c665c66aed6d3c64/serverloop.c#L600>
  + That auth context object is `extern`'d at top of file: <https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/71e48bc7945f867029e50e06c665c66aed6d3c64/serverloop.c#L84>
  + We'll dig into that later if necessary but for now, let's assume it has handy ways of telling whether the user is authed or not, and the question is whether/how those are consulted.
* `session_open` is, bizarrely, defined in `session.c`: <https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/de1920d743d295f50e6905e5957c4172c038e8eb/session.c#L1757>
* It checks for `authctxt->valid` (or a null password entry) and gets mad if not true: <https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/de1920d743d295f50e6905e5957c4172c038e8eb/session.c#L1767>
  + So yea, we gotta doublecheck what that `->valid` member actually maps to.
* `Authctxt` struct is defined in `auth.h` here: <https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/71e48bc7945f867029e50e06c665c66aed6d3c64/auth.h#L55-L98>
  + It has a bunch of flags, of which `success`, `authenticated`, and `valid` all seem relevant.
  + `success` is not documented; `authenticated` sounds like it maps to, well, authentication (user is who they claim to be) with `valid` mapping to (a generic level of) authorization (the user is actually allowed to login.)
* Those flags (esp `valid`) aren't set in too many places; the most useful and in retrospect most obvious place is in handling of userauth requests: <https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/71e48bc7945f867029e50e06c665c66aed6d3c64/auth2.c#L215>
  + The core of this is actually use of `Authmethod` structs ([format defined here](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/71e48bc7945f867029e50e06c665c66aed6d3c64/auth.h#L107-L111)) created by the various `auth2-*` modules (one for each implemented auth backend - kerberos, password, publickey, hostbased, etc)
    - These are simple `name`, `userauth`, `enabled` structures, with `userauth` being a pointer to an implementation function (so e.g. the one for password auth is referencing `userauth_passwd` in `auth2-passwd.c` ([here](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/71e48bc7945f867029e50e06c665c66aed6d3c64/auth2-passwd.c#L51-L71).)
  + The per-method `userauth` func is called and the result stored as `authenticated` var: <https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/71e48bc7945f867029e50e06c665c66aed6d3c64/auth2.c#L287>
  + Which bubbles down (after much state machine checking) to finalizing userauth - sending the success network message, updating `authctxt->success = 1`, etc: <https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/71e48bc7945f867029e50e06c665c66aed6d3c64/auth2.c#L352-L360>
* The `->valid` flag seems to actually just be "is the requested username a valid local system user": <https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/71e48bc7945f867029e50e06c665c66aed6d3c64/auth2.c#L236-L239>
  + Note use of `getpwnamallow`, which (basically) wraps the syscall `getpwnam` aka "get password entry for user" (so `authctxt->pw` is specifically that structure and not just a password)
  + Which explains why it's distinct from `success` and `authenticated`.

### Initial distillation

* Seems at first that "huh, the user can get a session as long as they exist locally, without necessarily passing auth" which would be bad but would also act like Paramiko.
* However, realized: that `->valid` flag is set by `input_userauth_request`, meaning the client has to actually submit auth in order to set it. (Ditto `->pw`.)
* So if a user attempts to send a channel open request without authing, both `authctxt->pw` and `authctxt->valid` will be null, and thus `session_open` should call [line 1767](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/de1920d743d295f50e6905e5957c4172c038e8eb/session.c#L1767) and thus result in `fatal("no user for session")`.

### Testing with live OpenSSH server

Proving this with a live install is interesting:

* Ran local docker container executing Ubuntu + OpenSSH 7.2 on port 2222 with nothing but root password auth by default
* Executed Matthijs's `client-test.py` with nothing but the port number changed
* Did not get expected `no user for session` but instead seem to have just confused the poor thing:

  ```
  debug1: SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS received [preauth]
  debug1: KEX done [preauth]
  dispatch_protocol_error: type 90 seq 3 [preauth]
  debug1: Received SSH2_MSG_UNIMPLEMENTED for 3 [preauth]

  ```

### Second dive

* The above protocol error log message comes out of here: <https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/151c6e433a5f5af761c78de87d7b5d30a453cf5e/dispatch.c#L45-L46> in `dispatch_protocol_error()`
* Which is stuffed into newly initialized dispatch tables by [ssh\_dispatch\_init](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/151c6e433a5f5af761c78de87d7b5d30a453cf5e/dispatch.c#L61-L67)
  + Which is done via `do_authentication2` here: <https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/de1920d743d295f50e6905e5957c4172c038e8eb/auth2.c#L172>
* So the tl;dr is that the dispatch table gets all 255 slots filled initially by `SSH2_MSG_UNIMPLEMENTED`, then the table is filled in with what is intended to be responded to (e.g. in `do_authentication2`, the very next line is to say ["ok and now respond to service requests"](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/de1920d743d295f50e6905e5957c4172c038e8eb/auth2.c#L173))
  + E.g. slot 90 corresponds to `SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_OPEN`, aka what our test client was requesting: <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4250#section-4.1.2>
* Looks like in the normal flow of things, the post-auth process ends up reinitializing the dispatch table with acceptable messages (including channel opens):
  + Server loop emits "Entering interactive session" log message one can see in a successful regular auth+shell: <https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/de1920d743d295f50e6905e5957c4172c038e8eb/serverloop.c#L375>
  + Then calls `server_init_dispatch`: <https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/de1920d743d295f50e6905e5957c4172c038e8eb/serverloop.c#L393>
  + Which does aforementioned dispatch reset & fill-in: <https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/de1920d743d295f50e6905e5957c4172c038e8eb/serverloop.c#L889-L910>

## End result

* The RFC isn't terrifically clear beyond "well, we kind of assume you're not gonna open channels and such unless you've already authed", but it's not a `SHOULD` or a `MUST`.
* OpenSSH has chosen to implement this as a strict "only respond to the messages you can handle at the current stage" setup, where auth comes before connection (as in the RFC.) Trying to do things out-of-order results in a simple `SSH_MSG_UNIMPLEMENTED`.
* Paramiko does not do things quite that way: instead, as one might guess from the bug description, it simply sets up all possible dispatch targets (anything implemented by the Transport across its two handler tables, and the AuthHandler handler table) and then dispatches depending on message type:

Doing nothing certainly seems like a bad idea: this is clearly a massive security flaw, and the only reason I did all the above investigation is because software has an irritating history of "but I was *relying* on that bug / looseness in the spec / whatever!". Given the main reference implementation disallows it, I'm inclined to assume nobody could possibly rely on this.

So there's two obvious fixes for Paramiko:

* The "OpenSSH is the Bible" approach: update Transport's dispatching to be more like OpenSSH's and only enable certain message types depending on the state of `self.is_authenticated` (which, impressively, appears to only ever be used in `__repr__`...!!!)
  + This could be problematic given that Transport is frustratingly bimodal and is used both for server *and* client operations - we'd have to make sure that we're not preventing a not-yet-authed client from dispatching on necessary responses because it's not authed yet, for example.
  + Of note, AsyncSSH is taking this approach in their fix, and are simply leveraging the fact that RFC 4250 compatible protocol numbers mean one can just go "is the message identifier greater than the highest possible auth related number? Are you authed yet? No? Screw off!" - seems possible on our end, though doesn't really change the previous point about ensuring client-side cases are protected.
* The "that's too much work right now" approach: simply rub some more references to `.auth_handler` and/or `.is_authenticated` in specific spots such as `Server.check_channel_request` ([here](https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/blob/master/paramiko/server.py#L42))
  + Except this, too, is problematic because of how Transport, Server and AuthHandler split up responsibilities & exposures to one another. By default a Server has no direct access to the Transport running it, or that Transport's AuthHandler (which, in server mode, is set up during rekeying [including initial kex].)
    - Changing this would be backwards incompatible (e.g. enforcing an actual `__init__` on `Server` subclasses for the passing-in of a reference to one of the other objects, since right now `Server` doesn't even define one!) though I would like to examine it sometime. Now probably not the best time though.
  + Could still put specific, small-scoped changes in `Transport` though, such as around the `check_channel_request` calls here:

    [paramiko/paramiko/transport.py](https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/blob/27a8ed14c2f3e7a1fd8e75d259f06504d5c8e11b/paramiko/transport.py#L2531-L2537)

    Lines 2531 to 2537
    in
    [27a8ed1](/paramiko/paramiko/commit/27a8ed14c2f3e7a1fd8e75d259f06504d5c8e11b)

    |  | reason = self.server\_object.check\_channel\_direct\_tcpip\_request( |
    | --- | --- |
    |  | my\_chanid, |
    |  | (origin\_addr, origin\_port), |
    |  | (dest\_addr, dest\_port) |
    |  | ) |
    |  | else: |
    |  | reason = self.server\_object.check\_channel\_request( |

My gut says to take a quick stab at the 1st approach but to fall back to the

2nd if the 1st cannot be done relatively painlessly.

Either way, re: the actual action to take seems poorly defined, but esp given OpenSSH simply spits out a bunch of question marks and not a "useful" error; the RFCs (4250, 4254) list only 4 default 'error' types, of which `OPEN_FAILED_ADMINISTRATIVELY_PROHIBITED` seems the closest fit. And indeed Paramiko uses it for eg bogus channel types, in some legacy tests.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Topic

An update for python-paramiko is now available for Red Hat Ansible Engine 2.4 for RHEL 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Low. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The python-paramiko package provides a Python module that implements the SSH2 protocol for encrypted and authenticated connections to remote machines. Unlike SSL, the SSH2 protocol does not require hierarchical certificates signed by a powerful central authority. The protocol also includes the ability to open arbitrary channels to remote services across an encrypted tunnel.

Package        : paramiko
Version        : 1.15.1-1+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-7750 CVE-2018-1000805

CVE-2018-1000805
     Fix to prevent malicious clients to trick the Paramiko server into
     thinking an unauthenticated client is authenticated.

CVE-2018-7750
     Fix check whether authentication is completed before processing
     other requests. A customized SSH client can simply skip the
     authentication step.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1.15.1-1+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your paramiko packages.

With new versions of python2-cryptography, python2-pyasn1 was not getting installed and this caused python-paramiko to malfunction. This bug was fixed by making python-paramiko depend on python2-pyasn1 explicitly. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2018-05-02 13:10:16 UTC | | | oVirt Team: | Integration | | | Target Upstream Version: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A1525)

## Topic

An update for rhvm-appliance is now available for Red Hat Virtualization 4 for RHEL-7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The RHV-M Virtual Appliance automates the process of installing and configuring the Red Hat Virtualization Manager. The appliance is available to download as an OVA file from the Customer Portal.

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: rhvm-appliance (4.2). (BZ#1558801, BZ#1563545)

Security Fix(es):

* python-paramiko: Authentication bypass in transport.py (CVE-2018-7750)
* slf4j: Deserialisation vulnerability in EventData constructor can allow for arbitrary code execution (CVE-2018-8088)
* undertow: Client can use bogus uri in Digest authentication (CVE-2017-12196)
* jackson-databind: unsafe deserialization due to incomplete blacklist (incomplete fix for CVE-2017-7525 and CVE-2017-17485) (CVE-2018-5968)
* ovirt-engine: account enumeration through login to web console (CVE-2018-1073)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Chris McCown for reporting CVE-2018-8088. The CVE-2017-12196 issue was discovered by Jan Stourac (Red Hat).

Enhancement(s):

* Previously, the default memory allotment for the RHV-M Virtual Appliance was always large enough to include support for user additions.

In this release, the RHV-M Virtual Appliance includes a swap partition that enables the memory to be increased when required. (BZ#1422982)

* Previously, the partitioning scheme for the RHV-M Virtual Appliance included two primary partitions, "/" and swap.

In this release, the disk partitioning scheme has been modified to match the scheme specified by NIST. The updated disk partitions are as follows:

/boot 1G (primary)
/home 1G (lvm)
/tmp 2G (lvm)
/var 20G (lvm)
/var/log 10G (lvm)
/var/log/audit 1G (lvm)
swap 8G (lvm)
/ 6G (primary) (BZ#1463853)

* Previously, the version tag was used as part of the RPM's naming scheme, for example, "4.1.timestamp", which created differences between the upstream and downstream versioning schemes. In this release, the downstream versioning scheme is aligned with the upstream scheme and the timestamp has moved from the version tag to the release tag. (BZ#1464486)

## Solution

# USN-3603-1: Paramiko vulnerability

20 March 2018

Paramiko could be made to run programs if it received specially
crafted network traffic.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [paramiko](/security/cves?package=paramiko) - Python SSH2 library

## Details

Matthijs Kooijman discovered that Paramiko's SSH server implementation

did not properly require authentication before processing requests. An

unauthenticated remote attacker could possibly use this to execute

arbitrary code.

After adding swap, 58gb is correct.  The OVA was updated. Please try a CLI deploy withe same appliance, and it should now also reflect 58gb   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1561888#c8)  Nikolai Sednev    2018-04-09 11:18:27 UTC  ``` This is the message that being received during deployment over 70GB iSCSI LUN from Cockpit: [ ERROR ] fatal: [localhost]: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "msg": "Error: the target storage domain contains only 64.0GiB of available space while a minimum of 68.0GiB is required"}  And this is what I've got from CLI for the same 70GB LUN: [ ERROR ] fatal: [localhost]: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "msg": "Error: the target storage domain contains only 64.0GiB of available space while a minimum of 68.0GiB is required"}  Deployment over NFS on 58GB from Cockpit was also accepted now.  Tested on: cockpit-ovirt-dashboard-0.11.20-1.el7ev.noarch ovirt-hosted-engine-setup-2.2.16-1.el7ev.noarch ovirt-hosted-engine-ha-2.2.10-1.el7ev.noarch rhvm-appliance-4.2-20180404.0.el7.noarch Linux 3.10.0-862.el7.x86_64 #1 SMP Wed Mar 21 18:14:51 EDT 2018 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 7.5 (Maipo)  Works for me the same for both CLI and Cockpit, during deployment phase.  Ryan, please provide your input about this data: The thing here is that "a minimum of 68.0GiB is required", does not take in account the 6GB of metadata, hence, IMHO, message should properly inform customers, that deployment requires 6GB for metadata and minimum of 68GB for the deployment, hence actual minimal LUN space should be at least 74GB (68+6=74).  I think that message here can be refined, so customers will provide proper LUN space. Just in case, I've tested deployment with 74GB of raw LUN's space and deployment proceeded farther, so 74GB of raw LUN's space is the minimum for the deployment over iSCSI.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1561888#c9)  Ryan Barry    2018-04-09 12:35:04 UTC  ``` I think there are two things we can do here, Nikolai, but both happen on the ovirt-hosted-engine-side.  The first is to update the documentation and the message to essentially be ${size_of_image}+10% (to account for metadata)  The other, which we probably don't want to do, is to remove the metadata reserved space on the LV.  Simone, can we update the message to add 10%?   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1561888#c10)  Simone Tiraboschi    2018-04-09 13:17:29 UTC  ``` (In reply to Ryan Barry from [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=1561888#c9)) > Simone, can we update the message to add 10%?  This is not that accurate. On a 2TB we are not going to have a 200Gb overhead.  We are creating a SD from the engine and it adds some overhead here but we cannot really forecast how much on hosted-engine-setup side.

There is some confusion here with units. install asks for engine size in GB, but creates the lv in GiB. My NAS vendor does the same thing.  I created what I thought was a 74GB volume, but fdisk on the connected LUN reports 79.5 GB.   After the install, lvm2 report [73.62 GiB / 7.50 GiB free], so 74 GiB not only seems to be enough, but more than enough (unless some temporary lvs for 7.5 GiB are created and deleted during the process).   I'll file a separate bug for the incorrect units in the install question.   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1561888#c25)  Nikolai Sednev    2018-05-15 03:45:21 UTC  ``` 1GB(Gigabyte)=10^9=1 000 000 000 000 in decimal value. 1GiB(Gibibyte)=2^30=1 073 741 824 in binary value. So 74GB=68.9179GiB  My storage vendor and also in FreeNAS provide this in GB as for storage units and I've used 74 decimal value.  When referring to computer memory, gigabyte is always a “power of two” - 1,073,741,824 bytes, but when measuring hard drive capacity it is often defined as 1,000,000,000 bytes. OS calculates disk and file sizes using binary numbers, so a new 500 GB drive you've just purchased would be reported by the OS as "465.66 GB" (meaning 465.66 GiB).  I'm not sure where is a bug here exactly.   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=1561888#c28)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-05-15 19:00:03 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A1274)

## Topic

An update for python-paramiko is now available for Red Hat Virtualization 4 Management Agent for RHEL 7 and Red Hat Virtualization Manager 4.1.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Low. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The python-paramiko package provides a Python module that implements the SSH2 protocol for encrypted and authenticated connections to remote machines. Unlike SSL, the SSH2 protocol does not require hierarchical certificates signed by a powerful central authority. The protocol also includes the ability to open arbitrary channels to remote services across an encrypted tunnel.

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: python-paramiko (2.1.1). (BZ#1562393)

Security Fix(es):

* python-paramiko: Authentication bypass in transport.py (CVE-2018-7750)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

# RHSA-2018:0591 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Critical: python-paramiko security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A0591)

## Topic

An update for python-paramiko is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Critical. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The python-paramiko package provides a Python module that implements the SSH2 protocol for encrypted and authenticated connections to remote machines. Unlike SSL, the SSH2 protocol does not require hierarchical certificates signed by a powerful central authority. The protocol also includes the ability to open arbitrary channels to remote services across an encrypted tunnel.

Security Fix(es):

* python-paramiko: Authentication bypass in transport.py (CVE-2018-7750)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Bug Fix(es):

* python-paramiko has been using the python2-pyasn1 package, but did not depend on it. With new versions of python2-cryptography, python2-pyasn1 was not getting installed and this caused python-paramiko to malfunction. This bug was fixed by making python-paramiko depend on python2-pyasn1 explicitly. (BZ#1559133)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

## Affected Products

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
