- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An interface within the Huawei smartphone operating system does not properly verify authorization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Inadequate authorization checks on an interface that provides location data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can leverage an application with phone state authorization to obtain the user's location without explicit location authorization, leading to a user's location information being leaked to an unauthorized party.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious application installed on the device, with permission to access phone state information, exploits the vulnerable interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to create a malicious application and convince the user to install it. The application requires the permission to access phone state.
