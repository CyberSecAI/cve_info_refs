Introduction:

I found a script injection vulnerability in the login form language parameter of the ADB firmware being used in numerous VDSL devices sold by ADB and being used by numerous ISPs world-wide including the countries Austria, Israel, Italy, Slovakia, Argentina, Lithuania, Poland and Chile amongst others.

I informed ADB and A1 Telekom Austria about the vulnerability identified in 2017 allowing them to prepare a fix prior to informing the public. As it was confirmed by the two parties that fixes have been rolled out now to all customers in June 2018, I disclose the vulnerability. I have not tested the updates provided by the manufacturer/ISP and therefore can’t comment on its effectivity.
