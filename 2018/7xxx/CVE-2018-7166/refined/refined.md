{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "An argument processing flaw in `Buffer.alloc()` where the third argument, intended for encoding, could be misinterpreted as the start of a fill operation if passed as a number. This leads to the function returning uninitialized memory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unintentional exposure of uninitialized memory"
    ],
    "impact": "Exposure of potentially sensitive information from uncleared memory blocks.",
    "attack_vectors": "By manipulating the arguments passed to the `Buffer.alloc()` function, particularly when those arguments are derived from user input.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to control the arguments passed to `Buffer.alloc()`. This could be a user providing input to a web application or other software utilizing Node.js."
  },
  "affected_versions": [
    "All previous versions of Node.js 10.x (Current)"
  ],
   "additional_notes": "Only Node.js 10 is impacted by this flaw. Versions of Node.js 6.x (LTS \"Boron\") and 8.x (LTS \"Carbon\") are not vulnerable."
