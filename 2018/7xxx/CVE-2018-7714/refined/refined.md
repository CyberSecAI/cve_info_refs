Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7714:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the `validateInputImageSize` function in `modules/imgcodecs/src/loadsave.cpp` of OpenCV 3.4.1. This function checks the validity of input image sizes. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs because the check `(pixels <= (1<<30))` can fail if the number of pixels in an image exceeds this limit.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Assertion Failure:** The code uses a `CV_Assert` which, in OpenCV, is not a standard C assert, but a C++ exception. When the condition `pixels <= (1<<30)` evaluates to false, this exception is raised, leading to program termination.
- **Unchecked Image Dimensions:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of image dimensions, where the pixel count is not adequately checked before processing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a denial of service by providing a specially crafted image with dimensions that lead to `pixels > (1<<30)`, triggering the assertion failure and terminating the program.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The vulnerability can be triggered remotely, as indicated by the "Network" attack vector in the CVSS metrics.
- **Malicious Image Input:** The attacker crafts an image file with specific dimensions designed to cause the assertion to fail during image processing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
- **No User Interaction Required:** The vulnerability can be triggered without any interaction from the user, meaning that simply processing a malicious image can lead to a crash.
- **Remote Position:** The attacker can be in a remote position as the vulnerability can be triggered over the network by providing a malicious input image file to an application using the vulnerable OpenCV library.

**Additional Details:**

- **Disputed CVE:** The vulnerability is marked as "DISPUTED," likely because the "assertion" is treated as a controlled exit, however the impact leads to a denial of service.
- **CWE-617:** The vulnerability is classified under CWE-617, which refers to "Reachable Assertion."

In summary, CVE-2018-7714 allows an attacker to cause a denial of service in applications using the vulnerable OpenCV library by providing a specially crafted image file with large dimensions that cause an assertion failure when the image is processed.
