## Description

\*\* DISPUTED \*\* The validateInputImageSize function in modules/imgcodecs/src/loadsave.cpp in OpenCV 3.4.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure) because (pixels <= (1<<30)) may be false. Note: “OpenCV CV\_Assert is not an assertion (C-like assert()), it is regular C++ exception which can raised in case of invalid or non-supported parameters.”

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

## Description

\*\* DISPUTED \*\* The validateInputImageSize function in modules/imgcodecs/src/loadsave.cpp in OpenCV 3.4.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure) because (size.width <= (1<<20)) may be false. Note: “OpenCV CV\_Assert is not an assertion (C-like assert()), it is regular C++ exception which can raised in case of invalid or non-supported parameters.”

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Description

[![@xiaoqx](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12206619?v=4&size=48)](/xiaoqx)[xiaoqx](https://github.com/xiaoqx)opened [on Mar 6, 2018](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/10998#issue-302577587)

In some cases, an assertion failure may be intentional behavior, not a vulnerability,

However, Assertion failure may cause denial of service attacks in some cases.

And CVE IDs have been assigned such as [CVE-2018-7712](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vh8h-jg54-v92w "CVE-2018-7712"),[CVE-2018-7713](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wj8j-vmwr-jqc9 "CVE-2018-7713"),[CVE-2018-7714](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2862-4mgm-j6fv "CVE-2018-7714").

## Description

\*\* DISPUTED \*\* The validateInputImageSize function in modules/imgcodecs/src/loadsave.cpp in OpenCV 3.4.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure) because (size.height <= (1<<20)) may be false. Note: “OpenCV CV\_Assert is not an assertion (C-like assert()), it is regular C++ exception which can raised in case of invalid or non-supported parameters.”

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
