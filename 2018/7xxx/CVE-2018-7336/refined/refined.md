Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the FCP (Fibre Channel Protocol) dissector within the Wireshark software. A malformed FCP packet can cause a null pointer dereference, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Null pointer dereference:**  The FCP dissector attempts to access memory using a pointer that is unexpectedly null, resulting in a program crash. This indicates a lack of proper error handling or input validation within the dissector.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit will cause Wireshark (specifically tshark in one instance) to crash. This can disrupt network analysis activities by making the tool unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malformed Network Packets:** An attacker can craft a malicious FCP packet and inject it into a network traffic stream.
*  **Malformed Capture Files:** An attacker can create a malicious pcap file with a malformed FCP packet and convince someone to open the file with Wireshark.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** To inject malicious FCP packets onto the wire, the attacker needs to be in a position to intercept or send traffic within the network.
*  **Social Engineering:** To get a user to open a malicious pcap file, an attacker may need to use social engineering.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Otto Airamo and Antti Levom√§ki from Forcepoint.
*   The vulnerability affects Wireshark versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.4 and 2.2.0 to 2.2.12. It is resolved in versions 2.4.5 and 2.2.13.
*   The provided information aligns with the general description of CVE-2018-7336.

The information extracted from the provided documents provides more detail than the CVE description, explaining the root cause as a null pointer dereference in the FCP dissector when handling malformed packets.
