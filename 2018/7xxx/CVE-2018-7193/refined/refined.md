The provided content is related to CVE-2018-7193.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue caused by unsanitized input in the `order` parameter within the `directory.php` script.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected XSS: The application reflects unsanitized user input in the response, allowing for the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser.
- Missing `HttpOnly` flag: The session cookie lacks the `HttpOnly` flag, making it accessible to JavaScript and vulnerable to theft.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution: Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser of a logged-in user.
- Session cookie theft: Due to the missing `HttpOnly` flag, attackers can steal session cookies, potentially leading to account takeover.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious URL: The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `order` parameter and tricks the victim into visiting it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
- The victim must be a signed-in user with access to the Agent panel of the osTicket installation.
