Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7690:

**Summary:**

CVE-2018-7690 describes an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability found in the REST API of Micro Focus Fortify Software Security Center (SSC) versions 17.10, 17.20, and 18.10. This vulnerability allows authenticated users to access unauthorized information.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the insufficient access control checks within the SSC REST API. The application fails to properly verify if an authenticated user has the necessary permissions to access the requested resources. Specifically:

*   **Project Data Exposure:** The API does not validate if a user has the right to access the project data through the `/api/v1/projects/{NUMBER}` endpoint with a GET request.
*   **User Data Exposure:** The API does not validate if a user has the right to access details of local and LDAP users through a POST request (not described in detail)

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The vulnerability is a classic IDOR. The application uses user-supplied input (project IDs) to access data directly without authorization checks. This allows attackers to manipulate these IDs to access resources they shouldn't have access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary impact is the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive project and user information. Specifically:
    *   An attacker can access details of any Fortify project.
    *   An attacker can access details of any user in the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Requests:** An attacker can make GET requests to the vulnerable API endpoint (`/api/v1/projects/{NUMBER}`) by manipulating the `NUMBER` parameter to enumerate project IDs.
*   **HTTP POST Requests:** An attacker can make POST requests to the vulnerable API endpoint to access user data (not described in detail).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be a valid, authenticated user of the Fortify SSC application. A view-only role is sufficient to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the SSC server to send HTTP requests.
*   **Understanding of API Endpoints:** The attacker must know the vulnerable API endpoints and the structure of the requests.
*   **Ability to craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be capable of using tools like `curl` or Burp Suite to craft HTTP requests and inspect responses.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   **Specific Versions Affected**: Fortify SSC versions 17.10, 17.20, and 18.10.
*   **CVSS Score:** The exploit-db entry mentions a CVSS score of 6.5 (Medium; AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) which further indicates impact as High for Confidentiality.
*   **Proof of Concept:** Detailed steps are given to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Timeline:** The provided timeline details the discovery, notification to the vendor, and the public disclosure of the vulnerability.
*   **Mitigation:** The vendor released a patch to fix the vulnerability.

**In summary, CVE-2018-7690 allows authenticated but unauthorized users to access sensitive project information from the Fortify SSC server. This is due to insufficient checks on the user's authorization to access certain resources through the API.**
