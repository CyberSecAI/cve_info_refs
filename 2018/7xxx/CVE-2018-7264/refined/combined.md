**Vulnerable App:**

```
ActivePDF Toolkit < 8.1.0 multiple RCE

Introduction
============
The ActivePDF Toolkit is a Windows library which enhances business
processes to stamp, stitch, merge, form-fill, add digital signatures,
barcodes to PDF. Both .NET and native APIs are provided.  Amongst many
other operations, this library can be used by applications to transform
images to PDF files.

Multiple vulnerabilities were identified in the Pictview image processing
library embedded by the Toolkit and signed by ActivePDF. They could allow
remote attackers to compromise applications relying on the Toolkit to
process untrusted images. Note that, while the example instances hereafter
use “exotic” file types, the parser determines the image type from magic
bytes, ignoring file extensions in most cases.

CVE-2018-7264
=============
ActivePDF Toolkit < 8.1.0.19023 multiple RCE

Summary
-------
An image processing library embedded in the ActivePDF Toolkit product is
prone to multiple BSS out-of-bound and signedess errors which can yield
direct EIP control by overwriting function pointers, error handling
structures or IAT entries. Note that the affected library does not enable
ASLR.

Reproduction
------------
The following scripts can be used to generate crafted image files which
achieve EIP control when parsed or converted by the ActivePDF Toolkit (e.g.
via the ImageToPDF method), through different root causes. These examples
can be reproduced through both the .NET and native APIs and independently
from file extensions, however the .NET layer will hide the native crashes
and return -1. This may crash the library with a lock on, so only use in
test environments.

Remediation
-----------
Upgrade to ActivePDF Toolkit >= 8.1.0 (build 8.1.0.19023), which fixes the
problem by removing the affected image processing library. Note that this
also fixes the similar ZDI-16-354 vulnerability.

For more information and guidance, please contact the ActivePDF support
through their portal (https://support.activepdf.com).

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

ActivePDF Toolkit < 8.1.0 multiple RCE

Introduction
============
The ActivePDF Toolkit is a Windows library which enhances business
processes to stamp, stitch, merge, form-fill, add digital signatures,
barcodes to PDF. Both .NET and native APIs are provided.  Amongst many
other operations, this library can be used by applications to transform
images to PDF files.

Multiple vulnerabilities were identified in the Pictview image processing
library embedded by the Toolkit and signed by ActivePDF. They could allow
remote attackers to compromise applications relying on the Toolkit to
process untrusted images. Note that, while the example instances hereafter
use “exotic” file types, the parser determines the image type from magic
bytes, ignoring file extensions in most cases.

CVE-2018-7264
=============
ActivePDF Toolkit < 8.1.0.19023 multiple RCE

Summary
-------
An image processing library embedded in the ActivePDF Toolkit product is
prone to multiple BSS out-of-bound and signedess errors which can yield
direct EIP control by overwriting function pointers, error handling
structures or IAT entries. Note that the affected library does not enable
ASLR.

Reproduction
------------
The following scripts can be used to generate crafted image files which
achieve EIP control when parsed or converted by the ActivePDF Toolkit (e.g.
via the ImageToPDF method), through different root causes. These examples
can be reproduced through both the .NET and native APIs and independently
from file extensions, however the .NET layer will hide the native crashes
and return -1. This may crash the library with a lock on, so only use in
test environments.

Remediation
-----------
Upgrade to ActivePDF Toolkit >= 8.1.0 (build 8.1.0.19023), which fixes the
problem by removing the affected image processing library. Note that this
also fixes the similar ZDI-16-354 vulnerability.

For more information and guidance, please contact the ActivePDF support
through their portal (<https://support.activepdf.com>).
