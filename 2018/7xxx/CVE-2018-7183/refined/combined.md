## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 342 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2788740.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [ntp](/security/cves?package=ntp) - Network Time Protocol daemon and utility programs

## Details

USN-3707-1 and USN-3349-1 fixed several vulnerabilities in NTP. This update

provides the corresponding update for Ubuntu 12.04 ESM.

Original advisory details:

Miroslav Lichvar discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain spoofed

addresses when performing rate limiting. A remote attacker could possibly

use this issue to perform a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-7426](/security/CVE-2016-7426))

Matthew Van Gundy discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain crafted

broadcast mode packets. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to

perform a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-7427](/security/CVE-2016-7427), [CVE-2016-7428](/security/CVE-2016-7428))

Matthew Van Gundy discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain control

mode packets. A remote attacker could use this issue to set or unset traps.

([CVE-2016-9310](/security/CVE-2016-9310))

Matthew Van Gundy discovered that NTP incorrectly handled the trap service.

A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to crash, resulting

in a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-9311](/security/CVE-2016-9311))

It was discovered that the NTP legacy DPTS refclock driver incorrectly handled

the /dev/datum device. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to cause

a denial of service. ([CVE-2017-6462](/security/CVE-2017-6462))

It was discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain invalid settings in a

:config directive. A remote authenticated user could possibly use this issue

to cause NTP to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2017-6463](/security/CVE-2017-6463))

Michael Macnair discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain responses.

A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-7183](/security/CVE-2018-7183))

Miroslav Lichvar discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain

zero-origin timestamps. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to

cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-7185](/security/CVE-2018-7185))

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [ntp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/ntp)
  -
  [1:4.2.6.p3+dfsg-1ubuntu3.12](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/ntp/1%3A4.2.6.p3%2Bdfsg-1ubuntu3.12)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

**Detail**

* CVE-2018-7185

  + Severity: Low
  + CVSS3 Base Score: 3.1
  + CVSS3 Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)
  + The protocol engine in ntp 4.2.6 before 4.2.8p11 allows a remote attackers to cause a denial of service (disruption) by continually sending a packet with a zero-origin timestamp and source IP address of the "other side" of an interleaved association causing the victim ntpd to reset its association.
* CVE-2018-7184

  + Severity: Low
  + CVSS3 Base Score: 3.1
  + CVSS3 Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)
  + ntpd in ntp 4.2.8p4 before 4.2.8p11 drops bad packets before updating the "received" timestamp, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (disruption) by sending a packet with a zero-origin timestamp causing the association to reset and setting the contents of the packet as the most recent timestamp. This issue is a result of an incomplete fix for CVE-2015-7704.
* CVE-2018-7170

  + Severity: Low
  + CVSS3 Base Score: 3.1
  + CVSS3 Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)
  + ntpd in ntp 4.2.x before 4.2.8p7 and 4.3.x before 4.3.92 allows authenticated users that know the private symmetric key to create arbitrarily-many ephemeral associations in order to win the clock selection of ntpd and modify a victim's clock via a Sybil attack. This issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-1549.
* CVE-2018-7183

  + Severity: Moderate
  + CVSS3 Base Score: 5.0
  + CVSS3 Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)
  + Buffer overflow in the decodearr function in ntpq in ntp 4.2.8p6 through 4.2.8p10 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by leveraging an ntpq query and sending a response with a crafted array.
* CVE-2018-7182

  + Severity: Moderate
  + CVSS3 Base Score: 5.3
  + CVSS3 Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)
  + The ctl\_getitem method in ntpd in ntp-4.2.8p6 before 4.2.8p11 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via a crafted mode 6 packet with a ntpd instance from 4.2.8p6 through 4.2.8p10.
* CVE-2016-1549

  + Severity: Moderate
  + CVSS3 Base Score: 5.3
  + CVSS3 Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N)
  + A malicious authenticated peer can create arbitrarily-many ephemeral associations in order to win the clock selection algorithm in ntpd in NTP 4.2.8p4 and earlier and NTPsec 3e160db8dc248a0bcb053b56a80167dc742d2b74 and a5fb34b9cc89b92a8fef2f459004865c93bb7f92 and modify a victim's clock.

#### Description

`ntpq` is a monitoring and control program for `ntpd`. `decodearr()` is an internal function of `ntpq` that is used to – wait for it – decode an array in a response string when formatted data is being displayed. This is a problem in affected versions of `ntpq` if a maliciously-altered `ntpd` returns an array result that will trip this bug, or if a bad actor is able to read an `ntpq` request on its way to a remote `ntpd` server and forge and send a response before the remote `ntpd` sends its response. It’s potentially possible that the malicious data could become injectable/executable code.

---

#### Mitigation

* Implement [BCP-38](http://www.bcp38.info/index.php/Main_Page).
* Upgrade to [ntp-4.2.8p11 or later.](https://downloads.nwtime.org/ntp/4.2.8/)

# Security

##### Notification Policy

When we discover a security vulnerability in NTP we follow our Phased Vulnerability Process which includes first notifying Institutional members of the [NTP Consortium at Network Time Foundation](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/), then [CERT](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/divisions/cert/index.cfm), and finally making a public announcement.

[Institutional Members](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/#institutional-consortia-memberships) receive advanced notification of security vulnerabilities.

##### Security Patch Policy

When security patches are ready, they are first given to Premier and Partner Institutional members of the [NTP Consortium at Network Time Foundation](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/), then access instructions are provided to [CERT](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/divisions/cert/index.cfm), and finally the public release is made on the embargo date.

[Premier and Partner Members](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/#institutional-consortia-memberships) receive early access to security patches.

##### Reporting Security Issues

If you find a security vulnerability in the NTP codebase, please report it by **PGP-encrypted** email to the NTF Security Officer Team. You can use our [NTF Security Officer PGP Key](https://www.nwtime.org/about/documents/NTFSecurityOfficerPGPKey.txt). Please refrain from discussing potential security issues in any mailing lists or public forums.

**NOTE:** Non-code vulnerabilities (such as a website issue) should instead be reported to webmaster. Issues for subdomains of "pool.ntp.org" should be reported to the [NTP Pool Project](https://www.ntppool.org/en/mailinglists.html).

Topic: Multiple vulnerabilities of ntp
Category: contrib
Module: ntp
Announced: 2018-03-07

CVE Name: CVE-2018-7182, CVE-2018-7170, CVE-2018-7184, CVE-2018-7185,
CVE-2018-7183
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
The ntpd(8) daemon is an implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP)
used to synchronize the time of a computer system to a reference time
source.
II. Problem Description
The ctl\_getitem() function is used by ntpd(8) to process incoming "mode 6"
packets. A malicious "mode 6" packet can be sent to an ntpd instance, and
if the ntpd instance is from 4.2.8p6 through 4.2.8p10, ctl\_getitem() will
read past the end of its buffer. [CVE-2018-7182]
The ntpd(8) service can be vulnerable to Sybil attacks. If a system is
configured to use a trustedkey and if one is not using the feature introduced
in ntp-4.2.8p6 allowing an optional 4th field in the ntp.keys file to specify
which IPs can serve time, a malicious authenticated peer, i.e., one where the
attacker knows the private symmetric key, can create arbitrarily-many
ephemeral associations in order to win the clock selection of ntpd and modify
a victim's clock. [CVE-2018-7170]
The fix for NtpBug2952 was incomplete, and while it fixed one problem it
created another. Specifically, it drops bad packets before updating the
"received" timestamp. This means a third-party can inject a packet with
a zero-origin timestamp, meaning the sender wants to reset the association,
and the transmit timestamp in this bogus packet will be saved as the most
recent "received" timestamp. The real remote peer does not know this
value and this will disrupt the association until the association resets.
[CVE-2018-7184]
The NTP Protocol allows for both non-authenticated and authenticated
associations, in client/server, symmetric (peer), and several broadcast
modes. In addition to the basic NTP operational modes, symmetric mode and
broadcast servers can support an interleaved mode of operation. In
ntp-4.2.8p4, a bug was inadvertently introduced into the protocol engine that
allows a non-authenticated zero-origin (reset) packet to reset an
authenticated interleaved peer association. If an attacker can send a packet
with a zero-origin timestamp and the source IP address of the "other side" of
an interleaved association, the 'victim' ntpd will reset its association.
The attacker must continue sending these packets in order to maintain the
disruption of the association. [CVE-2018-7185]
The ntpq(8) utility is a monitoring and control program for ntpd. The
internal decodearr() function of ntpq(8) that is used to decode an array in
a response string when formatted data is being displayed. This is a problem
in affected versions of ntpq if a maliciously-altered ntpd returns an array
result that will trip this bug, or if a bad actor is able to read an ntpq(8)
request on its way to a remote ntpd server and forge and send a response
before the remote ntpd sends its response. It is potentially possible that
the malicious data could become injectable/executable code. [CVE-2017-7183]
III. Impact
Malicious remote attackers may be able to break time synchornization,
or cause the ntpq(8) utility to crash.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available, but systems not running ntpd(8) or ntpq(8) are
not affected. Network administrators are advised to implement BCP-38 which
helps to reduce risk associated with the attacks.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
The ntpd service has to be restarted after the update. A reboot is
recommended but not required.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
The ntpd service has to be restarted after the update. A reboot is
recommended but not required.
3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
[FreeBSD 11.1]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-18:02/ntp-11.1.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-18:02/ntp-11.1.patch.asc
# gpg --verify ntp-11.1.patch.asc
[FreeBSD 10.4]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-18:02/ntp-10.4.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-18:02/ntp-10.4.patch.asc
# gpg --verify ntp-10.4.patch.asc
[FreeBSD 10.3]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-18:02/ntp-10.3.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-18:02/ntp-10.3.patch.asc
# gpg --verify ntp-10.3.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in .
Restart the applicable daemons, or reboot the system.
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.
