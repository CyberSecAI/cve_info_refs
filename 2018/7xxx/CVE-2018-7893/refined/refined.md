Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7893:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `metadata` parameter within the `admin/moduleinterface.php` file of CMS Made Simple (CMSMS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to sanitize the `metadata` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are then stored in the system and executed when a user views the affected page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the system. This could lead to:
  - **Account takeover:** Stealing session cookies or credentials of other users, including administrators.
  - **Data theft:** Accessing sensitive information displayed on the affected pages.
  - **Malware distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or injecting malware.
  - **Defacement:** Altering the content of the website.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker sends a crafted POST request to `admin/moduleinterface.php` with malicious JavaScript within the `metadata` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to access the CMSMS admin interface, requiring authentication. This implies the attacker may already have compromised administrative credentials or is a malicious insider with privileges.
