Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7493:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the privileged helper tool of the CactusVPN application for macOS. Specifically, the helper tool implements an XPC (Inter-Process Communication) interface insecurely.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure XPC Interface:** The core vulnerability is that the XPC interface allows any application on the system to communicate with the privileged helper tool. This allows unprivileged applications to send arbitrary commands.
- **Unrestricted Command Execution:** The XPC interface does not properly validate or sanitize the commands it receives, resulting in the ability to execute arbitrary system commands with root privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Root Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain root privileges on the affected macOS system.
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Attackers can execute any command on the system, enabling them to potentially install malware, modify system settings, or access sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Exploitation:** An attacker must have local access to the macOS system to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Arbitrary Application:** The attacker can leverage any application they control (or craft a malicious one) to interact with the vulnerable XPC interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target macOS system.
- **Ability to Send XPC Messages:** The attacker needs to be able to send XPC messages to the vulnerable helper tool. This is generally possible from any application, including malicious ones the attacker could create.
