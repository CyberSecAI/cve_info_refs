**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Directory traversal vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can read arbitrary OS files on the affected system. The vulnerability was used to achieve full compromise of the appliance.

**Attack vectors:**
Remote exploitation via HTTP requests to the web server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected device on port 8088.
The attacker does not need prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
