Yii Framework News

Mar 20, 2018
## [Releasing Yii 2.0.15 and database extensions with security fixes](/news/168/releasing-yii-2-0-15-and-database-extensions-with-security-fixes)

Today we are releasing several versions for Yii 2.0.x and official extensions to fix a security issue.

The problem addressed in these patches exists in ActiveRecord shortcut methods `findOne()` and `findAll()`, which may
allow [SQL injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection) if input is not prepared properly. We consider this as a security issue in Yii because the documentation for these methods did not contain an explicit warning that there are cases when passing unfiltered user input might be dangerous. Thanks to [analitic1983](https://github.com/analitic1983) for making us aware of the issue.

The nature of this issue does not solely exists in the Yii Framework but depends on how an application uses Yii.
We have changed Yii to be more robust against the worst impact of the problem (SQL injection), but applications may still be vulnerable
and changes to application code are necessary in some cases. As a safety measure, `findOne()` and `findAll()` are now limited to filter on
columns that are AR properties only. In the following we will explain the problem in more detail
and show which application code is affected and what needs to be adjusted on upgrade.

For discussion on this issue, [there is a forum topic](http://www.yiiframework.com/forum/index.php/topic/76661-releasing-yii-2015-and-database-extensions-with-security-fixes/).

### Summary of Affected Classes, Methods and Composer Packages [¶](#summary-of-affected-classes-methods-and-composer-packages)

1. [Not Affected Code](#not-affected-code)
2. [Affected Code](#affected-code)

* `yii\db\ActiveRecord::findOne()` and `yii\db\ActiveRecord::findAll()` in `yiisoft/yii2` referenced as [CVE-2018-7269](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-7269).
  Methods allow [SQL injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection) if input is not prepared properly. Attackers could probably execute arbitrary SQL queries
  or circumvent access checking methods applied on query level.
* `yii\redis\ActiveRecord::findOne()` and `yii\redis\ActiveRecord::findAll()` in `yiisoft/yii2-redis` referenced as [CVE-2018-8073](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-8073).
  Methods allow [remote code execution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_code_execution) in redis servers lua script environment. Attackers could probably manipulate
  data on the redis server.
* `yii\elasticsearch\ActiveRecord::findOne()` and `yii\elasticsearch\ActiveRecord::findAll()` in `yiisoft/yii2-elasticsearch` referenced as [CVE-2018-8074](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-8074).
  Methods may allow injecting different search condition than desired or cause an error response from the elasticsearch server.

### Is my Application Affected? [¶](#is-my-application-affected)

This vulnerability affects all releases of the 2.0.x branch. It is fixed in Yii 2.0.15. For versions below 2.0.15, we have released two patch versions, 2.0.13.2 and 2.0.12.1, which apply the fix to 2.0.13.1 and 2.0.12 respectively. Users of 2.0.14, can upgrade to 2.0.15, there are no other changes made in this release.

#### Not Affected Code [¶](#not-affected-code)

The methods `findOne()` and `findAll()` accept a single argument, which can be scalar or array. If the calling code ensures that a scalar is passed
or if client inputs cannot modify the array's structure, your application is **not** affected by this issue.
The following code examples are **not** affected by this issue (examples shown for `findOne()` are valid also for `findAll()`):

```
// yii\web\Controller ensures that $id is scalar
public function actionView($id)
{
    $model = Post::findOne($id);
    // ...
}

```
```
// casting to (int) or (string) ensures no array can be injected (an exception will be thrown so this is not a good practise)
$model = Post::findOne((int) Yii::$app->request->get('id'));

```
```
// explicitly specifying the colum to search, passing a scalar or array here will always result in finding a single record
$model = Post::findOne(['id' => Yii::$app->request->get('id')]);

```
#### Affected Code [¶](#affected-code)

The following code however **is vulnerable**, an attacker could inject an array with an arbitrary condition and even exploit SQL injection:

```
$model = Post::findOne(Yii::$app->request->get('id'));

```

For the above example, the SQL injection part is fixed with the patches provided in this release, but an attacker may still be able to search
records by different condition than a primary key search and violate your application business logic. So passing user input directly like this can cause problems and should be avoided.

### How do I Upgrade? [¶](#how-do-i-upgrade)

If you are using Yii 2.0.14:

```
composer require "yiisoft/yii2":"~2.0.15.0"

```

If you are using Yii 2.0.13:

```
composer require "yiisoft/yii2":"~2.0.13.2"

```

If you are using Yii 2.0.12:

```
composer require "yiisoft/yii2":"~2.0.12.1"

```

If you are using `yii2-redis` extension:

```
composer require "yiisoft/yii2-redis":"~2.0.8"

```

If you are using `yii2-elasticsearch` extension:

```
composer require "yiisoft/yii2-elasticsearch":"~2.0.5"

```

**Update:** We have since released further patches to lower the impact of the BC break introduced by the security fix, so you get versions 2.0.15.1, 2.0.13.3 and 2.0.12.2 from the above.

### Upgrading isn't Enough! [¶](#upgrading-isnt-enough)

Upgrading Yii addresses the SQL injection but doesn't make `findOne()` and `findAll()` safe in general. Check all usages of `findOne()` and `findAll()` in your application. Also note, that `where()` and `filterWhere()` never escape column names, so if you need to pass a variable as a column name, make sure it is safe.

Computer hacking technique[![Classification of SQL injection attack vectors in 2010](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/KD_SQLIA_Classification_2010.png/220px-KD_SQLIA_Classification_2010.png)](/wiki/File%3AKD_SQLIA_Classification_2010.png)

A classification of SQL injection attacking vector as of 2010

In computing, **SQL injection** is a [code injection](/wiki/Code_injection "Code injection") technique used to [attack](/wiki/Attack_%28computing%29 "Attack (computing)") data-driven applications, in which malicious [SQL](/wiki/SQL "SQL") statements are inserted into an entry field for execution (e.g. to dump the [database](/wiki/Database "Database") contents to the attacker).[[1]](#cite_note-1)[[2]](#cite_note-sfw2.12018-2) SQL injection must exploit a [security vulnerability](/wiki/Security_vulnerability "Security vulnerability") in an application's software, for example, when user input is either incorrectly filtered for [string literal](/wiki/String_literal "String literal") [escape characters](/wiki/Escape_sequence "Escape sequence") embedded in SQL statements or user input is not [strongly typed](/wiki/Strongly-typed_programming_language "Strongly-typed programming language") and unexpectedly executed. SQL injection is mostly known as an [attack vector](/wiki/Attack_vector "Attack vector") for websites but can be used to attack any type of SQL database.

SQL injection attacks allow attackers to [spoof](/wiki/Spoofing_attack "Spoofing attack") identity, tamper with existing [data](/wiki/Data "Data"), cause repudiation issues such as voiding transactions or changing balances, allow the complete disclosure of all data on the system, destroy the data or make it otherwise unavailable, and become administrators of the database server. Document-oriented [NoSQL](/wiki/NoSQL "NoSQL") databases can also be affected by this security vulnerability.[[3]](#cite_note-3)

In a 2012 study, it was observed that the average [web application](/wiki/Web_application "Web application") received four attack campaigns per month, and retailers received twice as many attacks as other industries.[[4]](#cite_note-4)

## History

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SQL_injection&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")]

Discussions of SQL injection, such as a 1998 article in [Phrack Magazine](/wiki/Phrack_Magazine "Phrack Magazine"), began in the late 1990s.[[5]](#cite_note-5) SQL injection was considered one of the top 10 web application vulnerabilities of 2007 and 2010 by the [Open Web Application Security Project](/wiki/OWASP "OWASP").[[6]](#cite_note-6) In 2013, SQL injection was rated the number one attack on the OWASP top ten.[[7]](#cite_note-7)

SQL Injection is a common security vulnerability that arises from letting attacker supplied data become SQL code. This happens when programmers assemble SQL queries either by string interpolation or by concatenating SQL commands with user supplied data. Therefore, injection relies on the fact that SQL statements consist of both data used by the SQL statement and commands that control how the SQL statement is executed. For example, in the SQL statement `select * from person where name = 'susan' and age = 2` the string '`susan`' is data and the fragment `and age = 2` is an example of a command (the value `2` is also data in this example).

SQL injection occurs when specially crafted user input is processed by the receiving program in a way that allows the input to exit a data context and enter a command context. This allows the attacker to alter the structure of the SQL statement which is executed.

As a simple example, imagine that the data '`susan`' in the above statement was provided by user input. The user entered the string '`susan`' (without the apostrophes) in a web form text entry field, and the program used [string concatenation](/wiki/String_concatenation "String concatenation") statements to form the above SQL statement from the three fragments `select * from person where name='`, the user input of '`susan`', and `' and age = 2`.

Now imagine that instead of entering '`susan`' the attacker entered `' or 1=1; --`.

The program will use the same string concatenation approach with the 3 fragments of `select * from person where name='`, the user input of `' or 1=1; --`, and `' and age = 2` and construct the statement `select * from person where name='' or 1=1; --' and age = 2`. Many databases will ignore the text after the '--' string as this denotes a comment. The structure of the SQL command is now `select * from person where name='' or 1=1;` and this will select all person rows rather than just those named 'susan' whose age is 2. The attacker has managed to craft a data string which exits the data context and entered a command context.

## Ways to exploit

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SQL_injection&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Ways to exploit")]

Although the root cause of all SQL injections is the same, there are different techniques to exploit it. Some of them are discussed below:

### Getting direct output or action

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SQL_injection&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Getting direct output or action")]

Imagine a program creates a SQL statement using the following string assignment command :

`var statement = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '" + userName + "'";`

This SQL code is designed to pull up the records of the specified username from its table of users. However, if the "userName" variable is crafted in a specific way by a malicious user, the SQL statement may do more than the code author intended. For example, setting the "userName" variable as:

```
' OR '1'='1
```

or using comments to even block the rest of the query (there are three types of SQL comments[[8]](#cite_note-8)). All three lines have a space at the end:

```
' OR '1'='1' --
' OR '1'='1' {
' OR '1'='1' /*
```

renders one of the following SQL statements by the parent language:

```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '' OR '1'='1';

```

```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '' OR '1'='1' -- ';

```

If this code were to be used in authentication procedure then this example could be used to force the selection of every data field (\*) from *all* users rather than from one specific user name as the coder intended, because the evaluation of '1'='1' is always true.

The following value of "userName" in the statement below would cause the deletion of the "users" table as well as the selection of all data from the "userinfo" table (in essence revealing the information of every user), using an [API](/wiki/API "API") that allows multiple statements:

`a';``DROP TABLE users; SELECT * FROM userinfo WHERE 't' = 't`

This input renders the final SQL statement as follows and specified:

```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'a';DROP TABLE users; SELECT * FROM userinfo WHERE 't' = 't';

```

While most SQL server implementations allow multiple statements to be executed with one call in this way, some SQL APIs such as [PHP](/wiki/PHP "PHP")'s `mysql_query()` function do not allow this for security reasons. This prevents attackers from injecting entirely separate queries, but doesn't stop them from modifying queries.

### Blind SQL injection

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SQL_injection&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Blind SQL injection")]

Blind SQL injection is used when a web application is vulnerable to a SQL injection, but the results of the injection are not visible to the attacker. The page with the vulnerability may not be one that displays data but will display differently depending on the results of a logical statement injected into the legitimate SQL statement called for that page.
This type of attack has traditionally been considered time-intensive because a new statement needed to be crafted for each bit recovered, and depending on its structure, the attack may consist of many unsuccessful requests. Recent advancements have allowed each request to recover multiple bits, with no unsuccessful requests, allowing for more consistent and efficient extraction.[[9]](#cite_note-9) There are several tools that can automate these attacks once the location of the vulnerability and the target information has been established.[[10]](#cite_note-10)

#### Conditional responses

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SQL_injection&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Conditional responses")]

One type of blind SQL injection forces the database to evaluate a logical statement on an ordinary application screen. As an example, a book review website uses a [query string](/wiki/Query_string "Query string") to determine which book review to display. So the [URL](/wiki/URL "URL") `https://books.example.com/review?id=5` would cause the server to run the query

```
SELECT * FROM bookreviews WHERE ID = '5';

```

from which it would populate the review page with data from the review with [ID](/wiki/Identifier "Identifier") 5, stored in the [table](/wiki/Table_%28database%29 "Table (database)") bookreviews. The query happens completely on the server; the user does not know the names of the database, table, or fields, nor does the user know the query string. The user only sees that the above URL returns a book review. A [hacker](/wiki/Security_hacker "Security hacker") can load the URLs `https://books.example.com/review?id=5' OR '1'='1` and `https://books.example.com/review?id=5' AND '1'='2`, which may result in queries

```
SELECT * FROM bookreviews WHERE ID = '5' OR '1'='1';
SELECT * FROM bookreviews WHERE ID = '5' AND '1'='2';

```

respectively. If the original review loads with the "1=1" URL and a blank or error page is returned from the "1=2" URL, and the returned page has not been created to alert the user the input is invalid, or in other words, has been caught by an input test script, the site is likely vulnerable to an SQL injection attack as the query will likely have passed through successfully in both cases. The hacker may proceed with this query string designed to reveal the version number of [MySQL](/wiki/MySQL "MySQL") running on the server: `https://books.example.com/review?id=5 AND substring(@@version, 1, INSTR(@@version, '.') - 1)=4`, which would show the book review on a server running MySQL 4 and a blank or error page otherwise. The hacker can continue to use code within query strings to achieve their goal directly, or to glean more information from the server in hopes of discovering another avenue of attack.[[11]](#cite_note-11)[[12]](#cite_note-12)

### Second-order SQL injection

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SQL_injection&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Second-order SQL injection")]

Second-order SQL injection occurs when an application only guards its SQL against immediate user input, but has a less strict policy when dealing with data already stored in the system. Therefore, although such application would manage to safely process the user input and store it without issue, it would store the malicious SQL statement as well. Then, when another part of that application would use that data in a query that isn't protected from SQL injection, this malicious statement might get executed.[[13]](#cite_note-13)
This attack requires more knowledge of how submitted values are later used. Automated web application security scanners would not easily detect this type of SQL injection and may need to be manually instructed where to check for evidence that it is being attempted.

In order to protect from this kind of attack, all SQL processing must be uniformly secure, despite the data source.

## Prevention/Mitigation

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SQL_injection&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Prevention/Mitigation")]

An SQL injection is a well known attack and easily prevented by simple measures. After an apparent SQL injection [attack on TalkTalk](/wiki/2015_TalkTalk_data_breach "2015 TalkTalk data breach") in 2015, the [BBC](/wiki/BBC "BBC") reported that security experts were stunned that such a large company would be vulnerable to it.[[14]](#cite_note-14) Techniques like pattern matching, software testing, and grammar analysis are some common ways to mitigate these attacks.[[2]](#cite_note-sfw2.12018-2)

Prevention measures listed further below can be summarized into a simple two-part checklist:

1. Every variable [data literal](/wiki/Literal_%28computer_programming%29 "Literal (computer programming)") should be represented in the query by a special marker, and later bound to the query through a [prepared statement](/wiki/Prepared_statement "Prepared statement")
2. Every other query part (such as [keyword](/wiki/Reserved_word "Reserved word") or [database schema](/wiki/Database_schema "Database schema") name) must be filtered through a [whitelist](/wiki/Whitelist "Whitelist")

A simple example in PHP demonstrating usage of both rules:

```
$mysqli = new mysqli('hostname', 'db_username', 'db_password', 'db_name');
$sort_column = $_GET['sort_column'] ?? 'name';
// checking the column name against a whitelist:
if (!in_array($sort_column, ['name', 'birthday'], true)) {
    throw new InvalidArgumentException("Invalid sort column");
}
// using a parameter to represent the data value:
$query = "SELECT * FROM `users` WHERE `birthday` > ? ORDER BY `$sort_column`",
// preparing SQL, binding the birthday value and executing the query:
$result = $mysqli->execute_query($query, [$_GET['birthday']]);

```

This way, no malicious data will be able to make it into SQL.

### String escaping

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SQL_injection&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: String escaping")]

One of the traditional ways to prevent injections is to add *every piece of data as a quoted string* and [escape](/wiki/Escape_sequence "Escape sequence") all characters, that have special meaning in SQL strings, in that data.[[15]](#cite_note-15) The manual for an SQL DBMS explains which characters have a special meaning, which allows creating a comprehensive [blacklist](/wiki/Blacklist_%28computing%29 "Blacklist (computing)") of characters that need translation. For instance, every occurrence of a single quote (`'`) in a string parameter must be prepended with a backslash (`\`) so that the database understands the single quote is part of a given string, rather than its terminator. [PHP](/wiki/PHP "PHP")'s [MySQLi](/wiki/MySQLi "MySQLi") module provides the `mysqli_real_escape_string()` function to escape strings according to [MySQL](/wiki/MySQL "MySQL") semantics; in the following example the username is a string parameter, and therefore it can be protected by means of string escaping:

```
$mysqli = new mysqli('hostname', 'db_username', 'db_password', 'db_name');
$query = sprintf("SELECT * FROM `Users` WHERE UserName='%s'",
                  $mysqli->real_escape_string($username),
$mysqli->query($query);

```

Depending solely on the programmer to diligently escape all string parameters presents inherent risks, given the potential for oversights in the process. To mitigate this vulnerability, programmers may opt to develop their own [abstraction](/wiki/Abstraction_%28computer_science%29 "Abstraction (computer science)") layers to automate the escaping of parameters.[[16]](#cite_note-16)

Besides, not every piece of data can be added to SQL as a string literal (MySQL's LIMIT clause arguments[[17]](#cite_note-17) or table/column names[[18]](#cite_note-18) for example) and in this case escaping string-related special characters will do no good whatsoever, **leaving resulting SQL open to injections**.

### Object relational mappers

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SQL_injection&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Object relational mappers")]

[Object–relational mapping](/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping "Object–relational mapping") (ORM) frameworks such as [Hibernate](/wiki/Hibernate_%28framework%29 "Hibernate (framework)") and [ActiveRecord](/wiki/ActiveRecord "ActiveRecord") provide an object-oriented interface for queries over a relational database. Most, if not all, ORMs, automatically handle the escaping needed to prevent SQL injection attacks, as a part of the framework's query API. However, many ORMs provide the ability to bypass their mapping facilities and emit raw SQL statements; improper use of this functionality can introduce the possibility for an injection attack.[[19]](#cite_note-19)

### Parameterized statements

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SQL_injection&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Parameterized statements")]
Main article: [Prepared statement](/wiki/Prepared_statement "Prepared statement")

With most development platforms, parameterized statements that work with parameters can be used (sometimes called placeholders or [bind variables](/wiki/Bind_variable "Bind variable")) instead of embedding user input in the statement. A placeholder can only store a value of the given type and not an arbitrary SQL fragment. Hence the SQL injection would simply be treated as a strange (and probably invalid) parameter value. In many cases, the SQL statement is fixed, and each parameter is a [scalar](/wiki/Scalar_%28computing%29 "Scalar (computing)"), not a [table](/wiki/Table_%28database%29 "Table (database)"). The user input is then assigned (bound) to a parameter.[[20]](#cite_note-20)

### Pattern check

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SQL_injection&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Pattern check")]

Integer, float, or Boolean string parameters can be checked to determine if their value is a valid representation of the given type. Strings that must adhere to a specific pattern or condition (e.g. dates, [UUIDs](/wiki/UUIDs "UUIDs"), phone numbers) can also be checked to determine if said pattern is matched.

### Database permissions

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SQL_injection&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Database permissions")]

Limiting the permissions on the database login used by the web application to only what is needed may help reduce the effectiveness of any SQL injection attacks that exploit any bugs in the web application.

For example, on [Microsoft SQL Server](/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server "Microsoft SQL Server"), a database logon could be restricted from selecting on some of the system tables which would limit exploits that try to insert JavaScript into all the text columns in the database.

```
deny select on sys.sysobjects to webdatabaselogon;
deny select on sys.objects to webdatabaselogon;
deny select on sys.tables to webdatabaselogon;
deny select on sys.views to webdatabaselogon;
deny select on sys.packages to webdatabaselogon;

```
