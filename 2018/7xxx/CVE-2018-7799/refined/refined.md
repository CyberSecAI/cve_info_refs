**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Schneider Electric Software Update (SESU) product uses an uncontrolled search path to find resources, specifically DLL files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427):** The software does not validate the location from which it loads DLL files. This allows an attacker to introduce a malicious DLL in a location where the application searches.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** An attacker with local access to the target system can place a specially crafted DLL file in a location where the vulnerable application searches for DLLs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs local access to the target system.
*   The attacker needs the ability to write files to a directory where SESU searches for DLLs.
