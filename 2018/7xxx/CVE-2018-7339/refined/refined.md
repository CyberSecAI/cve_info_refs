The provided content is related to CVE-2018-7339.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of the Entry Number within the MP4 Table Property when parsing a crafted MP4 file. Specifically, the `MP4Atom` class in `mp4atom.cpp` mishandles this validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient input validation: The code fails to properly check the Entry Number during the parsing of MP4 files.
- Memory corruption: Due to the improper validation, a small memory chunk may be allocated, leading to an out-of-bounds memory access during subsequent operations which triggers a crash.
- Specifically, the vulnerability exists in the `m_pProperties[i]` access during the `MP4Atom` destructor.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A maliciously crafted MP4 file can crash the application (segmentation fault), rendering it unavailable.
- Potential unspecified impact: The description mentions a possibility of "unspecified other impact" beyond denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote attackers can trigger this vulnerability by providing a crafted MP4 file for parsing by the vulnerable `mp4v2` library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to supply a crafted MP4 file that triggers the invalid Entry Number condition. No special privileges are needed on the target system itself.
- The target system needs to be running software utilizing the vulnerable `mp4v2` library.
