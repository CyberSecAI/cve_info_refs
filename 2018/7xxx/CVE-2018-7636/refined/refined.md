Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7636:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the PAN-OS URL filtering "continue page" not properly validating specific request parameters. This lack of validation allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79) due to improper neutralization of input during web page generation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML into specially crafted URLs. This could lead to:
    - Modification of the content displayed on the "continue page."
    - Execution of malicious scripts in the user's browser when they access the crafted link.
    - Potential for session hijacking or other attacks depending on the injected script.
- The vulnerability has a confidentiality and integrity impact of "LOW." There is no impact on availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- Attackers can inject malicious code through specially crafted URLs.
- Requires user interaction by clicking on the crafted URL, making this a reflected XSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any privileges or authentication to exploit this vulnerability, making the attack vector readily accessible.
- Requires the ability to craft malicious URLs and trick the victim into accessing them.
- The attack is network-based, implying that the attacker can be remotely located.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects PAN-OS version 8.0.10 and earlier, but it is not present in 8.1.x, 7.1.x, and 6.1.x.
- The "continue page" and "admin override page" are affected, while the "block page" is not impacted.
- The vulnerability has a medium severity score (6.1) according to CVSS v3.1.
- A patch was released in PAN-OS 8.0.11-h1 to address the issue.
