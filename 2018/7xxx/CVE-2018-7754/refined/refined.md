Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `aoedisk_debugfs_show` function in `drivers/block/aoe/aoeblk.c` exposes the address of the next element in a list (`(*t)->ffree.next`) when the list is not empty through debugfs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** The debugfs interface provides a way to access kernel memory addresses, which can be used by a local attacker to gain information about memory layout and potentially bypass security measures.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Leak:** A local attacker can read sensitive kernel memory addresses. This information could be used to aid in further exploitation or bypass security mechanisms.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Load the `aoe` module:** An attacker needs to load the `aoe` kernel module using `modprobe aoe`.
2.  **Set up the AOE disk network:** An attacker needs to establish an AOE disk network configuration.
3.  **Access Debugfs:** An attacker needs to read the debugfs file related to the affected device, typically found at `/sys/kernel/debug/aoe/etherd/e*`, where '*' represents the device number.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system to perform the above steps.
*   **Privileges:** The attacker needs to have privileges to load kernel modules and access the debugfs filesystem.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in Linux kernel versions up to and including 4.16.rc4 and was introduced in version >=3.12.rc1
*   The vulnerability is present in the `aoeblk.c` file in the Linux kernel source.
*   The vulnerability allows reading kernel addresses via a debugfs entry, which is typically only available to privileged users.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by ADLab of VenusTech
