  "cve_id": "CVE-2018-7583",
  "description": "The DualDesk application's Proxy.exe server component, listening on TCP port 5500, is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. Remote, unauthenticated attackers can crash the application by sending a long string of junk characters.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A stack buffer overflow in the Proxy.exe server component due to insufficient input validation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack buffer overflow",
      "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (DoS). The Proxy.exe service crashes and becomes unavailable.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network based attack",
        "Sending a long string of junk data to the vulnerable service"
    ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker can be remote and unauthenticated. The attacker needs the ability to send arbitrary data to TCP port 5500 of the target system."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The provided exploit is a proof of concept that uses netcat (nc.exe) to send a large string of 'a' characters to the vulnerable port which crashes the service"
