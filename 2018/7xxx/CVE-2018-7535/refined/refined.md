Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-7535

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause of the vulnerability is insecure file system permissions set on the installation directory of Total AV. Specifically, the "C:\Program Files\TotalAV" folder grants full access to all users on the system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Permissions:** The primary vulnerability lies in the overly permissive access control list (ACL) set on the TotalAV installation directory. This allows any user on the system to have full control (modify, delete, execute) of files within the directory.
- **Privilege Escalation:** This weak permission structure can be exploited to escalate privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can replace legitimate executable files within the TotalAV installation directory with malicious ones.
- **Privilege Escalation:** When TotalAV executes these replaced files, the malicious code runs with the privileges of the user or service running TotalAV, potentially gaining SYSTEM level access.
- **Persistence:** An attacker can use this to achieve persistence by replacing a file that's executed on system startup or at regular intervals.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have an existing user account on the target system to leverage the vulnerability.
- **File Replacement:** The attack requires replacing legitimate files within the TotalAV installation directory with malicious ones.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Account:** The attacker must have a local user account on the target system to modify the files in the installation directory.
- **Basic File System Knowledge:** They need to know how to replace files in a directory.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Total AV versions 4.1.7 through 4.6.19.
- The vendor was initially contacted about the vulnerability on 06/28/2018, and again on 07/12/2018 but did not respond.
- The advisory was published on 07/12/2018.
