The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Tiki wiki CMS Groupware 17.1. Here's a breakdown of each:

**1. XSS through SVG File Upload**

*   **Root cause:** The CMS allows uploading a `.png` file containing SVG content without properly validating the file's actual content.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Lack of proper file content validation during upload, specifically for SVG content disguised as a PNG file.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser when the malicious image is viewed, potentially leading to session hijacking, information theft, or defacement.
*   **Attack vectors:** Uploading a specially crafted `.png` file containing SVG code.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Authenticated user access to upload files within the CMS.

**2. CSV Injection**

*   **Root cause:** The CMS does not sanitize or validate user input for special characters.
*  **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**  Lack of input sanitization for special characters, particularly within fields that might be exported as CSV files.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can inject malicious commands into CSV files. When opened with a spreadsheet program, the program can execute these commands, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.
*   **Attack vectors:** Inputting a formula payload (e.g., `=cmd|' /C calc'!A0`)  into fields within the CMS that are exported as CSV files.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Authenticated user access to input data into the CMS.

**3. HTML Injection**

*   **Root cause:** The CMS does not properly handle user-supplied data, allowing the injection of HTML tags.
*  **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Lack of input sanitization and output encoding of HTML content entered by the user.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML into the page and manipulate the content, leading to phishing attacks, defacement, or redirection of users to malicious websites.
*   **Attack vectors:**  Inputting HTML code (e.g., `<h1>hacked</h1>`) into input fields within the CMS (specifically in the Calendar feature).
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Authenticated user access to input data into the CMS.
