I found one already: it filters out `command` but not $(command).

I'm afraid this library appears to have been written without any regard
for security, or even the existence of multiuser systems.

Bug #890548 (stack buffer overflows) is probably exploitable in wheezy,
and I think there are more instances.

Bug #885704 (hardcoded paths in /tmp) has been closed in unstable but I
can still see:
