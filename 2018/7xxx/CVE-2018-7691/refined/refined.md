Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability in the REST API of Fortify Software Security Center (SSC).
*   The application fails to properly check ownership of "authEntities" allowing unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The API does not properly validate user permissions when accessing resources via their direct IDs.
*   **Insufficient Authorization Checks:** The application does not verify if the user has the right to access specific user details or project information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can access arbitrary details of local and LDAP users, including potentially sensitive information like usernames, and other account details, as well as details about other user's projects.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **REST API:** The vulnerability is exposed through the SSC's REST API, specifically the `/api/v1/bulk` endpoint with a crafted JSON payload.
*   **HTTP POST Method:** The attack is performed using POST requests.
*   **`/api/v1/projectVersions/{NUMBER}/authEntities`:** This specific API endpoint is vulnerable to IDOR.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account, even one with view-only permissions, on the vulnerable Fortify SSC instance.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting Fortify SSC.
*   **Understanding of the API Structure:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable API endpoint and how to craft the malicious request.

**Technical Details:**

*   The attacker sends a POST request to `/ssc/api/v1/bulk` with a JSON payload that contains a request to the vulnerable `/api/v1/projectVersions/{NUMBER}/authEntities` endpoint using a `GET` method. By manipulating the `NUMBER` parameter, different user/project details can be accessed without proper authorization checks.
*   The attacker can use tools like `curl` and `jq` to send the crafted request and parse the JSON response.

**Versions Affected:**

*   Fortify Software Security Center (SSC) versions 17.10, 17.20, and 18.10.

**Mitigation:**

*   Install the latest patches provided by Micro Focus.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited by an authenticated user with view-only role, which is a restricted role.
*   The exploit can be automated using Burp Suite to iterate over different project/user IDs.
