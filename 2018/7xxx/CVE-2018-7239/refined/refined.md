- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to an uncontrolled search path element. The software loads DLLs based on the system's search path, and a malicious DLL placed in a directory in that path could be executed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL in a directory that is part of the search path of the affected software.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access to the system where the affected software is installed. A low level of skill is needed for exploitation.
