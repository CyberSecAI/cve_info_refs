Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7688:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the Open Build Service (OBS) API not properly validating the state of reviews during request creation. Specifically, an unprivileged user could create a request with reviews already in an "accepted" state, bypassing the intended review process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The OBS API failed to check if the user creating the request had the necessary permissions to set the state of reviews.
- **Bypassed Review Process:** The ability to create requests with pre-accepted reviews allowed malicious users to circumvent the intended review and approval workflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Package Modification:** By creating a request with pre-accepted reviews, an attacker could potentially modify or replace packages in a project without proper authorization.
- **Privilege Escalation:**  An attacker could gain elevated privileges by adding themselves as a maintainer or through similar means.
- **System Compromise:** Depending on the nature of the packages modified and their role, a successful attack could compromise the affected system's integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious user crafts a specifically crafted XML request file.
- This crafted XML request file contains review states that are set to "accepted."
- The attacker sends the crafted request to the OBS API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker must have an account on the OBS instance.
- The attacker must be able to create requests within the OBS system.
- No special privileges are required beyond the ability to create requests.
