| [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1094820#c1)  Adrian Schröter   2018-05-28 07:26:33 UTC  ``` Description by Marcus:  Currently, an unprivileged user can create a new request where all reviews are in the state "accepted" instead of "new". From the OBS' point of view, this is just a bug, but combined with a specific workflow this can be exploited, for instance, to modify a package. For this, consider the following scenario:  For each request, the project "testprj" requires two reviews from the users "Admin" and "Bob". Moreover, every hour a script is automatically executed that works as follows: - retrieve all open requests for the project "testprj" - for each such request: accept the request if all of its reviews are   in the state "accepted"  IMHO, this is legitimate workflow (or at least not an artificial one).  Next, assume the user "mallory" wants to modify the "testprj/foo" package. For this, she prepares a "home:mallory/crafted_foo" package and creates the following submit request:  marcus@linux:~> cat request.xml  <request>   <action type="submit">     <source project="home:mallory" package="crafted_foo"/>     <target project="testprj" package="foo"/>   </action>   <review state="accepted" by_user="Admin"/>   <review state="accepted" by_user="Bob"/> </request> marcus@linux:~> curl -u mallory:foobar -X POST -T request.xml <http://0.0.0.0:3000/request?cmd=create> <request id="11" creator="mallory">   <action type="submit">     <source project="home:mallory" package="crafted_foo"/>     <target project="testprj" package="foo"/>   </action>   <state name="new" who="mallory" when="2018-05-27T10:25:17">     <comment/>   </state>   <review state="accepted" when="2018-05-27T10:25:17" by_user="Admin"/>   <review state="accepted" when="2018-05-27T10:25:17" by_user="Bob"/> </request> marcus@linux:~>  Unless no one else notices and declines this request, it will be accepted by the script after at most 1 hour. Hence, mallory is (potentially) able to modify the "testprj/foo" package.   The problem is that the current request creation code does not check if the user that creates the request has the permission to change the state of each review. The 0001-frontend-Sanitize-the-review-state-during-request-cr.patch patch fixes this in a more conservative way by setting the state of each review to "new" (for the drawback of this approach, see the commit description).   Implications Depending on the concrete workflow, an unprivileged user can create a request that is eventually accepted. Among others, this can be used to create, modify, delete a package, to make a user a maintainer of a specific project/package etc. According to [1], such a workflow is not used by the openSUSE:Factory maintainers.

OBS 2.9.3 released
==================
We're happy to announce the release of Open Build Service Version 2.9.3.
This release includes 2 security fixes and we recommend to update your
OBS instance as soon as possible.
Please check out the release notes for further details or contact us.
In addition this release includes a couple of bugfixes for the OBS
frontend and backend.
Install 2.9
=========
Please read our setup instructions
[https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/blob/2.9/README.md#installati...](https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/blob/2.9/README.md#installation)
or even better, use our appliance
[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/OBS:/Server:/2.9/images/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/OBS%3A/Server%3A/2.9/images/)
Update to OBS 2.9
===============
In case you update from a previous OBS stable release please read
the README.UPDATERS file which comes with this version.
<https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/blob/2.9/dist/README.UPDATERS>
OBS Appliance users who have set up their LVM
<http://openbuildservice.org/download/#appliance_config>
can just replace their appliance image without data loss. The migration
will happen automatically.
Details from Release Notes
===================
Features
=======
Backend:
\* Allow to use different scheduling strategy which handles large
build dependency cycles
better. Enable it via project config:
BuildFlags: genmetaalgo:1
Bugfixes
========
Frontend:
\* Fixes permission issue that allowd unpermitted users to trigger
services via the webui.
\* Permits setting the initial bs request state. This prevents setting
the initial state
to something else than 'new' (CVE-2018-7689).
\* Fixes permission check for projects with 'InitializeDevelPackage'
attribute (CVE-2018-7688).
\* Fixes rendering of requests with multiple submit requests.
Previously switching tabs would
not trigger a reload of the request content for the selected request.
Backend:
\* Debian fixes to 2.9 - publish ONIE binary and hashsum, enable
Secure Boot EFI signing for Debian packages.
\* New regex needssslcertforbuild for Debian builds
\* Support publishing via rsync syntax (allows to specify port numbers)
\* Make project config parser errors always visible
\* Fix corner case on wiping binaries
\* Improved .changes merge handling
\* Don't publish unneeded files of appdata in meta data
\* Fixing lost events on restarting schedulers
\* Make errors by not reachable remote instances better visible.
