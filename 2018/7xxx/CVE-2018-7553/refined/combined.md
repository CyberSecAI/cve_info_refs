Package        : sam2p
Version        : 0.49.1-1+deb7u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-7487 CVE-2018-7551 CVE-2018-7552
                 CVE-2018-7553 CVE-2018-7554

Multiple invalid frees and buffer-overflow vulnerabilities were
discovered in sam2p, a utility to convert raster images and
other image formats, that may lead to a denial-of-service (application
crash) or unspecified other impact.

For Debian 7 "Wheezy", these problems have been fixed in version
0.49.1-1+deb7u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your sam2p packages.
