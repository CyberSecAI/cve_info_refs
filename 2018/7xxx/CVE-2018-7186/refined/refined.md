{
  "CVE-2018-7186": {
    "Description": "Leptonica before 1.75.3 does not limit the number of characters in a %s format argument to fscanf or sscanf, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a long string, as demonstrated by the gplotRead and ptaReadStream functions.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to the usage of fscanf and sscanf without limiting the number of characters read into a buffer when using the %s format specifier.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote attackers can cause a denial of service by overflowing a stack buffer. There is also the possibility of other unspecified impacts.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending a long string to a vulnerable function that uses fscanf or sscanf with the %s format specifier.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send a long string as input to the vulnerable functions.",
    "Affected functions": [
        "gplotRead",
        "ptaReadStream"
    ],
        "Additional details": [
        "The vulnerability was present in gplotRead() and ptaReadStream() due to unbounded string reads using fscanf().",
        "The fix involves using length-limited specifiers like %511s in fscanf() to prevent buffer overflows.",
        "Similar issues were found and fixed in other functions using sscanf().",
          "The issue was addressed upstream with commit ee301cb2029db8a6289c5295daa42bba7715e99a, which limits the length of the string read by fscanf and sscanf."
