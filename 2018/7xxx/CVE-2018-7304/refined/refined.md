The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Tiki wiki CMS version 17.1, but only one of them is relevant to CVE-2018-7304. Based on the information, the following vulnerability is related to the CVE:

**Vulnerability Title:** XSS through SVG File Upload

*   **Root Cause:** The CMS allows the upload of files with a `.png` extension that actually contain SVG content without proper validation, leading to potential XSS.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Improper file type validation. The CMS checks the file extension but not the actual file content, allowing SVG content disguised as a PNG to be uploaded.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attacker uploads a file with a .png extension containing malicious SVG code. The malicious script is then executed when the uploaded file is rendered in the browser, resulting in an XSS attack.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user who has permission to upload files to the CMS.
