#### [100% The Best, Most Comprehensive Property Listing Extension Out There!](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/vertical-markets/real-estate/os-property/#rev-122132)

[Melanie (4).](/profile/profile/details/542760)

Posted on 11 August 2022

###### Functionality

Created a property website very quickly. So many features/functionality packed in to this component. Property listings, incredible search

###### Ease of use

Very easy to use. Very well thought out and structured. Had my property website fully up and running in a very short time. Very impressed!

###### Support

100% excellent support service. Fast to respond and help. Very friendly and even when its our mistake they still help to put things right.

###### Documentation

Excellent comprehensive documentation. It covered everything I needed to both get me started and also trouble shoot when things went wrong

###### Value for money

Excellent value! The component is worth far more than the company currently charge. It should be at least double what they sell it for now.

I used this to:
A property website where users can browse for property to buy or rent, commercial or residential. It is packed with features and functions no other solution had when doing my research for a component. I don't think they are pricing this at the right level. It is worth way more!

#### [Good extension](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/vertical-markets/real-estate/os-property/#rev-119981)

Posted on 19 July 2021

###### Functionality

The extension is able to offer a wide spectrum of functionalities.

###### Ease of use

Once you get to know the tool, it is intuitive to use. When a debug arises the developer fixes it.

###### Support

The support is good. The developer debugs any issues that come up with you website. Very good support.

###### Documentation

I did not have the need to read it a lot. I notices some screenshot are done in Joomla 2.5 but I guess the interface did not change.

###### Value for money

The extension is not expensive. You get a great tool for little money.

I used this to:
Websites that sell properties. For two clients. They are satisfait.

#### [Out of this world support](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/vertical-markets/real-estate/os-property/#rev-119277)

###### Functionality

Very complete functionality and extensibility using custom fields.

###### Ease of use

Very easy to use and integrate into templates. Throught eh support of Dam, we were even able to write our own custom import for OpenImmo.

###### Support

This is my real reason for the review. dam provides support that is up there with the best of the business. Fast, accurate and courteous!

###### Documentation

Documentation may need some work here and there, but that is completely offset by Dam's support.

###### Value for money

Super value for money. Rivals easily with more expensive options on this and other platforms. We actually migrated from a $500+ component.

I used this to:
Customized Joomla site for a client with our own OpenImmo import functionality.

###### Functionality

I worked with several real estate extensions, but I stayed at OS Property for almost 10 years. Os Property is truly the best in the world!

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
