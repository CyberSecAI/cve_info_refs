**Vulnerability Title :** XSS through SVG File Upload

**Authentication**: Required

**Description:**

CMS allows upload of .PNG file which is actually having SVG content without checking.

**Step 1:** Create the .txt file using below SVG content

<?xml version="1.0" standalone="no"?><!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd"><svg onload="alert(1)" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><defs><font id="x"><font-face font-family="y"/></font></defs></svg>

**Step 2:** Now save this file with .png extension as CMS disallows the .svg file from upload.

Please check out the video for more info.

**Vulnerability Title :**CSV Injection
**Authentication**: Required

**Description:**
The CMS does not validate the user input for special
characters, hence it lead an attacker to open a CMD or Calculator on the victim
machine to perform malicious activity.

I have entered payload **=cmd|' /C calc'!A0 .**

Please check out the video for more info.

**Vulnerability Title :**HTML Injection
**Authentication**: Required

**Description:**
HTML injection is an attack that is similar to Cross-site
Scripting (XSS). While in the XSS vulnerability the attacker can inject and
execute JavaScript code, the HTML injection attack only allows the injection of
certain HTML tags. When an application does not properly handle user supplied
data, an attacker can supply valid HTML code, typically via a parameter value,
and inject their own content into the page. This attack is typically used in
conjunction with some form of social engineering, as the attack is exploiting a
code-based vulnerability and a user's trust.
A possible attack scenario is demonstrated below:

* Attacker discovers injection vulnerability and decides to use an
  HTML injection attack
* Attacker crafts malicious link, including his injected HTML
  content, and sends it to a user via email
* The user visits the page due to the page being located within a
  trusted domain
* The attacker's injected HTML is rendered and presented to the user
  asking for a username and password
* The user enters a username and password, which are both sent to the
  attackers server.

I have entered payload **<h1>hacked</h1>**
into the input field on Calendar and save it.
