The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Tiki wiki CMS version 17.1. Only the XSS vulnerability through SVG file upload relates to CVE-2018-7302.

**Vulnerability Title:** XSS through SVG File Upload

**Root Cause:** The CMS allows the upload of a .PNG file containing SVG content without proper validation. This bypasses the intended restriction of not allowing .svg file uploads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper file type validation: The system does not properly validate the content of the uploaded file, relying solely on the file extension.

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can upload a malicious SVG file disguised as a PNG, which, when rendered by the browser, executes embedded JavaScript code, leading to XSS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- File upload: An attacker uploads a specially crafted file with a .png extension that contains SVG code with embedded JavaScript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user to access the file upload functionality.
