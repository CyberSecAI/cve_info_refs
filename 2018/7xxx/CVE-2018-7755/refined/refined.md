Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7755:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `fd_locked_ioctl` function within the Linux kernel's floppy driver. Specifically, when handling the `FDGETPRM` ioctl, the floppy driver copies a `floppy_struct`, which includes a kernel pointer to a string (`name`) to user memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Leak:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of a kernel pointer to user space. This pointer, intended for internal kernel use, reveals the memory address of kernel code and data.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The driver fails to validate whether the destination address of the copy is in kernel space or user space.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Kernel Address Space Layout Exposure:** The main impact is the ability of a local user to determine the memory location of kernel code and data. This undermines kernel address space layout randomization (KASLR), a security mechanism intended to make exploitation of other vulnerabilities more difficult.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** This information leak could be a stepping stone for further attacks, although the primary impact is information disclosure.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local access:**  A local user with access to a floppy drive device can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local User:** The attacker must be a user with local access to the system and with the ability to interact with a floppy device.

**Additional Details:**

- The fix for this issue involves modifying the `fd_locked_ioctl` function to copy the `floppy_struct` to user memory except for the `name` pointer field by calculating the correct size with `offsetof`.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Brian Belleville.
- Various distributions (Debian, Red Hat, Ubuntu) have released patches to address this vulnerability in their respective kernels.
- The vulnerability affects multiple kernel versions, including those in stable and extended support releases of various Linux distributions.
