Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7187:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `go get` command's handling of import paths when the `-insecure` flag is used. Specifically, the `go get` implementation does not validate the import path, allowing attackers to inject malicious commands within the `go-import` meta tag of a remote website.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Import Path Validation:** The `go get` command, when used with the `-insecure` flag, fails to properly sanitize or validate the content of the `go-import` meta tag found on remote websites. This allows for the injection of arbitrary commands.
*   **Command Injection:** The ability to inject arbitrary commands in the `go-import` tag leads to command injection vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability enables a remote attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands on the victim's machine. This can have severe consequences, such as system compromise, data theft, or denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Website:** An attacker can host a malicious website with a specially crafted `go-import` meta tag.
*   **`go get` Command:** The attacker would then need to entice a victim to use the `go get -insecure <malicious-url>` command. The `-insecure` flag is essential for exploitation.
*   **VCS Hook Exploitation:** The vulnerability specifically exploits how `go get` uses Version Control Systems (VCS) like Mercurial. The malicious website provides a `go-import` meta tag instructing `go get` to use `hg` with a specific `pre-clone` hook that executes the attacker's command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Publicly Accessible Website:** The attacker needs access to a web server to host the malicious `go-import` tag.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick a user into using the `go get -insecure` command with the crafted website's URL.
*   **Understanding of Go Import Mechanism:**  The attacker must understand how `go get` and the `go-import` meta tag work to craft a suitable attack payload.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when using the `-insecure` flag with `go get`, indicating a bypass of security checks and exposing the system to remote command injection.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Go, including version 1.9.4 and earlier.
*   The `go-import` meta tag is used to specify how `go get` should obtain a package from a remote repository.
*   The proof of concept demonstrates the execution of `echo hello $USER` through a Mercurial `pre-clone` hook configured using the `go-import` meta tag.
