Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7420:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the pcapng file parser of Wireshark. Specifically, there is a missing bounds check during memory allocation within the `pcapng.c` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Missing bounds check:** The core issue is a lack of proper validation on the size of memory being allocated by the pcapng parser. This can lead to allocating insufficient memory.
*   **Memory Corruption:** If the allocated memory is insufficient to hold the expected data, it can result in memory corruption when the parser attempts to write beyond allocated memory boundaries.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Crash:** The primary impact of this vulnerability is that it can cause Wireshark to crash due to the memory corruption.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malformed pcapng file:** An attacker can craft a malformed pcapng file that triggers the vulnerability when opened by a user in Wireshark.
*   **Network Injection:** It may also be possible to inject a malformed packet onto the wire that, when captured and processed by Wireshark, can lead to the crash.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a malformed pcapng file or inject specially crafted network packets to a system running a vulnerable version of Wireshark.

**Additional notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Magnus Stubman.
*   The issue is tracked internally as Wireshark issue 14403.
*   The vulnerability affects Wireshark versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.4 and 2.2.0 to 2.2.12.
*   The issue is resolved in Wireshark versions 2.4.5, 2.2.13 and later.
