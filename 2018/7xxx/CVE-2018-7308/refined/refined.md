- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection on sensitive authenticated actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The web application lacks CSRF protection, which allows an attacker to potentially perform actions on behalf of an authenticated user without their knowledge or consent.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could perform sensitive actions on behalf of a user, potentially leading to unauthorized changes, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website that then performs actions on the web application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request that targets the vulnerable web application and trick a logged-in user into executing it. This usually involves the user being logged into the targeted application when the attack is performed.
