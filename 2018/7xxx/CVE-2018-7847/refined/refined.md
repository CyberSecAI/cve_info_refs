Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-7847:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control within the UMAS (Unified Messaging and Automation System) protocol used by Schneider Electric's Modicon M580 Programmable Automation Controller. Specifically, it's an exploitable, unauthenticated file write vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The device does not adequately verify the source of UMAS commands, allowing an attacker to send unauthenticated commands to modify the device's program.
*   **Reliance on Untrusted Inputs:** The device processes UMAS commands without sufficient validation, allowing for the writing of arbitrary data to the strategy file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Strategy Overwrite:** An attacker can overwrite the device's programmed strategy with a malicious one.
*   **Configuration Modification:**  Exploitation allows for changes to the device's configuration, such as enabling/disabling services and modifying access control lists.
*   **Process Disruption:** By injecting malicious code into the device's logic program, an attacker can disrupt the running process or cause the device to fault.
*   **Potential Code Execution:**  The ability to write a new strategy could be leveraged for code execution.
*   **Denial of Service:**  Modification of the compiled instruction blocks could cause the device to enter a non-recoverable fault state requiring a physical power cycle.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Communication:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted UMAS commands over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the Modicon M580 device.
*   **Understanding of UMAS Protocol:**  The attacker needs to understand the specific UMAS commands and their structure to craft a malicious attack.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is exploitable without authentication.

**Technical Details:**

*   The report details the specific UMAS command sequence required to program a new strategy, including commands like `TAKE_PLC_RESERVATION`, `INITIALIZE_UPLOAD`, `UPLOAD_BLOCK`, and `END_STRATEGY_UPLOAD`.
*   The structure of these commands is provided to show how an attacker can craft them.
*   Two attack scenarios are outlined: unlocking security settings and triggering a device fault.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is in the Modicon M580 Programmable Automation Controller firmware version SV2.70.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Jared Rittle of Cisco Talos.
