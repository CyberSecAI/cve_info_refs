Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7437:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap-based buffer over-read occurs in a `memcpy` call within the `parse_SST` function of FreeXL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer over-read: This occurs when the program attempts to read beyond the allocated memory buffer on the heap.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The vulnerability can lead to a crash due to memory access violation (segmentation fault), effectively causing a denial of service.
-  Specifically a crash occurs when a crafted XLS file is processed by FreeXL.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted Excel (.xls) file: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by creating a specially crafted .xls file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted .xls file as input to an application using the vulnerable FreeXL library. This means they would need to have control over or the ability to influence the data being processed by the vulnerable software. This could be achieved through file uploads, email attachments, or other methods where the attacker can supply the malicious file.
