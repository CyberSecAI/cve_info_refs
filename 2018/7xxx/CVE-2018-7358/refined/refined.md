Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2018-7358:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Improper change control vulnerability. The device does not properly restrict access to functions that allow changes to the device configuration.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to perform actions without needing to authenticate.
*   **Improper Access Restrictions:**  The device doesn't properly restrict access to the `SetSecurityKeys` function, allowing an attacker to modify the Wi-Fi passphrase.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Configuration Changes:** Attackers can change the Wi-Fi passphrase, denying legitimate users access to the network, potentially gaining control of the network or performing other malicious actions.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Although not explicitly stated, changing the wifi password could be classified as a service disruption. The ZTE advisory lists the impact as a loss of availability (A:H)

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** The attack is performed by sending specifically crafted SOAP messages to the device via the UPnP protocol.
*  **Adjacent Network:** The CVSS vector indicates the attack must originate on the same (or adjacent) network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable ZTE ZXHN H168N device or on an adjacent network.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send UPnP requests to the vulnerable device's port 52869.
*   No authentication is required.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

*   **Affected Devices:** ZTE ZXHN H168N with firmware versions V2.2.0\_PK1.2T5, V2.2.0\_PK1.2T2, V2.2.0\_PK11T7, and V2.2.0\_PK11T4.
*   **Exploit Method:** The exploit involves sending SOAP requests to the `/control/igd/wlanc_1_1` endpoint using the UPnP protocol. Specifically, sending a `SetSecurityKeys` SOAP message can change the device's Wi-Fi password.
*   **Solution:**  Disable UPnP or update to the patched version of the firmware, V2.2.0\_PK1.2T6.
