Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2018-7192:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. It arises due to insufficient input sanitization in the `ajax.php` script when handling the `message` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected XSS:** The application reflects user-supplied input directly into the HTML output without proper sanitization. Specifically, the `message` parameter is vulnerable.
- **Missing HttpOnly flag:** The session cookie lacks the `HttpOnly` flag, which makes it accessible to JavaScript. This exacerbates the XSS vulnerability, allowing for session hijacking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- **Session Hijacking:** By exploiting the missing `HttpOnly` flag on the session cookie, an attacker can steal a user's session cookie, potentially leading to account compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Link:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `message` parameter.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker must trick a victim into clicking the malicious link, which then executes the injected JavaScript code when the user hovers over a textbox.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL that exploits the vulnerable `message` parameter in the `ajax.php` script.
- The attacker needs to distribute this URL to a user of the osTicket system.
- No specific user login is required to trigger the initial XSS, but a user who is logged in will be affected with session cookie theft.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided example uses an `onmouseover` event handler to trigger the JavaScript execution when a user hovers the mouse over a text box.
- The attacker can potentially steal session information from the victim due to the missing `HttpOnly` flag.
