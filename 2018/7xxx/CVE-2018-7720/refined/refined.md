Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-7720:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of identity authentication in Cobub Razor, which allows an attacker to create new user accounts via a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack. The application doesn't properly verify the origin of requests to the `/index.php?/user/createNewUser/` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The primary vulnerability is the lack of CSRF protection on the user creation endpoint. This means an attacker can forge a request on behalf of a logged-in administrator.
- **Lack of Identity Authentication:**  The application does not verify the origin of requests, allowing the forged requests to be processed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Account Creation:** An attacker can create new administrative user accounts on the affected Cobub Razor instance. This could lead to complete control of the platform by the attacker.
- **Potential for Further Compromise:** Once the attacker has admin access, they could potentially further compromise the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Web Page:** The attacker crafts a malicious web page that contains a form that submits a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint `/index.php?/user/createNewUser/`.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator user to visit the malicious page. This is typically done via social engineering tactics.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of Target:** The attacker needs to know the URL structure of the target Cobub Razor instance.
- **Ability to Host a Malicious Web Page:** The attacker needs to host a malicious HTML page accessible by the target.
- **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker needs the ability to entice a logged-in administrator to visit their malicious page.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability lies within the `/index.php?/user/createNewUser/` endpoint, specifically when it processes a POST request with the following parameters:
- username
- email
- password
- confirm_password
- userrole

The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how an attacker can craft an HTML form to exploit this. The PoC uses hidden fields to set the values of these parameters, including the `userrole` to `3`, which represents an administrator role.
