Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7547:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability found in the `lyadmin` application.
- Specifically, the `WEB_SITE_TITLE` parameter within the admin page's system settings is vulnerable.
- The application does not properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input before rendering it on the page, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. User-controlled data in the `WEB_SITE_TITLE` parameter is directly output into the HTML without proper sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the webpage.
- **Session hijacking:** By injecting malicious JavaScript, an attacker could steal session cookies, potentially leading to account compromise.
- **Data manipulation:** With a successful XSS attack, an attacker could potentially modify the content displayed, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other actions on behalf of the victim.
- **Defacement:** The attacker could potentially deface the website by displaying malicious content.

**Attack vectors:**

- **HTTP POST request:** The attack is initiated by sending a crafted POST request to the `/admin.php?s=/admin/config/groupsave.html` endpoint.
- **Malicious payload in `WEB_SITE_TITLE` parameter:** The attacker injects the malicious payload as the value of the `config[WEB_SITE_TITLE]` parameter. In the provided example, the payload is `<svg/onload=alert('lyadmin')>`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Access to the admin interface:** The attacker needs to have access to the admin panel of the `lyadmin` application.
- **Ability to craft HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to construct and send HTTP POST requests with the malicious payload.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable parameter `WEB_SITE_TITLE`.

**Additional Details:**
- The content provides specific steps and payload for exploitation, including the vulnerable parameter and the injection point.
- The provided POST data demonstrates how an attacker can inject the XSS payload via the `config[WEB_SITE_TITLE]` parameter.
- It also shows how the injected script is executed when the page is rendered.
