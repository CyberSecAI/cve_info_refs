Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7687:

**CVE Description:** The Micro Focus Client for OES before version 2 SP4 IR8a has a vulnerability that could allow a local attacker to elevate privileges via a buffer overflow in `ncfsd.sys`.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `ncfsd.sys` driver of the Micro Focus Client for Open Enterprise Server (OES).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** A classic buffer overflow vulnerability, where data is written beyond the allocated buffer, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to elevate their privileges, potentially gaining administrative or system-level access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attacker must have local access to the vulnerable system.
- **Exploitation of ncfsd.sys:** The vulnerability exists within the `ncfsd.sys` driver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target system. This means either having a local user account or having already gained some level of access through other means.
- **Understanding of Buffer Overflow:** Some understanding of buffer overflow attacks might be needed to create a working exploit.

**Additional Notes:**
