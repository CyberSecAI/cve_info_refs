Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7877:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap-buffer-overflow occurs in the `getString` function within `util/decompile.c` at line 342. This is triggered during the processing of a crafted SWF file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: The `sprintf` function is used to write data into a heap-allocated buffer. The size of the buffer is insufficient for the data being written, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The heap-buffer-overflow leads to a crash, as observed in the provided ASAN output, thus causing a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious SWF file: The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted SWF file. The attacker needs to provide this malicious file as input to the `swftocxx` tool.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious SWF file to the vulnerable software. The attacker does not need to be local to the vulnerable machine if the software is processing untrusted input over a network.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was found in libming version 0.4.8.
- The provided ASAN output shows the exact location of the overflow and the call stack that leads to it. The overflow occurs when sprintf writes 13 bytes into a 10 byte buffer.
- The issue report on Github provides a link to a proof-of-concept (POC) file.
- The bug report on Debian lists multiple similar issues, further demonstrating the project's lack of security.
