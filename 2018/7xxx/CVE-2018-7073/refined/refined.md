Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7073:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in HPE Moonshot Provisioning Manager (MPM) where an attacker can move arbitrary files using the web interface. The vulnerability lies in the insecure handling of file paths during file move operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Move:** The web interface allows for arbitrary file moves to the MPM upload directory.
- **Insecure File Handling:** The system does not properly validate file paths, allowing an attacker to move files from any location accessible by the server to the upload directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Modification:** An attacker can overwrite or modify files by moving existing files to new locations within the server.
- **Denial of Service:** By moving critical system files, the attacker can potentially cause a denial of service. However, since the web server runs as the user 'moonshot:moonshot', the scope of the damage is limited.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface of the HPE Moonshot Provisioning Manager.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable HPE Moonshot Provisioning Manager.
- **No Authentication Required:** No authentication or credentials are required to execute the attack.

**Additional Details:**

* The Tenable advisory (TRA-2018-15) provides a `curl` command example demonstrating how an attacker can move an arbitrary file using a crafted request.
* The server uses standard `mv` semantics to move the files, which gives the attacker control over target paths and the potential for overwriting existing files.
* The vulnerability allows an attacker to move a file to the upload directory, which can then be retrieved from the URL `https://[target]/upload/`.
* The vulnerability is fixed in HPE Moonshot Provisioning Manager version 1.24 and later.
