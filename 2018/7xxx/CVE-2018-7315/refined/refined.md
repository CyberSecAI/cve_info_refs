Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7315:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability present in the Ek Rishta component for Joomla.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL injection: The component fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries. Specifically, the `gender`, `age1`, `age2`, `religion`, `mothertounge`, `caste`, and `country` parameters in the `alluser` view are vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the vulnerable parameters. This could allow the attacker to:
    - Extract sensitive data from the database (e.g. usernames, passwords, personal information)
    - Modify or delete data
    - Potentially gain control over the database server
    - Compromise the entire Joomla website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable `alluser` view of the `ekrishta` component. Specifically, the following parameters are vulnerable:
    - `gender`
    - `age1`
    - `age2`
    - `religion`
    - `mothertounge`
    - `caste`
    - `country`
- By injecting SQL code into any of these parameters, an attacker can manipulate the SQL query being executed on the backend.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla website.
- No specific authentication or access privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability. The SQL injection is directly exploitable through the public interface to the component.
- The attacker needs to be able to construct a valid SQL injection string for the target SQL database.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided exploit code demonstrates how to extract the database version and database name via the `EXTRACTVALUE` function.
- The vulnerable component has been unpublished from the Joomla Extensions Directory due to a "PE1" error, which likely relates to a policy violation.
- The version of the component confirmed as vulnerable is 2.9.
