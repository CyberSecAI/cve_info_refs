    {
      "CVE": "CVE-2018-7544",
      "Root cause": "A cross-protocol issue exists in the OpenVPN management interface.",
      "Weaknesses": "The management interface executes every line as a command without proper validation.",
      "Impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary management commands, leading to information disclosure (e.g., network interface configuration) or denial of service (e.g., by terminating the client).",
      "Attack vector": "By sending a multipart/form-data request to the management interface.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP request to the OpenVPN management interface. The port used by the interface may need to be brute forced."
