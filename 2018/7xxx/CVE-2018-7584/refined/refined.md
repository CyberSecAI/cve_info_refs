{
  "CVE-2018-7584": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a stack-based buffer under-read in the `php_stream_url_wrap_http_ex` function within `ext/standard/http_fopen_wrapper.c` when parsing an HTTP response. Specifically, the code decrements `tmp_line_len` without proper bounds checking, potentially leading to a negative index when accessing `tmp_line`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer under-read",
      "Improper bounds checking"
    ],
    "impact": "This can lead to a stack-based buffer under-read, followed by an attempt to copy a large string from the stack to a heap buffer, leading to memory corruption and potentially a denial of service (DoS), or control flow hijacking may be possible.",
    "attack_vectors": "By sending a specially crafted HTTP response to a PHP application that uses `file_get_contents` or similar functions to fetch data via HTTP.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the content of the HTTP response which is parsed by PHP. The attacker does not require any form of authentication."
