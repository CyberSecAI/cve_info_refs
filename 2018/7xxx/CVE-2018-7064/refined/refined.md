- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the web interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected XSS
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can trick an administrator into clicking a link. This could allow the attacker to take administrative actions on the device or expose a session cookie for an administrative session, potentially compromising confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access to the affected system. Requires tricking an administrator into clicking a crafted link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Network access. The attacker does not require system privileges but needs to trick a user to click a link.
