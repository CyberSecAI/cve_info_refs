Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7551:

**Verification:**

The provided content includes a Debian security advisory (DLA 1340-1) that explicitly mentions CVE-2018-7551 as one of the vulnerabilities fixed in the `sam2p` package. Additionally, the Debian bug report #891527 and the associated GitHub issue #28 confirm the presence of a vulnerability in `sam2p` that aligns with the description of a memory corruption issue.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is an invalid free operation within the `MiniPS::delete0` function, specifically when processing a crafted input file. This indicates a double-free or an attempt to free memory that was not allocated by `malloc`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Invalid Free**:  The core issue is attempting to `free` memory that was not allocated using `malloc`. This can happen in various scenarios, such as attempting to free a stack variable or memory already freed. This is a memory corruption vulnerability.
- **Heap-based Buffer Overflow**: While the primary issue described is an invalid free, the initial bug report also mentions heap-based buffer overflows in `sam2p` versions 0.49.2 - 0.49.4, which suggests a broader class of memory management issues are present. This implies a potential for overflowing allocated memory buffers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service, causing the `sam2p` application to crash due to a segmentation fault.
- **Unspecified Other Impact**: The security advisory mentions "unspecified other impact", which could include other forms of memory corruption with unpredictable results, potentially leading to further exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Crafted Input File**: The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted input file. Specifically, the provided example uses a file that, when processed with `sam2p`, leads to a double free, causing the crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Input File**: An attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious input file to the `sam2p` application. This could be done through various means, such as having the application process user-provided input, or by exploiting another vulnerability to inject or influence the input of `sam2p`.
- **User Execution**: The attacker typically would need a user to execute the vulnerable `sam2p` binary, either directly or indirectly (e.g. via a script, another program).

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided GitHub issue #28 demonstrates the vulnerability via a crash with Address Sanitizer (`ASAN`) output, showcasing the invalid free within `MiniPS::delete0`.
- The Debian bug report mentions multiple related issues in the same code base, some of which have been resolved in the Debian LTS release that included fixes for this CVE.
- The issues stem from memory management issues within sam2p's processing of PostScript data.

In summary, CVE-2018-7551 relates to an invalid free vulnerability in the `sam2p` image conversion utility, triggered by specially crafted input files, leading to a denial-of-service.
