Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the disclosure of the full physical path of the web server in two files: `includes/mysql2i/mysql2i.func.php` and `addons/phpmailer/phpmailer.php`. The exact mechanism of how the path is disclosed isn't specified here, but the screenshots hint that it's through some type of output, possibly an error message or debug information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the full server-side file system path in error messages, debug information, or similar output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Leakage:** An attacker can learn the exact physical location of the web application's files on the server. This information can be leveraged to discover other vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the system.
- **Increased Attack Surface:** Knowing the exact path can aid in further attacks, making it easier for an attacker to craft exploits or locate sensitive files if they discover another vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker could potentially trigger an error or access a debug mode that reveals the server path through the two mentioned files.
- This information would be gained passively as the application reveals the path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to interact with the application to trigger the path disclosure through the two mentioned files.
- No high level of access is required; the attacker needs the ability to send a malformed request to the server to trigger the vulnerability through the web interface.

**Additional notes:**
The description notes "Rows : 10", which might suggest the vulnerability is within the first 10 lines of the file, but this is not conclusive.
The content is related to a path disclosure vulnerability but doesn't explicitly state the vulnerable code.
