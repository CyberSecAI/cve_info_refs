Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `username` parameter in the login request to `login.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection, meaning that the attacker cannot directly see the results of their SQL queries in the application's response. Instead, they must infer information based on timing or error responses.
- **Time-based SQL Injection:** The provided payload indicates the vulnerability can be exploited via time-based blind SQLi by utilizing the `RANDOMBLOB` function, which can cause a delay in query execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:**  An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database. The CVSS score indicates a low impact on confidentiality and integrity, suggesting limited data access or modification capabilities. The confidentiality and integrity impacts are both rated as "Low".
- The provided CVSS vector string is: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:L/MPR:N/MUI:N/MS:U/MC:L/MI:L/MA:N
- **No Availability Impact:** The exploit does not affect the availability of the application

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network via HTTP requests, as seen in the example `POST /login.php` request.
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by crafting malicious SQL queries within the username parameter of an HTTP POST request to the `login.php` endpoint

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not require any prior authentication or user privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable application.
- **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to send crafted HTTP POST requests.
