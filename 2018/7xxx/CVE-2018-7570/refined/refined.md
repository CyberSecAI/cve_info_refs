Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7570:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**
   - The provided content directly mentions CVE-2018-7570 in the descriptions and SUSE advisories, confirming its relevance to the CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - A null pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the `assign_file_positions_for_non_load_sections` function within `elf.c` of the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library.
   - The vulnerability occurs when processing an ELF file containing a RELRO segment that lacks a corresponding LOAD segment.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Null Pointer Dereference:** The code dereferences a potentially null pointer (`lm`) leading to a crash.
   - **Improper Handling of ELF Segments:** The vulnerability highlights the code's insufficient handling of scenarios where a RELRO segment is present without a corresponding LOAD segment.
   - The code assumes the `lm` (load segment) pointer will never be NULL after the assertion, which is not always the case.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation leads to a program crash due to a null pointer dereference, disrupting normal operation of affected tools like `objcopy`.
   - **Application Crash:** The program terminates unexpectedly because of accessing an invalid memory location.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Crafted ELF File:** The attack vector involves providing a specially crafted ELF file to the vulnerable tool. This ELF file must contain a RELRO segment but lacks a matching LOAD segment.
    - The vulnerability is triggered through use of `objcopy`, `nm`, and `objdump`.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Ability to Provide Malicious Input:** The attacker must be able to supply the vulnerable tool (like objcopy, nm, objdump) with a maliciously crafted ELF file. This often means the attacker would need some degree of access or means of influencing the files a user processes with the tool.
   - **User Interaction:** The user needs to run the vulnerable binutils tool on the crafted file.
   - **Local Access:** The SUSE analysis suggests the exploit occurs when the attacker has local access, which implies being able to provide a crafted file as input.

**Additional Notes:**
   - The provided text offers more detail than the official CVE description. It includes the specific function, and conditional cause of the vulnerability.
    - The sourceware bugzilla report includes example code demonstrating the vulnerability.
   - SUSE's analysis classifies this as a local attack vector with a required user interaction, indicating an end user could be tricked into processing a malicious file.
   - SUSE highlights that binutils is a developer tool meant to process trusted input, and recommends that untrusted binaries be processed in an isolated system or VM.
   - The fix for this vulnerability, according to the sourceware commit, removes the RELRO segment if there is no matching LOAD segment.

**Summary of Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** Null pointer dereference in `assign_file_positions_for_non_load_sections` due to a missing LOAD segment for a RELRO segment in an ELF file.
*   **Vulnerability:** The code improperly handles RELRO segments without a LOAD segment.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (application crash).
*   **Attack Vector:** Crafted ELF file.
*  **Required Capabilities:** Ability to supply a crafted ELF file to the vulnerable tool (objcopy, nm, objdump). Local access. User Interaction (to process file).
