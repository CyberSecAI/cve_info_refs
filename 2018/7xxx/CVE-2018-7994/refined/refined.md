Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a memory leak in the software when processing Protal questionnaires. The software fails to release allocated memory properly.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Memory Leak. The software does not release allocated memory after processing a Protal questionnaire.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A remote attacker sending a large number of Protal questionnaires to the affected device can cause it to run out of memory, leading to a reboot (Denial of Service).
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is remote. An attacker sends a large volume of specially crafted Protal questionnaires to the targeted device over the network.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must pass the IKE authentication before exploiting the memory leak. They must be able to send network packets to the targeted device.
