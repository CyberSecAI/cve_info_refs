Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7162:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the TLS implementation within Node.js. Specifically, the issue arises when the TLS server receives duplicate or unexpected messages during the handshake process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness lies in the insufficient handling of unexpected handshake messages within the TLS implementation of Node.js. This can cause a crash in the node process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. An attacker can crash a Node.js process acting as an HTTP server with TLS support.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves sending crafted TLS messages that are either duplicates or unexpected during the TLS handshake process to a vulnerable Node.js server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send network messages to a Node.js server that is configured to use TLS. They must also be able to craft messages that are either duplicates or unexpected during the TLS handshake.

**Affected Versions:**
- Node.js versions 9.x and 10.x are vulnerable.
- Node.js versions 6.x and 8.x are NOT vulnerable.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is considered HIGH severity.
- The vulnerability was addressed by updating the TLS implementation.
