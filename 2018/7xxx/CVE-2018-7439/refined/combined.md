BTW1: I'll try to add other dictionaries this week.

Thanks!  > At the end of license.txt file, in babylon software (under the section TERMS OF USE OF BABYLON.COM GLOSSARIES AND OTHER THIRD PARTY MATERIAL), it stated that Glossaries and Third Party material is provided "AS-IS".  That may be true for the current releases, but the dictionaries babytrans uses are from an old one. By the time the babytrans project appeared (I've been using it for many years), the "legal" (recommended by the author) way of installing dictionaries was to download the windows version, install it and copy the dictionaries over to your linux partition. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Evgeny Stambulchik    2004-09-22 01:04:36 UTC  ``` PS. Please unmask babytrans* on amd64. I've been using it for half a year here with no probs. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Otavio Piske (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-09-22 13:53:13 UTC  ``` > That may be true for the current releases, but the dictionaries babytrans uses are from an old one.

Thanks for pointing that. I added fetch restrictions to the dictionaries ebuilds and I'll contact babylon to see how we can handle this in a legal way. About unmasking in amd64: I recommend talking to someone on the amd64 team. If that doesn't help, ping me on #gentoo-dev and I'll try to help. ``` |  |
