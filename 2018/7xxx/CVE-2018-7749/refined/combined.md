|  |  | Change Log |
|  |  | ========== |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Release 1.12.1 (10 Mar 2018) |
|  |  | ---------------------------- |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \* Implemented a fix for CVE-2018-7749, where a modified SSH client could |
|  |  | request that an AsyncSSH server perform operations before authentication |
|  |  | had completed. Thanks go to Matthijs Kooijman for discovering and |
|  |  | reporting this issue and helping to review the fix. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \* Added a non-blocking collect\_output() method to SSHClientProcess to |
|  |  | allow applications to retrieve data received on an output stream |
|  |  | without blocking. This call can be called multiple times and freely |
|  |  | intermixed with regular read calls with a guarantee that output will |
|  |  | always be returned in order and without duplication. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \* Updated debug logging implementation to make it more maintainable, and |
|  |  | to fix an issue where unprocessed packets were not logged in some cases. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \* Extended the support below for non-ASCII characters in comments to apply |
|  |  | to X.509 certificates, allowing an optional encoding to be passed in to |
|  |  | get\_comment() and set\_comment() and a get\_comment\_bytes() function to |
|  |  | get the raw comment bytes without performing Unicode decoding. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \* Fixed an issue where a UnicodeDecodeError could be reported in some |
|  |  | cases instead of a KeyEncryptionError when a private key was imported |
|  |  | using the wrong passphrase. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \* Fixed the reporting of the MAC algorithm selected during key exchange to |
|  |  | properly report the cipher name for GCM and Chacha ciphers that don't |
|  |  | use a separate MAC algorithm. The correct value was being returned in |
|  |  | queries after the key exchange was complete, but the logging was being |
|  |  | done before this adjustment was made. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \* Fixed the documentation of connection\_made() in SSHSession subclasses |
|  |  | to properly reflect the type of SSHChannel objects passed to them. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Release 1.12.0 (5 Feb 2018) |
