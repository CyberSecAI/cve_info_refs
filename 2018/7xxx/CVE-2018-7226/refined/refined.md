{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in `len + 1` calculation within `vcSetXCutTextProc` function, leading to heap overflow. Lack of NULL check after malloc also contributing.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Heap overflow",
      "Unchecked malloc return value"
    ],
    "impact": "Heap overflow, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution if exploited correctly. Service crash due to invalid memory access.",
    "attack_vectors": "Sending a specially crafted RFB message with large `length` field can trigger the vulnerability.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted RFB messages to the vulnerable server. No specific authentication is required, since the vulnerability can be triggered even without authentication."
