Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-7675

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a session management issue in the Sentinel Web Interface. After a user's session times out due to inactivity, the interface doesn't properly clear the previous user's session data before allowing a new login.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is information disclosure. The web interface fails to clear the previous user's session data upon timeout, so that when another user logs in, they are presented with the previous user's view. This could include sensitive information like events or configuration details.
- **Improper Session Handling:** The root cause is the failure of the web application to properly invalidate sessions upon timeout.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Information Access:** An unauthorized user could potentially view another user's sensitive data displayed on the screen before the new user's login. This data could include event logs, configuration settings, or other user-specific information.
- **Potential Security Breach:** Depending on the sensitivity of the data displayed, this could lead to a more significant security breach if the exposed information reveals vulnerabilities or sensitive configuration details.
- **Compromised Confidentiality:** The confidentiality of user data and system configurations is compromised.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Idle Session Timeout:** An attacker does not need to perform a technical attack, the vector is related to user behavior and timing.
- **Subsequent Login:** An attacker must be present and login shortly after a legitimate user's session has timed out to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Physical or Network Access:** The attacker needs to have physical or network access to the system where Sentinel is running.
- **Timeliness:** The attacker must be able to log in to the system soon after a legitimate user's session has timed out.
- **Valid Login Credentials:** The attacker must have valid login credentials to access the Sentinel Web Interface.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided information is more detailed than the typical CVE description, as it explains the specific scenario and the resulting information disclosure.
- The resolution involves obtaining a private patch or upgrading to a later version of Sentinel.
