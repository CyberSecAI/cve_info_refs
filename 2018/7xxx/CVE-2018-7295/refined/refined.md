- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Final Fantasy XIV launcher application (ffxivlauncher.exe) requests a remote URL via HTTP instead of HTTPS during the login process. The response is then rendered inside the launcher.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is caused by Improper Enforcement of Message Integrity During Transmission in a Communication Channel (CWE-924). Specifically, the launcher does not properly secure the initial login page request, which is done over HTTP.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A man-in-the-middle attacker can intercept the initial HTTP request for the login page, modify the response, and redirect the user to a fake login page. This allows the attacker to steal the victim's username, password, and one-time password (if configured).
- **Attack vectors:** A man-in-the-middle attack is required, where the attacker intercepts and modifies the initial HTTP request for the login page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and modify network traffic between the user's computer and the server hosting the initial login page content. This would typically require the attacker to be on the same network as the victim or have the ability to route traffic through a malicious server they control.
