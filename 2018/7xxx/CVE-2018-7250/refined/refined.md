Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `secdrv.sys` driver, specifically related to an uninitialized kernel pool allocation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-   **Uninitialized Kernel Pool Allocation:** When the driver handles IOCTL 0xCA002813, it allocates a chunk of memory from the kernel's PagedPool but fails to initialize it. This leads to a state where the memory contains data from previous operations.
-   **Information Leak:** The allocated but uninitialized memory is copied to user mode, resulting in a 16-bit information leak. This leaked data consists of remnants from previous kernel operations, potentially exposing sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially read arbitrary kernel memory, as the uninitialized pool allocation could contain sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Local Attack:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have access to the vulnerable system.
-   **IOCTL Call:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending IOCTL code 0xCA002813 to the `secdrv.sys` driver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Unprivileged Local User:** The attacker does not need elevated privileges to trigger the vulnerability, making it accessible to a wider range of potential attackers.
-   **Ability to Send IOCTL:** The attacker needs to be able to send IOCTL requests to the vulnerable driver.

**Additional Notes:**
-   The vulnerability affects older Windows versions (Vista, 7, 8, and 8.1 before KB3086255).
-   Microsoft has reportedly decided not to fix the vulnerability in older versions of Windows because the vulnerability does not affect up-to-date systems.
-   The provided GitHub repository also links to CVE-2018-7249, which may contain related details, although this content primarily focuses on CVE-2018-7250.

This information provides more technical details than the original CVE description, specifying the IOCTL code and the precise nature of the information leak (16 bits from PagedPool).
