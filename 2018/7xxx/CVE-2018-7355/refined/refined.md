Based on the provided content, here's the analysis for CVE-2018-7355:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Incomplete input validation in the handling of the "cmd" parameter within the `/goform/goform_get_cmd_process` page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*   Client-side script execution or HTML code injection due to lack of sanitization of user-supplied input.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Attackers can inject and execute malicious JavaScript code or HTML on the victim's browser.
*   This can potentially lead to:
    *   Data theft.
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Malware delivery.
    *   Defacement of the web interface.
    *   Other malicious actions that can be performed through JavaScript execution within the context of the vulnerable web page.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through crafted URLs containing malicious JavaScript code or HTML within the `cmd` parameter of the `/goform/goform_get_cmd_process` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and deliver it to a victim user who is logged into the device's web interface.
*   The attacker does not need to have prior access or credentials, as this is a reflected XSS.

**Additional Information**
*   The affected devices include ZTE MF65 and MF65M1.
*   The vulnerable firmware versions are MF65 V1.0.0B05 and MF65M1 V1.0.0B02.
*   ZTE recommends that users replace these devices with newer products, as these devices are end-of-service and will not receive patches.
*   The vulnerability is rated as Medium severity with a CVSS 3.0 Base Score of 4.6 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) which is incorrect based on the common CVSS scoring metrics. A reflected XSS attack should have a UI:R requirement and a lower confidentiality impact. A more accurate CVSS score based on the attack vector and impact would be (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N) which scores a 6.1.
