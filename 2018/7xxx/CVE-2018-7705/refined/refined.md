Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-7705:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The application lacks proper path traversal checks. This means that the application does not sanitize or validate user-supplied file paths, allowing an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to manipulate file paths to access or modify files outside of the intended scope. Specifically, the application uses encrypted files for data storage, and the lack of path traversal checks allows an attacker to access and modify these files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Reading Arbitrary Emails:** A legitimate recipient can read emails sent to other recipients in plain text by manipulating file paths.
*   **Overwriting Email Content:** It is possible to overwrite the message body of an email by exploiting the path traversal vulnerability during file uploads.
*   **Data Breach:** Exploiting this vulnerability could lead to a significant data breach by exposing sensitive email content.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST request manipulation:** By crafting a specific POST request to `/secupload2/upload.aspx`, an attacker can overwrite message bodies of other emails by manipulating the `filename` parameter with path traversal sequences such as `../`.
*   **HTTP GET parameter manipulation:** A specially crafted GET request to `/secmail/getmessage.exe` with the `option2` parameter containing a path traversal sequence allows access to arbitrary message bodies.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be a legitimate recipient of emails within the system.
*   The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable SecurEnvoy server.
*   The attacker needs to know or guess the sequential message IDs to target specific emails.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is demonstrated by the following POST request that overwrites the body of the email with ID 107 while uploading the body of message with ID 103:
    ```
    POST /secupload2/upload.aspx HTTP/1.1
    Host: <host>
    Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=--------822119548
    Content-Length: 309

    ----------822119548
    Content-Disposition: form-data; name="FileName"

    x
    ----------822119548
    Content-Disposition: form-data; name="MessageID"

    103
    ----------822119548
    Content-Disposition: form-data; filename="../107/BODY"
    Content-Type: application/octet-stream

    some message
    ----------822119548--
    ```

*   The vulnerability can also be exploited using the following GET request to retrieve the message body with ID 107 using access to email with ID 103:
    ```
    http://<host>/secmail/getmessage.exe?mailboxid=<mailbox-id>&action=attachment&option1=103&option2=../107/BODY
    ```
