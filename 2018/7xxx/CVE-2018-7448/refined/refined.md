Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7448:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the CMS Made Simple installer, specifically during the database setup stage (step 4). The installer allows for the injection of arbitrary PHP code into the `timezone` parameter, which is then written to the `config.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Code Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject malicious PHP code through the `timezone` parameter. This is possible because the input is not properly sanitized or validated before being written to the configuration file.
*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The installer forces write permissions (777) to the destination directory and related installation files which makes the system vulnerable to modification by the attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By injecting PHP code into the `config.php` file, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server by accessing the modified `config.php` file with a crafted `cmd` parameter to execute OS commands. This allows the attacker to run arbitrary system commands on the server.
*   **Full System Compromise:** RCE can lead to a full compromise of the system, allowing the attacker to access sensitive data, install malware, or perform other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-Based Attack:** The attack is performed through a web browser by accessing the CMS Made Simple installer script.
*   **Form Parameter Injection:** The malicious code is injected through the `timezone` parameter in a POST request to the installer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Installer:** The attacker needs to be able to access the CMS Made Simple installer script. This typically requires a fresh installation process.
*   **Intercepting/Modifying Request:** The attacker needs to intercept the installation request to modify the `timezone` parameter with malicious PHP code. This can be done using a proxy tool.
*   **Valid Database Credentials:** The attacker needs valid database credentials to progress through the installation process up to step 4.
*   **Basic understanding of HTTP requests and PHP:** The attacker needs to be able to craft an HTTP request containing the malicious PHP code and the desired OS command.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.2 of CMS Made Simple.
*   The exploit requires a fresh install to work as the installer is not accessible after the initial installation has been completed.
*   The injected code uses the `system()` function to execute OS commands, making the system highly vulnerable.
