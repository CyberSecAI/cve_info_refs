    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the device's web interface, which will be executed when a user accesses the page via their browser while configuring the unit. This could allow the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user and potentially compromise the device's configuration or the network itself.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is network-based. An attacker would need to inject the malicious script through a crafted request to the web interface of the affected device.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to send network requests to the device's web management interface. The attacker would likely need to be on the same network segment as the device or have the ability to route to it.  The attacker would need knowledge of the specific parameters or areas of the web interface that are vulnerable to script injection."
