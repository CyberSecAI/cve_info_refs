Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `track_import_export.php` script of Schneider Electric U.Motion Builder.
- The script fails to properly validate and sanitize user-supplied input to the `object_id` HTTP GET/POST parameter.
- This lack of validation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into a PHP `exec` call.
- This is a bypass of a fix implemented for CVE-2018-7765.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unauthenticated Command Injection (CWE-78):** The primary weakness is the ability to inject and execute arbitrary operating system commands due to insufficient input sanitization.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not properly validate user-supplied data, leading to the injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands, potentially leading to the complete compromise of the affected system.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** The attacker can gain access to sensitive data, modify system configurations, or render the system unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET/POST parameter `object_id`:** The vulnerability is triggered by injecting malicious code into this parameter.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network-level access to a vulnerable instance of U.Motion Builder or a product that depends on it.
- **Unauthenticated:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable U.Motion Builder system.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered and researched by Julien Ahrens from RCE Security.
- The affected versions include Schneider Electric U.Motion Builder 1.3.4 and below.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) was provided that uses `sleep 10` to demonstrate the ability to execute arbitrary commands.
- The vendor retired the product shortly after notification, so no fix was made available.
- The vulnerability was assigned a CVSS v3 score of 9.8 (Critical).
