Here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2018-7642 from the provided documents:

**1. Description of Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the `swap_std_reloc_in` function within `aoutx.h` of the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (libbfd).
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation which leads to a NULL pointer dereference when processing a crafted ELF file.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The primary impact is a denial of service (DoS) caused by an application crash.
*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers can exploit this by providing a malicious ELF file.
*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:**  Attackers need the ability to provide a malicious crafted ELF file to be processed by vulnerable software. 

**2. Technical Details**

*   The `swap_std_reloc_in` function is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference because of the improper handling of relocations within a crafted aoutx object file. Specifically, when attempting to access a section via `sym->section->output_section` within this function when `sym` is NULL.
*   The vulnerability is reproducible by using objcopy.
*   This is related to the upstream bug report at <https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=22887>

**3. Affected Products**

*   Multiple SUSE Linux Enterprise products. 
*   openSUSE Leap 15.0 and 15.1
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
*   Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11 (indirectly through affected container images)

**4. Fix Information**

*   Patches were applied to fix the NULL pointer dereference in `aoutx.h`.
*   SUSE and Red Hat have released updates including the patch.
*   The fix involves adding a check to ensure that the symbol `sym` is not NULL before attempting to access its members.
*   The fix for this issue has been backported to multiple versions of binutils.

**5. CVE Details from SUSE, Red Hat and Gentoo**

*   **SUSE:** This vulnerability is considered a low-severity issue. SUSE emphasizes that binutils is a developer tool not intended to process untrusted input, hence updates are typically released less often. They recommend processing untrusted code using binutils within isolated environments such as virtual machines.
*   **Red Hat:** This vulnerability is considered a low-severity issue. Red Hat provides a security advisory (RHSA-2018:3032) which includes this fix and several others related to binutils.
*   **Gentoo:** This vulnerability is rated as normal severity and can be triggered remotely. Gentoo states that several other vulnerabilities were also fixed in this release.

**Summary**

The content consistently points to a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in the `swap_std_reloc_in` function that could lead to a DoS via a specially crafted ELF file. All sources agree on the root cause, attack vector and impact. Updates are available from multiple distributions to address this issue.
