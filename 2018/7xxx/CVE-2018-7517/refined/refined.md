The provided content is related to CVE-2018-7517.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds write during the parsing of malformed project files by CX-Supervisor.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787)

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow remote code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves parsing specially crafted, malformed project files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to provide a malformed project file to the vulnerable software. The advisory states that this vulnerability is not exploitable remotely, implying a need for local access. The CVSS vector string ([AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)) confirms this as it indicates Local access is required (AV:L) and User Interaction is required (UI:R). The advisory also notes that a low skill level is needed to exploit.
