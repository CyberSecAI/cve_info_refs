Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-7868:

**Root Cause:**

- The root cause is a heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability in the `getName` function located in `util/decompile.c`. Specifically, this occurs when processing `CONSTANT8` data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Heap-based buffer over-read:** The `getName` function attempts to read beyond the allocated buffer boundaries on the heap. This is triggered when processing `CONSTANT8` data within a crafted SWF file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service condition. The over-read can cause the application to crash or become unstable.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Crafted SWF File:** The attack vector is a maliciously crafted SWF file designed to trigger the over-read in the vulnerable `getName` function.
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by processing the crafted SWF file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to create a crafted SWF file:** The attacker must be able to create or modify an SWF file to contain the specific data structures and formatting to exploit the heap buffer over-read in `getName`.
- **Ability to deliver the crafted SWF file:** The attacker needs a way to make the vulnerable application process the crafted SWF file. This could involve tricking a user into opening a malicious SWF file or embedding it in a website that a user visits.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was discovered in libming version 0.4.8.
- The specific line of code where the over-read occurs is `util/decompile.c:398`.
- The `getName` function is called during the process of decompiling SWF files to extract information about names.
- The vulnerability is triggered specifically when processing `CONSTANT8` data within the SWF file's data structures.
