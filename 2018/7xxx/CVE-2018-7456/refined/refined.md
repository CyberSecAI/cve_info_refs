  "CVE-2018-7456": {
    "description": "It was discovered that LibTIFF incorrectly handled certain malformed images. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted image, a remote attacker could crash the application, leading to a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges.",
    "root_cause": "NULL Pointer Dereference in the TIFFPrintDirectory function (tif_print.c) when using the tiffinfo tool to print crafted TIFF information.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of malformed images",
       "NULL pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (crash the application), possibly arbitrary code execution with user privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Opening a specially crafted image file"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to trick a user or automated system into opening the malformed image"
    ],
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability is triggered in the way tags are handled when printing them from a specially crafted TIFF file. The vulnerability is due to the function TIFFPrintDirectory relying on assumptions about the Transfer Function field and SamplesPerPixel. The fix involves adding a new 'i < 3' end condition to the broken TIFFPrintDirectory loop and a loop condition 'i < td->td_samplesperpixel - td->td_extrasamples'."
