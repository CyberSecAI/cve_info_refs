# Flight Sim Company Embeds Malware to Steal Pirates’ Passwords

February 19, 2018 by
[Andy Maxwell](https://torrentfreak.com/author/andy/)

[Home](https://torrentfreak.com "Go to TorrentFreak.") > [News](https://torrentfreak.com/category/news/ "Go to the News category archives.") >

Flight sim company FlightSimLabs has found itself in trouble after installing malware onto users' machines as an anti-piracy measure. Code embedded in its A320-X module contained a mechanism for detecting 'pirate' serial numbers distributed on The Pirate Bay, which then triggered a process through which the company stole usernames and passwords from users' web browsers.

[![](https://torrentfreak.com/images/warning.png)](/images/warning.png)Anti-piracy systems and DRM come in all shapes and sizes, none of them particularly popular, but one deployed by flight sim company FlightSimLabs is likely to go down in history as one of the most outrageous.

It all started yesterday on Reddit when Flight Sim user ‘crankyrecursion’ reported a little extra something in his download of FlightSimLabs’ A320X module.

“Using file ‘FSLabs\_A320X\_P3D\_v2.0.1.231.exe’ there seems to be a file called ‘test.exe’ included,” crankyrecursion [wrote](https://www.reddit.com/r/flightsim/comments/7yh4zu/fslabs_a320_installer_seems_to_include_a_chrome/).

“This .exe file is from http://securityxploded.com and is touted as a ‘Chrome Password Dump’ tool, which seems to work – particularly as the installer would typically run with Administrative rights (UAC prompts) on Windows Vista and above. Can anyone shed light on why this tool is included in a supposedly trusted installer?”

The existence of a Chrome password dumping tool is certainly cause for alarm, especially if the software had been obtained from a less-than-official source, such as a torrent or similar site, given the potential for third-party pollution.

However, with the possibility of a nefarious third-party dumping something nasty in a pirate release still lurking on the horizon, things took an unexpected turn. FlightSimLabs chief Lefteris Kalamaras made a statement basically admitting that his company was behind the malware installation.

“We were made aware there is a Reddit thread started tonight regarding our latest installer and how a tool is included in it, that indiscriminately dumps Chrome passwords. That is not correct information – in fact, the Reddit thread was posted by a person who is not our customer and has somehow obtained our installer without purchasing,” Kalamaras [wrote](https://forums.flightsimlabs.com/index.php?/announcement/10-a320-x-drm-clarification/).

“[T]here are no tools used to reveal any sensitive information of any customer who has legitimately purchased our products. We all realize that you put a lot of trust in our products and this would be contrary to what we believe.

“There is a specific method used against specific serial numbers that have been identified as pirate copies and have been making the rounds on ThePirateBay, RuTracker and other such malicious sites,” he added.

In a nutshell, FlightSimLabs installed a password dumper onto ALL users’ machines, whether they were pirates or not, but then only activated the password-stealing module when it determined that specific ‘pirate’ serial numbers had been used which matched those on FlightSimLabs’ servers.

“Test.exe is part of the DRM and is only targeted against specific pirate copies of copyrighted software obtained illegally. That program is only extracted temporarily and is never under any circumstances used in legitimate copies of the product,” Kalamaras added.

That didn’t impress Luke Gorman, who published an [analysis](https://medium.com/%40lukegorman97/flightsimlabs-alleged-malware-analysis-1427c4d23368) slamming the flight sim company for knowingly installing password-stealing malware on users machines, even those who purchased the title legitimately.

Making matters even worse, the FlightSimLabs chief went on to say that information being obtained from pirates’ machines in this manner is likely to be used in court or other legal processes.

“This method has already successfully provided information that we’re going to use in our ongoing legal battles against such criminals,” Kalamaras revealed.

While the use of the extracted passwords and usernames elsewhere will remain to be seen, it appears that FlightSimLabs has had a change of heart. With immediate effect, the company is pointing customers to a new installer that doesn’t include code for stealing their most sensitive data.

“I want to reiterate and reaffirm that we as a company and as flight simmers would never do anything to knowingly violate the trust that you have placed in us by not only buying our products but supporting them and FlightSimLabs,” Kalamaras said in an update.

“While the majority of our customers understand that the fight against piracy is a difficult and ongoing battle that sometimes requires drastic measures, we realize that a few of you were uncomfortable with this particular method which might be considered to be a bit heavy handed on our part. It is for this reason we have uploaded an updated installer that does not include the DRM check file in question.”

Further analysis of the ‘DRM’ [has been published](https://www.fidusinfosec.com/fslabs-flight-simulation-labs-dropping-malware-to-combat-piracy/) by Fidus.

**Update Feb 20:** FlightSimLabs has issued [another statement](https://forums.flightsimlabs.com/index.php?/announcement/11-a320-x-drm-what-happened/), this time much more detailed, which explains that the company was targeting a specific cracker of their games.

*“Flash back to our first A320-X release for FSX / P3Dv3 (32bit) – we discovered soon after the release of our product for those simulator versions that there were specific crackers who were successful in sidetracking our protection system by using offline serial number generators.*

We could not find how this would happen, but we happened upon a particular set of information (username / email / serial number) that would occur recurrently from specific IP addresses.

We tried to add more tests in our subsequent installer releases, but the specific crackers were also upping their game in ensuring they sidetracked our installer. We even went so far as to figure out exactly who the cracker was (we have his name available upon request of any authorities), but unfortunately we could not be able to enter the registration-only web sites he was using to provide this information to other pirates.

We found through the IP addresses tracked that the particular cracker had used Chrome to contact our servers so we decided to capture his information directly – and ONLY his information (obviously, we understand now that people got very upset about this – we’re very sorry once again!) as we had a very good idea of what serial number the cracker used in his efforts.”

> **UPDATE:** *Two updates can be found at the bottom of this article revealing the findings from Fidus InfoSec and FSLabs’ response to the situation.*

On Sunday 18th February 2018, a [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/flightsim/comments/7yh4zu/fslabs_a320_installer_seems_to_include_a_chrome/) appeared claiming that the FSLabs A320 installer included a Google Chrome password extraction tool.

This came as a concern to paying FlightSimLabs customers, wondering whether or not these allegations were true.

[**‘crankyrecursion’**](https://www.reddit.com/r/flightsim/comments/7yh4zu/fslabs_a320_installer_seems_to_include_a_chrome/) made the discovery that a file called ‘test.exe’ was extracted onto the end users’ computer upon running the FSLabs A320 installation .exe. Running this file results in the Chrome login file being automatically located, and the usernames and passwords are dumped into a console screen:

![]()

I extracted the installer myself and can confirm that test.exe file is located with a temporary folder ({tmp}) when extracted with the innounp extraction tool.

Okay, FSLabs have my Chrome passwords now. Not exactly. According to Lefteris Kalamaras, this file is not executed provided that you are a paying customer, hinting that this is an anti piracy measure.

**Whats the problem?**The problem lies with the fact that ‘test.exe’, malware, is extracted and placed onto the end users system without their consent. The file is in no doubt classified as malware, as it has malicious intent to gather all usernames and passwords within Google Chrome.

**But this only affects pirates, right?**This isn’t my point. The point is that when a piece of malware is placed onto a system, with the user not being aware of the fact, and having paid $150+ for the privilege. How do we know that FSLabs don’t use this, just because they say so? Oh they also ask you to kindly turn off your anti virus before installing. I wonder why. This is a violation of software ethics, and more than likely illegal. If I could be bothered I would do the legal research, but that’s also not my point.

*To recap, malware is being placed onto a users system during the extraction phase after the execution of the installer .exe. This is my problem.*

Lefteris’ statement [can be found here.](https://forums.flightsimlabs.com/index.php?%2Fannouncement%2F10-a320-x-drm-clarification%2F=)

**What is it that annoyed me so much about FSLabs’ response?**

> “1) First of all — there are no tools used to reveal any sensitive information of any customer who has legitimately purchased our products. We all realize that you put a lot of trust in our products and this would be contrary to what we believe.”

First of all, there is a tool to reveal sensitive information (website credentials are classed as personal data) of customers who legitimately purchased FSLabs’ products, as the file to do this is placed onto the end users system at the point of execution (I’m repeating myself, aren’t I? You need to understand this point). This is an outright lie. Okay, maybe it isn’t **used** but it is still there to be exploited.

> “2) There is a specific method used against specific serial numbers that have been identified as pirate copies and have been making the rounds on ThePirateBay, RuTracker and other such malicious sites.”

Piracy is wrong, yes. But is collecting pirates’ usernames and passwords through the use of malware really going to be admissible in court? I strongly doubt it.

> “”Test.exe” is part of the DRM and is only targeted against specific pirate copies of copyrighted software obtained illegally.”

**I do not care** who it is targeted against. The file is on **MY** system before I even enter my serial key. The simple act of malware being there is not okay.
How do we know that none of the FSLabs AOC services use the .exe and package it off elsewhere? Running the file in Fiddler showed that no network connections were made, which is nice. At this moment in time I’m unable to test if any malicious connections occur with the FSLabs software but at this stage with it claimed to being an anti piracy measure, I doubt it is.

> “This method has already successfully provided information that we’re going to use in our ongoing legal battles against such criminals.”

Really? I hope whoever it is has a good lawyer. Fighting fire with fire is not necessarily the best way to go about it, jeopardising the integrity of your own company and paying customers’ support, but I can see how there is the anger there to pursue pirates.

> “We will be happy to provide further information to ensure that no customer feels threatened by our security measures — we assure you that there is nothing in our products that would ever damage the trust you have placed in our company by being our customer.”

I would urge FSLabs’ to take a look at the test.exe file, and ask themselves, is this okay to put onto the systems of all our customers? The placement of malware whilst asking them to turn off their anti virus software, and hope they believe we’re legitimate? I believe any self respecting developer would agree with me that this act is vehemently unacceptable. All I ask is for FSLabs to rethink their anti piracy strategy, and remove the step of malware being placed onto customers’ systems. Nothing more, nothing less. Do I expect FSLabs to listen? No, but I hope this gives people an insight into the issues surrounding this, and accepting malware on your computer just because somebody says ‘Trust me’ is not okay.

## UPDATE 19/02/2018 1200z

The [latest announcement](https://forums.flightsimlabs.com/index.php?%2Ftopic%2F16225-drm-issues%2F=) states that a new installer has been released without the test.exe file. I am not sure what other action could have been taken by FSLabs, so this is good news. I do enjoy their products, and I am satisfied by this response, but it is important to note that this method of tackling with piracy is not the correct way to do it. As long as this lesson has been learned, then I have nothing more to add and will continue to use FSLabs’ products, on the basis that this kind of behaviour is never done again. Some people would argue that they will never use FSLabs again and have lost trust as a result of this scenario.

## UPDATE 19/02/2018 2100z

[Fidus InfoSec](https://www.fidusinfosec.com/fslabs-flight-simulation-labs-dropping-malware-to-combat-piracy/) were able to conduct a technical analysis and revealed that a 55MB .bin file is used during the installation. A ‘strings’ search reveals that if a fraudulent/illegal serial key is used:

* test.exe is invoked
* The output (usernames and passwords) is dumped to a file called log.txt
* The additional base64.exe in the tmp directory encodes the log.txt file
* The encoded data is sent using HTTP to a LogHandler3.ashx endpoint

If a legitimate key is used:

* test.exe is NOT invoked
* Your usernames and passwords are not retrieved or processed by FSLabs

![]()

Legitimate serial flow. Photo credit to Fidus InfoSec

Now obviously there are legal issues with the placement of the file on customers’ systems, and the acquisition of pirates’ usernames and passwords, however the primary concern of what the application does and how it is used has been addressed and resolved at this stage.

## UPDATE 19/02/2018 2211z

An actual [thought out response has been provided by FSLabs](https://forums.flightsimlabs.com/index.php?%2Fannouncement%2F11-a320-x-drm-what-happened%2F=), explaining exactly how they used the tool and who it was executed against. This article was mostly written on a whim to express my thoughts, and somehow blew up.
