Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7290:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization or encoding when handling external links in Tiki's wiki pages. Specifically, the issue is in `lib/parser/parserlib.php`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a stored XSS. This means an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which is then stored within the Tiki application and executed when a victim views the affected content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An authenticated user can inject JavaScript, and if an administrator views a page containing the injected code, the attacker can potentially gain administrative privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Modified External Links:** The attacker injects the malicious JavaScript into an external link within a wiki page.
- **Mouse Over Trigger:** The XSS payload is triggered when an administrator hovers their mouse cursor over the crafted external link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a valid user of the Tiki application.
- **Content Creation/Editing:** The attacker must have the ability to create or edit wiki pages to insert the malicious link.
- **Victim Action:** An administrator must view the crafted wiki page and move their mouse pointer over the malicious link to trigger the exploit.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in Tiki 18.1 and backported to versions 12.13, 15.6, and 17.2.
- The fix is available on SourceForge.
