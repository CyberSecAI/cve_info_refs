Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7713:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the `validateInputImageSize` function in `modules/imgcodecs/src/loadsave.cpp` of OpenCV version 3.4.1. This function performs checks on the size of the input image before processing it. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered when the image's width exceeds a certain limit: `(size.width <= (1<<20))` evaluates to false.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The `validateInputImageSize` function fails to adequately handle cases where image dimensions are exceptionally large, specifically the width.
- **Assertion Failure:** When the width of the image exceeds the threshold (`1<<20` or 1048576), the code throws a `cv::Exception`, which leads to program termination, thus creating a denial-of-service vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by providing an image with an exceedingly large width, causing the application using the vulnerable OpenCV library to terminate abruptly.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a specially crafted image to a system using the vulnerable OpenCV library.
- **Malicious Image:** The primary attack vector is through a malicious image file that has a width dimension exceeding the allowed limit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send or make the specially crafted image accessible to the vulnerable application.
- **No Privileges Required:** Exploiting this vulnerability does not require any special privileges on the target system.
- **No User Interaction:** The vulnerability can be triggered without any user interaction beyond loading the malicious image.

**Additional Technical Details from the provided content**

- The `CV_Assert` used in OpenCV is a regular C++ exception, not a simple C-like assert, which can cause a crash if not handled appropriately.
- The vulnerability is located in the `imread` function which calls the `validateInputImageSize`.
- The provided proof of concepts (dos-1, dos-2, and dos-3) demonstrates three different size-related assertion failures, however, CVE-2018-7713 relates specifically to the width check, i.e. `dos-2` which triggers the condition `size.width <= (1<<20)`.
- The provided gdb backtrace shows the exact flow of the crash, starting from the `validateInputImageSize` function, going through the `cv::error` function and culminating in the `terminate()` call.
- The CVSS score is 7.5/10, indicating a high severity.
- The issue was reported on March 6, 2018 in the OpenCV github repo.

The provided information gives a clearer picture of the vulnerability than the generic CVE description, including the vulnerable code location and the nature of the assertion failure.
