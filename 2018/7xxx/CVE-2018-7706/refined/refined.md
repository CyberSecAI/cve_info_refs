Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7706:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of CVE-2018-7706 is the lack of path traversal checks within the SecurEnvoy SecurMail application. The application uses encrypted files as its primary data storage method and fails to sanitize user-supplied input, specifically in URL parameters, allowing for the manipulation of file paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The application does not validate or sanitize user-supplied paths, allowing an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A legitimate user can exploit the vulnerability to access and read the plaintext content of emails sent to other recipients. This is achieved by manipulating the file paths used to retrieve email bodies.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `option2` parameter within the `/secmail/getmessage.exe` endpoint to include path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`).
*   **Direct Access to `/secmail/getmessage.exe`:** The attacker crafts a specific URL with the vulnerable parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Legitimate User:** The attacker needs to be a legitimate recipient or have a valid `mailboxid`.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the SecurEnvoy server.
*   **Knowledge of Message IDs:** While not strictly required for exploitation, knowledge of message IDs allows the attacker to target specific emails. IDs are assigned sequentially, making them easily guessable.

**Technical Details:**

The advisory provides a specific example of the path traversal vulnerability:

```
http://<host>/secmail/getmessage.exe?mailboxid=<mailbox-id>&action=attachment&option1=103&option2=../107/BODY
```

In this example, the attacker attempts to access the body of email with ID 107 (`../107/BODY`) while only being authorized to access email with ID 103.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability is part of a group of vulnerabilities discovered in SecurEnvoy SecurMail 9.1.501.
*   The vulnerability can be mitigated by applying the "1_012018" hotfix patch or upgrading to version 9.2.501.
*   The vulnerability highlights the importance of input sanitization and proper authorization checks to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
