Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-7669

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the "Log Viewer" application of Sitecore CMS, specifically in how it handles the 'file' parameter in the URL. The application attempts to validate that the provided file path corresponds to the correct log file directory, but this validation can be bypassed by using directory traversal techniques.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Directory Traversal:** The primary weakness is the ability to traverse directories outside of the intended log file directory. The application does not sufficiently sanitize or validate the input provided to the 'file' parameter, allowing "../" sequences to escape the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary File Access:** Attackers can read arbitrary files from the host operating system. This includes sensitive files like configuration files (e.g., `ConnectionStrings.config` which contains database login credentials) and system files (e.g., `win.ini`).
*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to potentially confidential data residing on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is through crafted HTTP GET requests to the `sitecore/shell/default.aspx` endpoint using the `xmlcontrol=LogViewerDetails` and a manipulated `file` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Sitecore CMS instance.
*   **Authentication:** The provided content specifies that authentication is required to access the vulnerable endpoint. However, it does not clarify whether this is a standard user account or specific administrative privileges.

**Technical Details:**
* The vulnerability is triggered by providing a valid log file name followed by directory traversal sequences like `..\..\..\..\..\` in the 'file' parameter.
* Example vulnerable URLs provided:
    * Reading the `win.ini` file:
      `http://<website>/sitecore/shell/default.aspx?xmlcontrol=LogViewerDetails&file=c%3a%5cwebsites%5c<website>%5cdata%5clogs%5<valid log file>.txt\..\..\..\..\..\windows\win.ini`
    * Reading the `ConnectionStrings.config` file:
      `http://<website>/sitecore/shell/default.aspx?xmlcontrol=LogViewerDetails&file=c%3a%5cwebsites%5c<website>%5cdata%5clogs%5c<valid log file>.txt\..\..\..\Website\App_Config\ConnectionStrings.config`

**Affected Versions:**
*   Sitecore CMS 8.1 rev. 151207 Hotfix 141178-1 and above. Earlier versions are untested

**Additional Information**
*   The vendor acknowledged the vulnerability and stated a fix was in progress
