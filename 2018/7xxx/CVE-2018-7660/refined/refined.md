- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of user-controlled input in error pages. Specifically, the `_docbase` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied data before including it in the HTML output, leading to the possibility of injecting arbitrary scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser within the context of the vulnerable web application. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the web page
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Stealing of sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL with JavaScript code embedded in the vulnerable parameters, and tricking a user into clicking the link. 
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and must induce the victim to access that URL.
