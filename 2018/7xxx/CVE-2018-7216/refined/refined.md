Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The Bravo Tejari Web Portal's web interface lacks protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. Specifically, it does not use random tokens to validate requests, allowing an attacker to forge requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **CSRF vulnerability:** The application does not implement CSRF protection mechanisms, making it susceptible to forged requests.
*   **Lack of random tokens:** The absence of random tokens in HTTP requests allows attackers to craft malicious requests that appear legitimate.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Account Modification:** An attacker can modify user account details, including name, company address, and email address.
*   **Business Impact:** As the application is a procurement portal, changes to contact details can affect business communications and contract lifecycles, potentially causing significant business disruption for victims.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers trick users into clicking a malicious link.
*   **Forged HTTP Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request using a form, often disguised and sent to the victim.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local - Authenticated:** The attacker needs to be aware of the target portal and have some knowledge of its users.  They also need the ability to create and send a crafted HTTP request. The attack is local in the sense that it requires the user to be logged into the vulnerable portal, however the attacker does not need to be on the same network.
*   **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to trick users into clicking malicious links.

**Additional Details:**
*   The provided proof-of-concept code shows how to forge a request to modify user profile data on a specific endpoint (`/esop/toolkit/profile/regData.do`).
*   The vulnerability was discovered on 12th December 2017 and disclosed on 15th February 2018, after two attempts to contact the vendor were unsuccessful.
*   The advisory mentions that all sensitive CRUD operations must be protected with random tokens or an additional authentication layer.
