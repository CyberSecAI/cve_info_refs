Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the CVE-2018-7600 vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The core issue lies in Drupal's acceptance of request parameters as array objects without proper sanitization. Specifically, a malicious user can craft a request with an array object where a key contains a payload, which Drupal will then process and execute.
- The vulnerability exists in the way Drupal handles request parameters, allowing attackers to inject malicious code through various form elements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary code remotely on the server.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** Drupal fails to properly sanitize array objects in request parameters, allowing for the injection of malicious payloads.
- **Vulnerable Form API (FAPI) AJAX Requests:** The Form API's AJAX requests are susceptible due to insufficient sanitation of user-supplied data.
- Improper handling of renderable arrays and their metadata.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation enables the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise.
- **Full Site Takeover:** Attackers can potentially gain control of the entire Drupal site.
- **Compromise of Application and OS:** Exploitation may result in the compromise of both the Drupal application and the underlying operating system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability can be exploited via a single HTTP request.
- **Drupal AJAX API:** The attack leverages Drupalâ€™s AJAX API by injecting a malicious payload into a form structure.
- **Form Elements:** Specifically, the `account/mail` element in the user registration form, `timezone/timezone`, and the `name` parameter in `user/password` form are identified as vectors.
- **URL Parameters:** Attackers manipulate URL parameters (e.g., `element_parents`, `ajax_form`) to trigger vulnerable code paths.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.
- **Network Access:** Attackers need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Drupal instance.
- **No Special Privileges:** Attackers do not require special privilege levels.

**Additional Technical Details:**

- Drupal core accepts request parameters as array objects, enabling malicious users to pass an array object with a key containing a payload, which Drupal will process without sanitization.
-  The vulnerability affects Drupal versions 6, 7, and 8.
-  Patches have been released for versions 7.x, 8.3.x, 8.4.x, and 8.5.x.
-  Drupal 7.x requires an extra value from a form (`form_build_id`).
- Exploit methods differ slightly between Drupal 7.x and Drupal 8.x
-  Some exploits utilize functions like `exec` or `passthru` to execute commands.
-  Exploits may involve writing a PHP web shell to the web root to facilitate command execution.
- The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting specific requests to vulnerable endpoints, such as `user/register` or `user/password` using  `#post_render`, `#lazy_builder` parameters.
-  Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing attackers to compromise the Drupal application and potentially the underlying operating system.
- The vulnerability can be exploited through `user/register?element_parents=account/mail/%23value&ajax_form=1&_wrapper_format=drupal_ajax` for Drupal 8 and `user/password&name[%23post_render][]=passthru&name[%23type]=markup&name[%23markup]=` and then `/file/ajax/name/%23value/{form_build_id}` for Drupal 7.
- Successful exploits can lead to the potential compromise of the web application and underlying operating system.
- The exploit involves injecting malicious renderable arrays via form fields like email addresses.
-  Drupal 7 needs two requests in order to exploit.
