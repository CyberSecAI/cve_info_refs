Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Gleez CMS allows users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the source editor in blog posts. This unsanitized input is then stored and executed when an administrator attempts to edit the post, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists because the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input (HTML content).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of an administrator's session when they edit a blog post containing the malicious code.
- This can lead to hijacking the administrator's session/token.
- It can also be used to perform actions against the administrators and potentially lead to full control of the application.

**Attack vectors:**
1. A user with the ability to create blog posts logs into the Gleez CMS.
2. They add a new blog post and switch the content editor to HTML mode.
3. They inject malicious JavaScript/HTML code, such as `<img src="x" onerror="alert(document.domain)" style="">` into the content.
4. They save the blog post, storing the malicious code in the application.
5. When an administrator or another user with editing rights edits the same post, the malicious JavaScript/HTML code will execute in the administrator's browser and context.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a user account with permission to create blog posts.
- The attacker needs to be able to access and manipulate the HTML source of a blog post.
- The administrator must view or edit the blog post after the attacker has created it to trigger the XSS.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Gleez CMS versions 1.2.0 and 2.0.0.
- The vulnerability is triggered on edit, not on the normal view of the post.
- The vulnerability is assigned CVE-2018-7035.
- CVSS v3 base score of 5.4 is assigned with metrics: AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
