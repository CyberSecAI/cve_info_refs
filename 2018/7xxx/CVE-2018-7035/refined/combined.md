## Description

[![@y-mehta](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24428063?u=4cf49238836fe3c4544182aceb522312d2d90af0&v=4&size=48)](/y-mehta)[y-mehta](https://github.com/y-mehta)opened [on Feb 16, 2018](https://github.com/gleez/cms/issues/794#issue-297695147)

**Description:**

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Gleez CMS might allow remote attackers (users) to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the source editor, which will result in Stored XSS when an Administrator tries to edit the post.

**Vulnerability Type:** Stored XSS

**Attack Vectors:**

1. Login as user on Gleez CMS
2. Click on Blogs -> Add Blog
3. Change to HTML mode in content box.
4. Add XSS Payload : `<img src="x" onerror="alert(document.domain)" style="">`
5. Save the blog.
6. Login as Administrator
7. Goto Blogs
8. Open the malicious blog and click on edit.
9. XSS!

**Attack Impact:**

This could be used to perform actions against the administrators (or any user editing that post) and could potentially lead to hijacking the user‚Äôs session/token. This could happen by users navigating to the attacker‚Äôs post on their own, or by the attacker somehow persuading the victim to navigate to the post.

Note: It'll not result into XSS in the normal view mode, but when admin or other user will try to edit the post code will be executed.[Stored XSS from User to Admin.]

Assigned CVE: [CVE-2018-7035](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m2r2-qc49-gqw4 "CVE-2018-7035")

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
