**Web Services and API
Penetration Testing Part #2**

Welcome readers to Part 2 of Web Services Penetration
Testing.
In this part, we will take a quick look into the various
test cases, tools and method for security testing of Web Services.
Black box Web Services Penetration Testing pre-requisite:
è
Web Service Description Language (WSDL) file
Grey box Web Services Penetration Testing pre-requisite:
è
Sample requests/responses for methods along with
WSDL file.
**Stages of Penetration
Testing of Web Service:**
1.
Information Gathering
2.
Black Box
3.
Google hacking (using dorks to discover web
services for websites hosted over network)
4.
UDDI
5.
Web Service Discovery (If no WSDL provided)
6.
Authentication Type Discovery
**Testing Methodology:**
è
Automated Testing Tools
·
SoapUI Pro
·
OWASP ZAP
·
IBM AppScan
·
HP Webinspect
·
WSBang
·
WSMap

è
Manual Testing Tools
·
Soap UI Free
·
Burp Suite Pro
·
Postman ( with burp)
è
Extensions:
·
SAML Editor
·
SAML Encoder / Decoder
·
WSDL Wizard
·
Wsdler
·
SOA Client
Test cases to find in web services:
·
Fuzzing
·
XSS /SQLi/ Malformed XML
·
File Upload
·
Xpath Injection
·
XML Bomb (DoS)
·
Authentication based attacks
·
Replay attacks
·
Session fixation
·
XML Signature wrapping
·
Session timeout
·
Host Cipher Support/ Valid Certificate/ Protocol
Support
·
Hashing Algorithm Support
Let’s now take a look on how to perform a automated scan
using SOAP UI and get a preliminary first hand security report of the web
services.
**Using SOAP UI Pro for
security assessments:**
1.
Fire up SOAP UI and create a functional testcase

6.
Post the security scan, you can dig deeper into
the output or generate reports also for your assessment.

Practice VMS for vulnerable web services:
Virtual Machines
•
OWASP Mutillidae
•
PenTester Lab: Axis2 Web Service and Tomcat
Manager
•
DVWS
•
OWASP WebGoat

Part 3 of this series will focus on using burp suite+
postman along with SOAP UI for manual testing of web services. Stay hooked.

HTML Injection- October CMS

By- Samrat Das

Hi Readers,

Recently while performing some open source security
assessment, I came across an CMS Application, “October CMS” . Curious to
explore its functionalities, I set up a local copy and started playing around
to find security vulnerabilities’.

**Title of the Vulnerability**:
HTML Injection.

**Vulnerability Class**: Code Execution/ Information Stealing

**Technical Details & Description**: The application source
code is coded in a way which allows malicious HTML commands to be executed in the
inner pages which can lead to execution of arbitrary code.

**CVE ID allocated**: -  CVE-2018-7198

**Product & Service Introduction**: October CMS

**Steps to Re-Produce –**
1.       Visit the
application
2.       Visit the Add
Posts Page.
3.        Goto edit function and add any html payload,
it gets saved and executed further in web page.

**Exploitation Technique**: A attacker can perform application defacing
to information stealing.

**Severity Level**: High

**Security Risk:**
The presence of such a risk can lead to user data compromise
as well as site defacing.

**Exploit code:**
<input type=text>

**Affected Product Version**: October CMS

**Solution - Fix & Patch**: The application code should be
configured to encode input characters and prevent unsafe input.

By- Samrat Das Hi Readers Recently in one of my pentest research, I found a CMS " WonderCMS" hosted in github. Curious to explore its functionalities, I downloaded and set it up in my local system. After fiddling with the source code, I found that it did not have any kind of file upload security mechanism and allowed the user to upload any file type! After reporting it to them, I did not receive any security relevant response, hence decided to publish a blog on this. Title of the Vulnerability:   Arbitrary File Upload Vulnerability Class: Security Misconfiguration Technical Details & Description: The application source code is coded in a way which allows arbitrary file extensions to be uploaded. This leads to uploading of remote shells/ malicious Trojans which can lead to complete system compromise and server takeover.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
