Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-7198

**Vulnerability:** HTML Injection

**Root Cause:** The October CMS application's source code allows the execution of malicious HTML commands in inner pages due to a lack of input validation and sanitization. User-supplied HTML input is stored and rendered without proper encoding or filtering.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Insufficient input validation.
- Lack of output encoding/sanitization.
- Allows execution of arbitrary HTML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Application defacement.
- Information stealing.
- Potential for more complex attacks like stored XSS if the injected HTML includes JavaScript.
- User data compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to access the CMS's post editing functionality.
- The attacker can inject malicious HTML payload in the "Add Posts" page through the edit function.
- The injected HTML is then stored by the application, and displayed on the rendered web page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Must have access to the CMS's content editing/posting functionality.
- No specific user privilege level is mentioned beyond the ability to edit content, implying that a lower privileged user could potentially trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- The exploit code provided is a basic HTML input tag: `<input type=text>`. This shows the vulnerability by demonstrating that arbitrary HTML can be injected.
- The vulnerability is present in all October CMS versions prior to 1.0.431.
- The recommended solution is to implement proper input validation and encoding/sanitization to prevent the injection of unsafe HTML.

This information aligns with the official CVE description for CVE-2018-7198 which is HTML Injection, and the provided content elaborates on the technical details and implications of the vulnerability.
