Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7575:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing check on a block size value read from a meta checkpoint file. This block size, an `int64`, can be maliciously set to a very large value.
- When this large `int64` value is used in an addition operation, it causes an integer overflow.
- The result of this overflow is then used as an index for a memory access operation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Integer Overflow: The primary vulnerability is the integer overflow during the addition of the block size.
- Out-of-Bounds Read: The overflow leads to an out-of-bounds memory access when the result is used as an index.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit allows an attacker to cause the TensorFlow process to read from an arbitrary memory location that is outside of the intended bounds.
- This out-of-bounds read could potentially leak sensitive information from the TensorFlow process memory, or potentially lead to further issues depending on how that memory is used by the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a maliciously crafted meta checkpoint file.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to provide the crafted meta checkpoint to the vulnerable TensorFlow application. This could be through a file download from the internet, or other means of data import.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to create a malicious meta checkpoint file with an appropriately large block size to trigger the overflow.
- The attacker needs to be in a position to provide the malicious file to a vulnerable TensorFlow process either directly or indirectly.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided documents state that TensorFlow versions 1.0.0 up to 1.7.0 are affected.
- The vulnerability was fixed in commit `d107fee1` and addressed in TensorFlow version 1.7.1.
- The vulnerability was discovered by the Blade Team of Tencent.
