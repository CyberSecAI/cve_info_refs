Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-7809:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an "Unverified Password Change vulnerability" within the embedded web server of affected Schneider Electric Modicon PLCs. Specifically, it's the lack of authentication or verification when deleting the existing username and password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated Password Reset:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can delete the existing username and password of the HTTP server.
*   **Direct Impact:** This action resets the web server's username and password to the default "USER/USER".

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** By resetting the credentials to default, an attacker gains unauthorized access to the web server.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Once access is obtained, the attacker can potentially manipulate the PLC, causing disruption or damage to the controlled industrial processes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network using HTTP requests.
*   **Specific URL:** Attackers can trigger the vulnerability by sending an HTTP GET request to the following URL: `http://[ip]/unsecure/embedded/builtin?submit=Delete%20Password`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the PLC's web server, i.e., have network access to the device.
*   **No Authentication:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or valid credentials to exploit this vulnerability

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects all Modicon M340, Premium, Quantum PLCs, and the BMXNOR0200 module.
*   The advisory states that no patches are available and instead recommends mitigation strategies involving access controls and firewalls.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8, indicating a "Critical" severity rating.
