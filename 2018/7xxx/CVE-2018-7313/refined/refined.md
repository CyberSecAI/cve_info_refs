Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-7313:

**CVE-2018-7313**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by an SQL injection flaw in the `searchtext` parameter of the Joomla! Component CW Tags.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:**  The component fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `searchtext` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
    *   Retrieve sensitive information from the database, potentially including usernames, passwords, and other confidential data.
    *   Modify or delete data in the database.
    *  Potentially gain unauthorized access to the system, depending on the database user's permissions.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable component. The `searchtext[]` parameter is used to inject SQL code.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target Joomla! site.
    *   No specific user authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability, making it accessible to unauthenticated attackers.
*   **Specific Technical Details:**
    * The vulnerable parameter is `searchtext[]` within the `com_cwtags` component.
    * The exploit examples provided utilize techniques such as `UNION` and comments (`--`) to bypass the original query and execute malicious SQL.
    * The exploit example shows how to extract the database name using SQL injection.
*   **Affected Component:** Joomla! Component CW Tags version 2.0.6
*  **Additional Notes:** The exploit information includes example payloads to extract the database name. The provided content contains references to the vendor's website and the Joomla Extensions Directory.
