Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-7543:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue due to the direct injection of the `$_POST` variable 'json' in the file `duplicator/installer/build/view.step4.php` at line 254.
*   **Weakness:** The code fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input (specifically the 'json' parameter), allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable script, with the 'json' parameter containing malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to trick a user into visiting a crafted link or browsing to a URL under the attacker's control. The attacker also needs to understand the structure of the vulnerable POST request in order to construct it.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability is located in the `duplicator/installer/build/view.step4.php` file.
*   The vulnerable code directly uses the `$_POST['json']` variable without sanitization.
*   The injected JavaScript is executed within the `<script>` tag, which is part of the application's response.
*   The provided Proof of Concept demonstrates how to inject a JavaScript alert using the `document.cookie` property.

**Affected Software:**

*   **Product:** WordPress Duplicator Plugin
*   **Version:** 1.2.32 (and possibly earlier versions)

**Mitigation:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.33. Users of affected versions should upgrade to this version or later.
