Package        : vips
Version        : 7.28.5-1+deb7u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-7998
Debian Bug     : #892589

It was discovered that there was NULL function pointer dereference
vulnerability in vips, an image processing system for very large images.

Remote attackers could cause a denial of service via a specially-crafted
image file which  occurred due to a race condition involving a failed
image load and other worker threads.

For Debian 7 "Wheezy", this issue has been fixed in vips version
7.28.5-1+deb7u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your vips packages.

Regards,

If a delayed load failed, it could leave the pipeline only half-set up.
Sebsequent threads could then segv.

Set a load-has-failed flag and test before generate.

See <https://github.com/jcupitt/libvips/issues/893>
