Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7998:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a race condition that occurs during the loading of images with a delayed load mechanism. If an initial attempt to load an image fails, it can leave the pipeline in a partially initialized state. Subsequent worker threads might then attempt to access the uninitialized or invalid data, leading to a crash due to a NULL function pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Race Condition:** Multiple threads can access and modify the state of an image load operation concurrently.
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:**  A failed initial load can result in subsequent threads trying to use a NULL function pointer which leads to a crash.
- **Insufficient Error Handling:** The system did not properly handle the case where the initial image load fails, leading to a corrupted state.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A remote attacker can cause the application to crash by providing a specially crafted image file that triggers the vulnerability. This can interrupt the applicationâ€™s services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially-crafted Image File:** The attack is triggered by providing a malicious image file that causes the initial image loading to fail and thus a race condition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to submit a malicious image file to the vulnerable application. This could be through a web service, file upload functionality, or other data ingestion mechanisms.
- **No Special Privileges Required**: The vulnerability is triggered by the application's normal image processing routines when processing a crafted image, so no special privileges are required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves adding a flag (`load->error`) to indicate when a load has failed. Before a thread attempts to generate an output it checks if the flag is set and if it is set the thread will not generate an output.
- The commit message `fix a crash with delayed load` and the associated issue `#893` on the github repository confirm the vulnerability.
- The fix is specifically implemented in `vips_foreign_load_start` function.
