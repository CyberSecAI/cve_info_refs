Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7812:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a discrepancy in the embedded web servers of certain Schneider Electric Modicon PLCs. Specifically, the web server responds differently depending on the success or failure of an operation. This inconsistent behavior exposes security-relevant information, such as the outcome of an action.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Exposure:** The core vulnerability is information disclosure through inconsistent responses from the web server. This allows an attacker to infer the internal state of the PLC, based on the server's response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can use this vulnerability to potentially gather sensitive information about the PLC. This could include knowledge of the PLCâ€™s state, potentially facilitating further attacks or manipulation of the system. The provided exploit code is designed to discover this information and potentially automate attacks.
* The vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access and control over the PLC system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** The vulnerability is exposed through the embedded web server, meaning it is remotely exploitable over a network.
*   **Shodan Integration:** The provided Proof of Concept (POC) integrates with Shodan, a search engine for internet-connected devices, to find potentially vulnerable PLC systems exposed on the internet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable PLC's web server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs awareness of the vulnerability (CVE-2018-7812) and how to exploit it. The provided POC code provides this capability.
* **Automated Exploitation:** The included Python script, "exploit.py" automates the process of finding vulnerable servers and testing the exploit.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:** The vulnerability affects Modicon M340, Premium, Quantum PLCs, and BMXNOR0200.
*   **Affected Versions:** The POC was tested on specific versions of Schneider-WEB servers, including V2.1.3, V2.2.0, V2.0.11, V2.2.1, V2.5.0, and V1.0.4 (port 83).
*   **Public Exposure:** As of December 19, 2018, there were approximately 300 systems with these characteristics exposed on the internet, based on Shodan results.
*   **Timeline:**
    *   Vendor Notified: 2018-03-28
    *   Vendor Disclosed: 2018-12-17
    *   POC Released: 2018-12-19
