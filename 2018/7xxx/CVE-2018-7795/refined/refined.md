Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the improper neutralization of input during web page generation, specifically a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This occurs because the PowerLogic PM5560 product fails to properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages served by the device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - CWE-79:** The device is susceptible to reflected XSS attacks via its web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to manipulate user inputs, enabling remote code execution within the context of the user's browser. This could lead to a variety of malicious activities depending on the scope of the user's access and the attacker's goals.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is remote, leveraging the device's web interface.
*   The attacker would need to manipulate user input that is reflected in a webpage.
*  Successful exploitation requires user interaction (UI:R).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need special privileges on the system (PR:N).
*   The attacker needs a low skill level to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into the web interface, likely by crafting a malicious link or by manipulating a form field.

**Additional details:**

*   The affected product is Schneider Electric's PowerLogic PM5560 with firmware versions prior to 2.5.4.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2018-7795 and has a CVSS v3 base score of 8.2.
*   The vulnerability affects the energy sector.
*   The vulnerability was reported to NCCIC by Schneider Electric, working with researchers.
