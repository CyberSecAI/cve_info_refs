Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7418:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies within the SIGCOMP dissector of Wireshark. Specifically, a malformed packet could trigger the dissector to call `wmem_alloc` with a negative value as the size argument, leading to a crash. This is because the size parameter of `wmem_alloc` is interpreted as an unsigned value and a negative value is considered a huge positive value, causing an out of memory condition and crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Negative Memory Allocation:** The primary vulnerability is the potential to call `wmem_alloc` with a negative size, resulting in an attempted allocation of a huge amount of memory. This is due to the fact that the size parameter is interpreted as an unsigned value and a negative value is considered a huge positive value, causing an out of memory condition and crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Crash:** The main impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a crash of the Wireshark application.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By crashing Wireshark, an attacker can prevent it from being used to analyze network traffic.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Packet Injection:** An attacker can inject a crafted, malformed SIGCOMP packet onto the network.
- **Malicious Trace File:** An attacker could convince a user to open a malformed packet trace file containing the malicious SIGCOMP packet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access (for packet injection):** The attacker needs the ability to inject packets onto a network being monitored by Wireshark.
- **Social Engineering (for trace file):** Alternatively, the attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious trace file.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided bug report on gitlab and the Wireshark security advisory directly reference CVE-2018-7418.
*   The Debian security announcements confirm that this CVE was addressed in updated packages for both Debian 7 and 8.
*   The specific memory allocation function mentioned is `wmem_alloc`.

**Summary of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability in the SIGCOMP dissector allowed an attacker to cause a crash in Wireshark by sending a malformed SIGCOMP packet. This malformed packet would cause the `wmem_alloc` function to be called with a negative value, which resulted in allocation failure and program termination.
