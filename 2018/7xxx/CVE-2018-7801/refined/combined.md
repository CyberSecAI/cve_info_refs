## 4. MITIGATIONS

Schneider Electric recommends users setup a firewall to restrict remote access to the charging stations by unauthorized users. A software update is also available for download to mitigate these vulnerabilities:

[https://www.schneider-electric.com/en/download/range/60850-EVlink Parking/?docTypeGroup=3541958-Software/Firmware](https://www.schneider-electric.com/en/download/range/60850-EVlink%20Parking/?docTypeGroup=3541958-Software/Firmware)

For more information see Schneider Electric’s security notification which can be viewed at the following link:

<https://www.schneider-electric.com/en/download/document/SEVD-2018-354-01/>

Schneider Electric also recommends the following cybersecurity best practices:

* Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* Physical controls should be in place so that no unauthorized person would have access to the ICS and safety controllers, peripheral equipment or the ICS and safety networks.
* All controllers should reside in locked cabinets and never be left in the “Program” mode.
* All programming software should be kept in locked cabinets and should never be connected to any network other than the network for the devices that it is intended.
* All methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB drives, etc. should be scanned before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.
* Laptops that have connected to any other network besides the intended network should never be allowed to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.
* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS-CERT website](/ics/) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

            product: Multiple Schneider Electric EVlink Charging Stations
 vulnerable version: Firmware R7 (Version V3.3.0.15)
      fixed version: Firmware R8 (Version V3.4.0.1)

Source:<https://www.se.com/ww/en/about-us/>  <<https://www.se.com/ww/en/about-us/>>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor provides a firmware update for the affected charging stations which
should be installed immediately.

SEC Consult highly recommends to perform a thorough security review of the
Schneider Electric EVlink product line conducted by security professionals to
identify and resolve potential further security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Authentication Bypass with Undocumented Hard Coded Credentials (CVE-2021-22707)
The authentication for the EVlink administration web interface can be bypassed
with undocumented and hard coded HTTP cookie values. Initial analysis indicates
that this authentication method is intended for local authentication by the
"evse" service.

2) Lack of Secure Update Mechanism / Remote Code Execution (CVE-2021-22708)
An authenticated attacker can upload arbitrary, malicious firmware updates to
the device and thus gain remote code execution. The firmware integrity is
checked by generating a SHA256 hash of the firmware update contents and a hard
coded value and comparing it against a hash stored within the firmware update
(CONTROL file).

An attacker can create a malicious firmware update by modifying the firmware
contents and adjusting the hash in the CONTROL file.

Based on public information we believe this vulnerability type was once
reported as CVE-2018-7801 by Positive Technologies before.
The patch notes [1] indicate that a signature was introduced in R6 software
v3.2.0-12 as a fix. It is likely this fix did not actually fix the
vulnerability.

<<https://download.schneider-electric.com/files?p_enDocType=Software+-+Release+Notes&p_File_Name=Annotation_to_SEVD-2018-354-01_Security+Notification.pdf&p_Doc_Ref=annotation_SEVD-2018-354-01>>

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Authentication Bypass with Undocumented Hard Coded Credentials (CVE-2021-22707)
The web interface authentication can be bypassed by setting the following HTTP
cookie values:
- CURLTOKEN=b35fcdc1ea1221e6dd126e172a0131c5a
- SESSIONID=admin

With those cookies the attacker is logged in with admin permissions.

2) Lack of Secure Update Mechanism / Remote Code Execution (CVE-2021-22708)
The file "epk-install.sh" stored in /mnt/datas/opt/evse/epk-install.sh performs
the validation of the firmware update image.

Below is an excerpt:
===========================================================
[...]
cd $INSTALL_DIR
[...]

# extract files from archive (epz is an epk.gz, but tar xf will handle it)
tar xf "$file"

if [[ ! -f CONTROL ]]; then
abort "KO, missing signature"
fi

echo $private_key > private

find . -type f | grep -v CONTROL | xargs sha256sum | awk '{print $1}' | sort | sha256sum > ../CONTROL2
mv ../CONTROL2 .
rm private

if [[ "`diff CONTROL CONTROL2`" != "" ]]; then
cat CONTROL CONTROL2
abort "KO, signatures mismatch"
fi
[...]
===========================================================

The $private_key parameter is not a cryptographic signature. It is a hard coded
key found in the "cgiServer" and "evse" binary and not a cryptographic
signature.
The value is: 67acdb2bce676ac1b1766c99b07f37fa591ea5f39f57afc874bab704a0a36964

It is placed in the firmware directory during the computation of the SHA256
hash.

This script can be modified easily to provide a valid hash for the CONTROL
file.

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The vulnerabilities have been found in the firmware R7 (Version V3.3.0.15),
which is the latest version at the time of discovery.

Initial analysis indicates that at least the following Schneider Electric
products are affected:
- EVlink Charging Smart Wallbox
- EVlink Parking
- EVlink City ranges

Vendor contact timeline:
------------------------
2021-03-11 | Contacting vendor throughcybersecurity () schneider-electric com  <mailto:cybersecurity () schneider-electric
com>
2021-03-11 | Vendor response, vulnerabilities are under investigation.
2021-03-11 | Vendor response, vulnerabilities confirmed, fix and disclosure
             scheduled for July 2021.
2021-07-14 | Coordinated release of security advisory.

Solution:
---------
