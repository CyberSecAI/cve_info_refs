Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7801:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an improper control of code generation, specifically a **Code Injection** issue. This means that the application does not properly sanitize or validate input, which allows an attacker to inject and execute malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Code Injection (CWE-94):** The core weakness is the ability to inject arbitrary code into the system, which can lead to further exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system. This could lead to a complete compromise of the device.
*   **Maximum Privileges:** The injected code executes with maximum privileges, giving the attacker full control over the device. This can include stopping the device, preventing charging, or any other action that the device can perform.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable via network access to the device.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The attack requires user interaction, though the details of this interaction are not provided.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable device.
*   **Low Skill Level:**  Exploitation requires low skill level.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information indicates that this vulnerability was reported along with two other vulnerabilities, CVE-2018-7800 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) and CVE-2018-7802 (SQL Injection) within the Schneider Electric EVLink Parking charging stations.
*   The vulnerability was identified in EVLink Parking versions 3.2.0-12_v1 and prior.
*   A firmware update is available to address the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Vladimir Kononovich and Vyacheslav Moskvin of Positive Technologies.
* The SEC Consult advisory suggests that a previous attempt to fix this vulnerability may have been ineffective. They identified the issue is present in firmware R7 (Version V3.3.0.15) with an insecure update mechanism. The issue is that the device calculates a hash to verify firmware integrity using a hardcoded key. Thus, an attacker can modify the firmware and the hash, rendering the check useless.
