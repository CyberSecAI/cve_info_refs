Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2018-7542:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient checks within the Xen hypervisor when handling x86 PVH (Paravirtualized Hardware) guests that are configured without a Local APIC (Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller).
*   Multiple code paths within Xen incorrectly assume the presence of a Local APIC, leading to potential null pointer dereferences when it's absent.
*   Furthermore, the logic intended to disable hardware acceleration for these guests is flawed. This leaves the guest with control over the real Task Priority Register on Intel hardware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Null pointer dereference:**  Xen does not properly validate the presence of a Local APIC before attempting to use it, which can cause a crash.
*   **Incomplete hardware acceleration disabling:** The mechanism to turn off hardware acceleration for PVH guests without LAPICs is not fully implemented and allows the guest to manipulate the real Task Priority Register.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious or buggy PVH guest can cause a hypervisor crash, leading to a denial of service condition affecting the entire host system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious or buggy PVH guest:** The vulnerability can be triggered by code within a PVH guest.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local access:** The attacker needs to be able to control a PVH guest on the vulnerable hypervisor.
*   **PVH guest with no LAPIC:** The guest must be configured to run without a Local APIC. This is a specific configuration, and not the default in most cases.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Xen versions 4.8 and later on x86 architectures.
*   ARM systems are not vulnerable.
*   PV and HVM guests cannot exploit this vulnerability
*   The vulnerability can be avoided by running all PVH guests with "apic=1" in the guest configuration.
*   The issue was discovered by Ian Jackson of Citrix.
