Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-7507:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a **Heap-based buffer overflow**. This occurs when the application reads data from a file into a fixed-length heap buffer, but the data is larger than the buffer's capacity, leading to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122)**: The application fails to properly check the size of the data being read from a file before writing it into a heap-allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation could allow for **remote code execution** or cause the application to **crash**.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is **network-based (remote)**, as indicated by `AV:N` in the CVSS vector. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by providing a specially crafted file to the vulnerable software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low skill level to exploit.**
*   The attacker does not require any privileges on the target system (`PR:N`).
*   The attack requires user interaction (`UI:R`) meaning a user must open the malicious file.

**Additional Details:**

*   The affected product is **Delta Electronics WPLSoft versions 2.45.0 and prior.**
*   The vulnerability was reported by Axt working with Trend Microâ€™s Zero Day Initiative.
*   The CVSS v3 base score is **8.3**, with the vector string: `AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H`.
    *   `AV:N` (Attack Vector: Network)
    *   `AC:L` (Attack Complexity: Low)
    *   `PR:N` (Privileges Required: None)
    *   `UI:R` (User Interaction: Required)
    *   `S:U` (Scope: Unchanged)
    *   `C:L` (Confidentiality: Low)
    *   `I:H` (Integrity: High)
    *   `A:H` (Availability: High)
*   The vendor recommends updating to the latest version (WPLSoft V2.46.0).
*   Additional mitigations include minimizing network exposure, using firewalls, and using secure remote access methods like VPNs.
