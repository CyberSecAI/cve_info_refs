**Detail**

* CVE-2018-7185

  + Severity: Low
  + CVSS3 Base Score: 3.1
  + CVSS3 Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)
  + The protocol engine in ntp 4.2.6 before 4.2.8p11 allows a remote attackers to cause a denial of service (disruption) by continually sending a packet with a zero-origin timestamp and source IP address of the "other side" of an interleaved association causing the victim ntpd to reset its association.
* CVE-2018-7184

  + Severity: Low
  + CVSS3 Base Score: 3.1
  + CVSS3 Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)
  + ntpd in ntp 4.2.8p4 before 4.2.8p11 drops bad packets before updating the "received" timestamp, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (disruption) by sending a packet with a zero-origin timestamp causing the association to reset and setting the contents of the packet as the most recent timestamp. This issue is a result of an incomplete fix for CVE-2015-7704.
* CVE-2018-7170

  + Severity: Low
  + CVSS3 Base Score: 3.1
  + CVSS3 Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)
  + ntpd in ntp 4.2.x before 4.2.8p7 and 4.3.x before 4.3.92 allows authenticated users that know the private symmetric key to create arbitrarily-many ephemeral associations in order to win the clock selection of ntpd and modify a victim's clock via a Sybil attack. This issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-1549.
* CVE-2018-7183

  + Severity: Moderate
  + CVSS3 Base Score: 5.0
  + CVSS3 Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)
  + Buffer overflow in the decodearr function in ntpq in ntp 4.2.8p6 through 4.2.8p10 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by leveraging an ntpq query and sending a response with a crafted array.
* CVE-2018-7182

  + Severity: Moderate
  + CVSS3 Base Score: 5.3
  + CVSS3 Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)
  + The ctl\_getitem method in ntpd in ntp-4.2.8p6 before 4.2.8p11 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via a crafted mode 6 packet with a ntpd instance from 4.2.8p6 through 4.2.8p10.
* CVE-2016-1549

  + Severity: Moderate
  + CVSS3 Base Score: 5.3
  + CVSS3 Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N)
  + A malicious authenticated peer can create arbitrarily-many ephemeral associations in order to win the clock selection algorithm in ntpd in NTP 4.2.8p4 and earlier and NTPsec 3e160db8dc248a0bcb053b56a80167dc742d2b74 and a5fb34b9cc89b92a8fef2f459004865c93bb7f92 and modify a victim's clock.

#### Description

The fix for [NTP Bug 2952](https://www.ntp.org/support/securitynotice/ntpbug2952/) was incomplete, and while it fixed one problem it created another. Specifically, it drops bad packets before updating the âreceivedâ timestamp. This means a third-party can inject a packet with a zero-origin timestamp, meaning the sender wants to reset the association, and the transmit timestamp in this bogus packet will be saved as the most recent âreceivedâ timestamp. The real remote peer does not know this value and this will disrupt the association until the association resets.

---

#### Mitigation

* Implement [BCP-38](http://www.bcp38.info/index.php/Main_Page).
* Upgrade to [4.2.8p11 or later](https://downloads.nwtime.org/ntp/4.2.8/).
* Use authentication with peer mode.
* Have enough sources of time.
* Properly monitor your `ntpd` instances.
* If `ntpd` stops running, auto-restart it without `-g`.

This weakness was discovered by Miroslav Lichvar of Red Hat.

CVE Name: CVE-2018-7182, CVE-2018-7170, CVE-2018-7184, CVE-2018-7185,
CVE-2018-7183
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
The ntpd(8) daemon is an implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP)
used to synchronize the time of a computer system to a reference time
source.
II. Problem Description
The ctl\_getitem() function is used by ntpd(8) to process incoming "mode 6"
packets. A malicious "mode 6" packet can be sent to an ntpd instance, and
if the ntpd instance is from 4.2.8p6 through 4.2.8p10, ctl\_getitem() will
read past the end of its buffer. [CVE-2018-7182]
The ntpd(8) service can be vulnerable to Sybil attacks. If a system is
configured to use a trustedkey and if one is not using the feature introduced
in ntp-4.2.8p6 allowing an optional 4th field in the ntp.keys file to specify
which IPs can serve time, a malicious authenticated peer, i.e., one where the
attacker knows the private symmetric key, can create arbitrarily-many
ephemeral associations in order to win the clock selection of ntpd and modify
a victim's clock. [CVE-2018-7170]
The fix for NtpBug2952 was incomplete, and while it fixed one problem it
created another. Specifically, it drops bad packets before updating the
"received" timestamp. This means a third-party can inject a packet with
a zero-origin timestamp, meaning the sender wants to reset the association,
and the transmit timestamp in this bogus packet will be saved as the most
recent "received" timestamp. The real remote peer does not know this
value and this will disrupt the association until the association resets.
[CVE-2018-7184]
The NTP Protocol allows for both non-authenticated and authenticated
associations, in client/server, symmetric (peer), and several broadcast
modes. In addition to the basic NTP operational modes, symmetric mode and
broadcast servers can support an interleaved mode of operation. In
ntp-4.2.8p4, a bug was inadvertently introduced into the protocol engine that
allows a non-authenticated zero-origin (reset) packet to reset an
authenticated interleaved peer association. If an attacker can send a packet
with a zero-origin timestamp and the source IP address of the "other side" of
an interleaved association, the 'victim' ntpd will reset its association.
The attacker must continue sending these packets in order to maintain the
disruption of the association. [CVE-2018-7185]
The ntpq(8) utility is a monitoring and control program for ntpd. The
internal decodearr() function of ntpq(8) that is used to decode an array in
a response string when formatted data is being displayed. This is a problem
in affected versions of ntpq if a maliciously-altered ntpd returns an array
result that will trip this bug, or if a bad actor is able to read an ntpq(8)
request on its way to a remote ntpd server and forge and send a response
before the remote ntpd sends its response. It is potentially possible that
the malicious data could become injectable/executable code. [CVE-2017-7183]
III. Impact
Malicious remote attackers may be able to break time synchornization,
or cause the ntpq(8) utility to crash.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available, but systems not running ntpd(8) or ntpq(8) are
not affected. Network administrators are advised to implement BCP-38 which
helps to reduce risk associated with the attacks.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
The ntpd service has to be restarted after the update. A reboot is
recommended but not required.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
The ntpd service has to be restarted after the update. A reboot is
recommended but not required.
3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
[FreeBSD 11.1]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-18:02/ntp-11.1.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-18:02/ntp-11.1.patch.asc
# gpg --verify ntp-11.1.patch.asc

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=3453#c0)  Harlan Stenn    2018-01-26 04:25:16 UTC   [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=3453#c1)  Harlan Stenn    2018-01-26 04:28:37 UTC  ``` Miroslav writes:  When a peer using the interleaved mode receives a packet with non-zero timestamps, it does not update its state unless the origin timestamp matches the receive timestamp of the previous packet. This prevents the protocol from recovering when the peers are sending packets with incorrect origin timestamps as they will both wait for a response that the other peer cannot send.  An off-path attacker can exploit this issue to permanently break an unauthenticated interleaved symmetric association by sending each peer a spoofed packet with a zero origin timestamp and a random non-zero receive timestamp. Off-path attackers are expected to be able to disrupt the protocol with spoofed packets, but the protocol should recover when the attack stops.  An attacker could potentially exploit it to permanently break an authenticated association if there was an old authenticated packet with zero origin timestamp and non-zero receive timestamp which could be replayed to the peers.  It seems the issue was introduced in 4.2.8p4 and affected both basic and interleaved modes in slightly different ways. The basic mode was already fixed (in [bug #2952](show_bug.cgi?id=2952 "VERIFIED FIXED - Symmetric active/passive mode is broken")?). The following patch fixes the interleaved mode by updating the state even if the origin timestamp is incorrect:  diff -up ntp-4.2.8p10/ntpd/ntp_proto.c.orig ntp-4.2.8p10/ntpd/ntp_proto.c --- ntp-4.2.8p10/ntpd/ntp_proto.c.orig	2018-01-24 13:35:16.611488502 +0100 +++ ntp-4.2.8p10/ntpd/ntp_proto.c	2018-01-24 13:35:24.113505866 +0100 @@ -1774,7 +1774,6 @@ receive(  		peer->bogusorg++;  		peer->flags |= FLAG_XBOGUS;  		peer->flash |= TEST2;		/* bogus */ -		return; /* Bogus packet, we are done */  	}    	/**/ ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=3453#c2)  Harlan Stenn    2018-01-27 11:42:06 UTC  ``` Miroslav,  Danny added that "return" as part of the fix to validate packets before KoD processing.  I've asked him about this, because if this 'return' was added to prevent a problem, removing it to fix interleave mode resets will break something else. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=3453#c3)  Danny Mayer    2018-01-28 23:05:37 UTC  ``` The problem that I see here is that if this affects interleave mode then Test2 may be wrong. The comment before that code says if found, flip and resynchronize. Now we need to know where that happens because it's not here. It also requires a review of what a inteleaved packet looks like. The test itself may very well need to be changed.  Danny ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=3453#c4)  Harlan Stenn    2018-01-30 10:28:48 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=3453#c3)) > The problem that I see here is that if this affects interleave mode then Test2 > may be wrong.

Dave says it's reasonable to always stay in interleave mode if we get in to interleave mode, but in the past the intent was to flip back to basic mode if that's what the other side wants.  I'm still digging in to this. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=3453#c5)  Miroslav Lichvar    2018-02-01 15:04:25 UTC  ``` The XBOGUS flag seems to be necessary to prevent the transmit timestamp from the following packet to be matched with an incorrect packet. It basically resets the state.  (In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=3453#c2)) > I've asked him about this, because if this 'return' was added to prevent a > problem, removing it to fix interleave mode resets will break something else.  As I understand it, there were two return statements added to prevent a spoofed KoD packet changing the poll interval ([bug #2901](show_bug.cgi?id=2901 "RESOLVED FIXED - Clients that receive a KoD should validate the origin timestamp field.")). This broke both basic symmetric mode ([bug #2952](show_bug.cgi?id=2952 "VERIFIED FIXED - Symmetric active/passive mode is broken")) and interleaved symmetric mode (this bug). The original fix for [bug #2901](show_bug.cgi?id=2901 "RESOLVED FIXED - Clients that receive a KoD should validate the origin timestamp field.") was reworked later and there is now a separate check for origin timestamp specific to KoD packets. The return statement specific to the basic mode was removed, but not the one specific to the interleaved mode.  In any case, couple lines above this code is a "Check for valid nonzero timestamp fields", which doesn't return. I don't think it makes sense to allow updating the state from packets that have a zero origin timestamp, but not from packets that have a non-zero origin timestamp. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=3453#c6)  Harlan Stenn    2018-02-04 10:51:30 UTC  ``` Miroslav,  Thanks for the report and patch.  The fix for [bug #2952](show_bug.cgi?id=2952 "VERIFIED FIXED - Symmetric active/passive mode is broken") was committed at 20:26:17 on 11 Apr 2016, removing the 'return' at the end of the first "Basic mode checks" in the "else if (peer->flip == 0) block.  Your patch is STAGED for 4.2.8p11. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=3453#c7)  contacto    2018-03-14 17:10:04 UTC  ``` Hello,  <http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/NtpBug3453> says that the CVSS2: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N) anyhow I understand that the attack is a DoS, hence the CVSS2 should be (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P) or (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C).  CVSS3 is correct.  Cheers, ``` |  |
