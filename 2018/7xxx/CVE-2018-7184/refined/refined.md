{
  "CVE-2018-7184": {
    "root_cause": "The fix for NTP Bug 2952 was incomplete. It drops bad packets before updating the 'received' timestamp, which allows a third-party to inject a packet with a zero-origin timestamp.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incomplete fix for previous vulnerability",
      "Improper handling of zero-origin timestamps"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can cause a denial of service (disruption) by sending a packet with a zero-origin timestamp, causing the association to reset and setting the contents of the packet as the most recent timestamp, disrupting time synchronization.",
    "attack_vectors": "Sending a crafted NTP packet with a zero-origin timestamp.",
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "Remote attacker capable of sending crafted network packets. Requires the attacker to know the target's IP address."
