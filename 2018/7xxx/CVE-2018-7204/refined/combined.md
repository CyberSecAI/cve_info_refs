## FAQ

### Invalid backend configuration. Readable volumes not available.

Please check your file permission from your hosting panel. The permission must be 0755 for file/folder, this means the path you have set must be readable by php process. If you are using a vps(virtual private server) then you must ensure that the owner of your installation is PHP aka www-data. Another reason could be wrong root folder path/url. Inserting a correct root folder path/URL should fix the issue.

### I can not upload larger files then 2 MB

You can upload any size of file. Bit file manager plugin uploads files in chunks. So a very large file can be easily uploaded & downloaded.

### Can I preview .psd and document files?

Yes, documents like PSD, DOCX can be previewed via file manager preview.

### Can I change file permission like cPanel?

Yes, file/folder permission can be changed like cPanel and other hosting management interfaces. It is very easy. Just right click on the file and you will see a menu named \*\*Change Mode \*\*. Clicking will open a dialogue box, where you can update the file permission, just like cPanel.

### Is it possible to edit file using code editor

Yes, It is possible to edit writeable files in the wordpress directory using code editor. This plugin includes multiple code editing like “Ace Editor”, “CodeMirror” and Text Editor.
