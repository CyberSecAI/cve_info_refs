Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-7469:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the "Industry Type" function in the 'Manage Site' section of the PHP Scripts Mall Entrepreneur Job Portal Script 2.0.9.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to sanitize user input in the "Edit Category Name" field, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes within the browsers of other users who access the affected pages.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The injected script can be used to steal session cookies, potentially leading to account hijacking.
*   **Other Impacts:** This vulnerability could also enable attackers to perform malicious redirects, deface websites, insert hostile content, redirect users, and potentially hijack user browsers with malware.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The attack is performed through the web interface of the application.
*   **Admin Panel:** The initial injection occurs through the admin panel in the "Categories - Industry Type" section.
*   **Affected Pages:** The XSS payload is triggered on the admin panel and also on the normal user login page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Admin Access:**  The attacker needs to have access to the admin panel to inject the malicious code initially.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the application.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Product:** PHP Scripts Mall Entrepreneur Job Portal Script 2.0.9
*   **Vulnerable Component:** "Industry Type" function in 'Manage Site'.
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** p\_name (Edit Category Name field)
*   **Request Method:** POST
*   **Exploit Code:**  `<script>alert("document.cookie")</script>`
*   **Affected Pages:**
    *   Admin Login: `http://freelancewebdesignerchennai.com/demo/job-portal/admin/categories_industry.php`
    *   Admin Login - edit page for injection `http://freelancewebdesignerchennai.com/demo/job-portal/admin/categories_industry.php?action=edit&id=52`
    *   Normal User Login: `http://freelancewebdesignerchennai.com/demo/job-portal/`

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability allows for stored XSS, meaning the malicious code is saved within the application and triggered when users access the affected pages.
* The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates a simple `alert()` that shows the user's cookies, but more complex and malicious JavaScript could be injected.
