##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# CVE-2018-7300: Arbitrary File Upload / Remote Code Execution in HomeMatic CCU2

[Patrick Münch](https://twitter.com/atomiczero111), in 21 February 2018

# Background

HomeMatic is a home automation system consisting of various components for automating several parts of a building, including different sensors and actuators. The HomeMatic CCU2 is a central control unit, which is responsible for integrating these components with each other.

From the vendor’s website ([eQ-3](http://www.eq-3.de/produkte/homematic/zentralen-und-gateways.html)):

“The Homematic Central Control Unit CCU2 is responsible for numerous control, signalling and supervision functions across all areas of the Homematic system. The device includes a browser based user interface to the up the system. It can be controlled in the local network as well as via Internet. The Homematic software offers various configuration and application possibilities, so that there are no limits to creativity for installing your individual smart home.”

# Issue Description

While analyzing the implementation of the CCU2’s web interface, one Directory Traversal vulnerabilities has been identified, which can be exploited in order to write arbitrary files to the CCU2’s filesystem. This vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers with access to the web interface.

The system provides a JSON API, which exposes various methods. While some methods require the connecting user to be authenticated, a number of methods can also be used anonymously.

A code review of the file `api/methods/user/setlanguage.tcl` revealed that the User.setLanguage method, which can be used without authentication, is prone to a Directory Traversal vulnerability. Please consider the following excerpt from the affected code:

```
exec echo $args(userLang)>/etc/config/userprofiles/$args(userName).lang

```

This means that an attacker can create or overwrite arbitrary files on the CCU2’s filesystem. Please note that full control over the target file name can be obtained by injecting a null byte into the userName argument in order to prevent the string “.lang” from being appended to the resulting file name. The file contents can be directly controlled via the userLang argument.

# Welcome

Todayâs world is heavily influenced by IT systems. Computers and software make our life easier, provide us with real-time communication all around the world, automate our production processes, manage our money. More and more companies and individuals rely on IT systems for their daily business, which implies that reliability and security of IT infrastructure becomes an increasingly important factor.

We support our clients in analyzing and evaluating their IT security risks by conducting design and/or code reviews in source and binary, by performing penetration tests and by providing individual solutions for custom IT security problems. We offer a broad spectrum of [services](services.html) - ranging from code reviews over penetration testing to our dedicated security services for agile software development.

Another element of our work is research. This includes both, theoretical and practical aspects in offense and defense: from improving the security of next-generation IT systems to building better reverse-engineering tools. If you are interested or would like to contribute, please feel free to contact us. Whatever the research outcome is - be it a conference talk, a paper or a tool - we believe that giving back something to the community is a good thing.
