{
  "CVE-2018-7253": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `ParseDsdiffHeaderConfig` function in `cli/dsdiff.c` of WavPack 5.1.0 doesn't properly handle certain DSDIFF files, leading to a heap-based buffer over-read.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Heap-based buffer over-read"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a denial-of-service or potentially overwrite the heap, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a maliciously crafted DSDIFF file to the vulnerable application.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted DSDIFF file to the WavPack application."
