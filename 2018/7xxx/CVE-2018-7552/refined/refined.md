Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-7552:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Invalid Free:** The primary issue is an invalid `free()` operation within the `Mapping::DoubleHash::clear()` function (specifically in `mapping.cpp:197`). This occurs when the code attempts to free memory that was not allocated by `malloc()` (or a compatible allocator).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Invalid Memory Operation:**  Specifically, an attempt to `free` memory that wasn't allocated using malloc or a compatible function, leads to the crash.
*   **Heap-Based Memory Corruption:** This invalid free can cause heap corruption, leading to undefined behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate effect of the vulnerability is a segmentation fault, leading to a program crash, resulting in denial of service.
*   **Unspecified Other Impact:** The advisory mentions "unspecified other impact" is also possible. This is due to the nature of heap corruption, the ultimate impact could be severe.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Input File:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted input file. In the provided example, the input file `017-freenomalloc-mapping` is used to demonstrate the issue.
*   **Command-Line Execution:** The `sam2p` utility is executed with the crafted input file. The specific command-line arguments used are `./sam2p 017-freenomalloc-mapping EPS: /dev/null`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Input:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted input file to the `sam2p` utility. This means the attacker must be able to execute the program and supply the malicious input.
*   **Basic Command Line Access:** No special privileges are necessary. The user running the program will encounter the vulnerability when the program parses the malicious input.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Debian bug report (#891527) lists this CVE alongside several others, all related to memory safety issues in sam2p.
*   The provided github issue #30 provides a detailed breakdown of the vulnerability, the steps required to trigger it, a crash report from AddressSanitizer, and a link to the proof-of-concept file.
*   The Debian LTS security advisory (DLA 1340-1) specifically mentions CVE-2018-7552 as being fixed in version 0.49.1-1+deb7u3 of the `sam2p` package.

**Summary**

The vulnerability is an invalid free due to an attempt to free memory not allocated using malloc leading to a crash. It is exploitable via crafted input.
