hi,

according to <https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/sam2p>
the following issues have been closed with DLAs:

thus only the following are not fixed in wheezy (sam2p is not present in

                 CVE-2018-7553 CVE-2018-7554

Multiple invalid frees and buffer-overflow vulnerabilities were
discovered in sam2p, a utility to convert raster images and
other image formats, that may lead to a denial-of-service (application
crash) or unspecified other impact.

For Debian 7 "Wheezy", these problems have been fixed in version
0.49.1-1+deb7u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your sam2p packages.
