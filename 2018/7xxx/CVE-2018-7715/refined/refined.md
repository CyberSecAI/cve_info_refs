The provided content is related to **CVE-2018-7716**, not CVE-2018-7715. The content describes a vulnerability in PrivateVPN for MacOS.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the insecure handling of the `path` parameter within the XPC service of the `com.privat.vpn.helper` privileged helper tool. The XPC service allows arbitrary installed applications to connect and send messages. The service uses the provided path string from XPC messages, which is intended to point to PrivateVPN's internal openvpn binary, to execute a binary.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation of the path string provided through XPC messages.
- Lack of verification of the path parameter, enabling the execution of arbitrary binaries.
- The XPC service does not properly validate the origin of the XPC messages allowing any installed application to communicate with it.
- The privileged helper tool has an XPC service that listens for connections from any application.
- Failure to establish a secure initial connection prevents checks of the path parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can achieve root privilege escalation.
- Arbitrary code execution with root privileges is possible.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted XPC message to the `com.privat.vpn.helper` service.
- The malicious XPC message contains a path string pointing to an attacker-controlled binary.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the target MacOS system.
- The attacker must be able to communicate with the `com.privat.vpn.helper` XPC service.
