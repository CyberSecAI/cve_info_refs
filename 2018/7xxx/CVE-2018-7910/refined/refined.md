- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in some Huawei smartphones. This vulnerability allows an attacker, who has physical access to the device, to replace the start-up program.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is an authentication bypass, meaning the normal authentication mechanisms are circumvented.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to gain control of the device, potentially accessing information stored on it, and controlling the smartphone.
- **Attack vectors:** The primary attack vector is physical access to the device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs physical access to the vulnerable smartphone.
