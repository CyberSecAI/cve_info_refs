{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Multiple dissectors, including the Thread dissector, could go into large or infinite loops due to processing malformed packets.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Infinite loop vulnerability in the Thread dissector's `get_chancount` function.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Consumption of excessive CPU resources by Wireshark.",
  "Attack vectors": "Injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to either inject a crafted packet into a network being analyzed by Wireshark or provide a malformed capture file to a user."
