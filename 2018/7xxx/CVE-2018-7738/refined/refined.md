{
  "CVE-2018-7738": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `umount` bash completion script in util-linux does not properly handle embedded shell commands in a mountpoint name.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper handling of mount point names with embedded shell commands during `umount` autocompletion.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Local users with the ability to mount filesystems can execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user performing the `umount` operation (typically root), leading to privilege escalation and potential system compromise.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access. An attacker needs to create a specially crafted mountpoint containing shell commands, which are then executed when another user (especially root) attempts to unmount it using bash autocompletion.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user with privileges to mount file systems. The vulnerability relies on another (potentially privileged) user running `umount` with a mount point generated by the attacker."
