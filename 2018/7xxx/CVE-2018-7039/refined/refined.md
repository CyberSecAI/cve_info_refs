Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the context of CVE-2018-7039:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the `ccnl_ndntlv_prependBlob` function within the ccn-lite project. The vulnerability arises from incorrect calculation of the destination address within the `memcpy` operation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:**  The `memcpy` operation in `ccnl_ndntlv_prependBlob` calculates the destination address as `buf + *offset - len`. If `*offset` is greater than or equal to `len` but not large enough to accommodate the write of `len` bytes starting from `buf + (*offset - len)`, a buffer overflow occurs. Specifically, If the offset minus length is close to zero and len is close to the buffer size, the memory write can exceed the buffer size. This happens because the function only checks if the offset is smaller than the length (in which case it returns -1, preventing an underwrite) but does not check if `*offset - len` is large enough to contain len bytes.
- **Missing Buffer Size Check:** The function lacks a check on the buffer's size, which could prevent the buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploitation of the buffer overflow vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution. By overflowing the buffer, an attacker can overwrite adjacent memory locations, including function pointers and return addresses, to redirect program flow and potentially execute malicious code.
- **Denial of Service:** An attacker could potentially cause a denial of service by triggering the overflow, leading to a crash of the application/system.
- **Information Disclosure:** Overwriting adjacent memory could lead to information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves crafting specific `blob`, `len`, and `offset` parameters to the `ccnl_ndntlv_prependBlob` function to trigger the buffer overflow.
- This could be done by providing malicious data through network packets that are processed by the vulnerable software, which calls `ccnl_ndntlv_prependBlob`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to influence the parameters (`blob`, `len`, `offset`) passed to the vulnerable function `ccnl_ndntlv_prependBlob` in a way that `offset` is not less than `len` and that the destination address will cause a memory overflow.
- This could involve sending specifically crafted packets to a system using the ccn-lite software.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided issue on GitHub includes an illustration of valid input parameters.
- The code snippet in the issue description clearly shows the lack of proper bounds checking leading to the overflow.
- The issue mentions the possibility of other similar vulnerable functions within ccn-lite.
