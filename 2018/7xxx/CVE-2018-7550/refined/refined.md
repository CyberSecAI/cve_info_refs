{
  "CVE-2018-7550": {
    "Description": "The load_multiboot function in hw/i386/multiboot.c in Quick Emulator (aka QEMU) allows local guest OS users to execute arbitrary code on the QEMU host via a mh_load_end_addr value greater than mh_bss_end_addr, which triggers an out-of-bounds read or write memory access.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of the `mh_load_end_addr` against the `mh_bss_end_addr` within the `load_multiboot` function. Specifically, the code fails to prevent a situation where `mh_load_end_addr` exceeds `mh_bss_end_addr`, leading to an out-of-bounds memory access when loading a multiboot kernel image.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read/write",
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker within the guest OS can potentially execute arbitrary code on the host system or cause a denial-of-service by crashing the QEMU process. The vulnerability could lead to privilege escalation to the level of the QEMU process.",
    "Attack vectors": "A local guest OS user can exploit this vulnerability by providing a crafted multiboot header with specific addresses that cause the out-of-bounds memory access. This typically involves manipulating the `mh_load_end_addr` and `mh_bss_end_addr` fields in the multiboot header.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have control over the guest OS and the ability to load a custom multiboot kernel image with a crafted header. The attacker also requires local access to the virtual machine."
