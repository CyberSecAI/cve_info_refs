Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7419:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the NBAP dissector of Wireshark. Specifically, the issue occurs in the `dissect_nbap_TransportFormatSet_NrOfTransportBlocks` function. A malformed or specially crafted packet can trigger a crash in this function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Crash Vulnerability:** The primary vulnerability is a crash in the NBAP dissector, stemming from a flaw in how it handles the `TransportFormatSet_NrOfTransportBlocks` field within a NBAP packet.
- **Malformed Packet Handling:** The dissector does not properly validate or handle specific malformed NBAP packets, leading to the crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability can cause Wireshark to crash. This results in a denial-of-service condition for users trying to analyze network traffic using Wireshark.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malformed Packet Injection:** An attacker can craft a malicious NBAP packet and inject it into the network traffic being captured by Wireshark.
- **Malicious Trace Files:** An attacker could provide a user with a malicious packet capture file (pcap) containing the malformed NBAP packet. When the user opens this file with Wireshark, the application will crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Packet Injection:** An attacker needs the ability to inject network traffic into a network being monitored with Wireshark. This could be achieved by being on the same network segment, or by being in a position to intercept and modify network traffic.
- **Trace File Distribution:** An attacker could distribute a malicious packet capture file, which requires no specific network access, only that a user opens the file with a vulnerable version of Wireshark.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information indicates that the vulnerability is specifically within the `dissect_nbap_TransportFormatSet_NrOfTransportBlocks` function within the NBAP dissector.
