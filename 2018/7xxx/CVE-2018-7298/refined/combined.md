# CVE-2018-7298: Downloading Firmware via Plain HTTP in HomeMatic CCU2

[Patrick Münch](https://twitter.com/atomiczero111), in 21 February 2018

# Background

HomeMatic is a home automation system consisting of various components for automating several parts of a building, including different sensors and actuators. The HomeMatic CCU2 is a central control unit, which is responsible for integrating these components with each other.

From the vendor’s website ([eQ-3](http://www.eq-3.de/produkte/homematic/zentralen-und-gateways.html)):

“The Homematic Central Control Unit CCU2 is responsible for numerous control, signalling and supervision functions across all areas of the Homematic system. The device includes a browser based user interface to the up the system. It can be controlled in the local network as well as via Internet. The Homematic software offers various configuration and application possibilities, so that there are no limits to creativity for installing your individual smart home.”

# Issue Description

While analyzing the CCU2 software, it was found that the system’s crontab file contains an entry for invoking the script `/usr/local/etc/config/addons/mh/loopupd.sh` on a regular basis. This script contains the following code:

```
ADDONDIR=/usr/local/etc/config/addons/mh

#altes Schluessel-Paket loeschen
v1=`rm $ADDONDIR/vpnkey_ccu2.tar.gz`
v1b=`rm $ADDONDIR/newver`
#
#das Paket des Benutzers herunter laden
v2=`/usr/bin/wget -O $ADDONDIR/newver 'http://www.meine-homematic.de/getverv2.php?id=29294&key=s35m89s3k73e19y7' -q`
#

```

It can be observed that software update packages are downloaded via the HTTP protocol, which does not provide any cryptographic protection of the downloaded contents. An attacker with a privileged network position (which could be obtained via DNS spoofing or other approaches) can exploit this issue in order to provide arbitrary malicious firmware updates to the CCU2. This can result in a full system compromise.

# Welcome

Todayâs world is heavily influenced by IT systems. Computers and software make our life easier, provide us with real-time communication all around the world, automate our production processes, manage our money. More and more companies and individuals rely on IT systems for their daily business, which implies that reliability and security of IT infrastructure becomes an increasingly important factor.

We support our clients in analyzing and evaluating their IT security risks by conducting design and/or code reviews in source and binary, by performing penetration tests and by providing individual solutions for custom IT security problems. We offer a broad spectrum of [services](services.html) - ranging from code reviews over penetration testing to our dedicated security services for agile software development.

Another element of our work is research. This includes both, theoretical and practical aspects in offense and defense: from improving the security of next-generation IT systems to building better reverse-engineering tools. If you are interested or would like to contribute, please feel free to contact us. Whatever the research outcome is - be it a conference talk, a paper or a tool - we believe that giving back something to the community is a good thing.

Please feel free to get in [touch](contact.html) with us!
