{
  "CVE-2018-7658": {
    "description": "The Softros Network Time System Server 2.3.4 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. The `NTSServerSvc` service listens on port 7001 and can be crashed by sending a payload of exactly 11 bytes to the target system.",
    "root_cause": "Sending a specific 11-byte payload to the server causes a crash due to an access violation when the service attempts to write data to an invalid memory address.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Denial of Service (DoS)",
      "Access violation"
    ],
    "impact": "The server crashes, disrupting time synchronization services. Systems dependent on accurate time synchronization could be impacted.",
    "attack_vectors": "A remote unauthenticated attacker can send a crafted packet to the vulnerable server.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker only needs network access to port 7001 of the vulnerable server and the ability to send network packets.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs because the server attempts to write to memory address 0x0, resulting in an access violation."
