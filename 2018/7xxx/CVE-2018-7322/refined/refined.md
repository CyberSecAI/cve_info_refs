Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7322:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the possibility of multiple dissectors in Wireshark entering large or infinite loops due to malformed packets. Specifically, the DICOM dissector is identified as having an infinite loop issue in the `dissect_dcm_tag` function.
- This is due to improper handling of crafted packets that can cause the dissector to get stuck in a loop instead of processing the packet correctly.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Infinite Loop:** The core issue is the potential for infinite loops within various dissectors, leading to excessive resource consumption.
- **Malformed Packet Handling:** The dissectors are unable to properly handle malformed packets which triggers these loops.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Excessive CPU Consumption:** An attacker can cause Wireshark to consume excessive CPU resources, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Denial of Service:** By injecting malformed packets (either on the wire or by getting a user to open a malformed capture file) an attacker can effectively render a Wireshark instance unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Injection:** An attacker can inject malformed packets directly onto a network being monitored by Wireshark.
- **Malicious Capture Files:** An attacker can send a malicious packet capture file to a user, which, when opened by Wireshark, will trigger the infinite loop.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to inject packets:** For network-based attacks, the attacker needs the ability to send malformed network packets to the target.
- **Ability to deliver capture files:** For file based attacks, the attacker needs the ability to deliver a crafted packet capture file to the victim and have them open it with the vulnerable version of Wireshark.
- **No special privileges required:** The attacker does not need any special privileges on the victim's system.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects multiple dissectors, including ASN.1 BER, DICOM, DMP, LLTD, OpenFlow, RELOAD, RPCoRDMA, RPKI-Router, S7COMM, SCCP, Thread, Thrift, USB, and WCCP.
- The provided content includes links to the specific gitlab issues related to these vulnerabilities, which may contain further detail.
- Patches are available in Wireshark versions 2.4.5 and 2.2.13 and later.
