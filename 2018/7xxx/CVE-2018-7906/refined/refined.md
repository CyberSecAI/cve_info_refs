- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient verification of parameters within a Huawei smartphone application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper parameter validation leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation results in a black screen on the affected smartphone, requiring a restart to recover.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack requires a malicious application to be installed on the victim's device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick the user into installing a malicious application on their Huawei smartphone. The attacker is considered local once the application is installed.
