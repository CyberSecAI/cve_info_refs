Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7335:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the IEEE 802.11 dissector of Wireshark. A malformed 802.11 packet can trigger a crash in the `_gcry_aes_cbc_enc` function, specifically during the `AirPDcapPacketProcess`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The core issue is a crash within the dissector when processing a malformed IEEE 802.11 packet. This is due to incorrect handling of certain packet structures/fields.
- The vulnerability is located in the `libwireshark` dissection engine.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability can cause Wireshark to crash. This could disrupt network analysis, which is the primary use case of Wireshark.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Injection:** An attacker can inject a crafted, malformed 802.11 packet onto the network that is being monitored by Wireshark.
- **Malicious Capture File:** An attacker could create a malformed packet capture file (.pcap) containing the crafted 802.11 packet and convince a user to open it with Wireshark.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to either inject packets into the network being monitored or the ability to deliver a malicious packet capture file to the victim.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was identified through fuzzing by oss-fuzz
- The affected versions range from 2.4.0 to 2.4.4 and 2.2.0 to 2.2.12, and the fix was introduced in 2.4.5 and 2.2.13
-  The issue can be triggered by a specially crafted UDP packet, as shown in the minimized test case.
