Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7884:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the DisplayLink Core Software installer version 8.2.1956. During installation or updates, a binary named `cl_1956.exe` (Cleaner Application) is extracted to the `%SYSTEMROOT%\Temp` directory. This directory is writable by regular users on Windows 10. The `cl_1956.exe` is then executed with SYSTEM privileges using the command line `C:\Windows\TEMP\cl_1956.exe -min -maxVersion 8.2.1956.0`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **DLL Hijacking:** The `cl_1956.exe` binary is vulnerable to DLL hijacking. It attempts to load several DLLs that are not marked as known DLLs which allows an attacker to place a malicious DLL with the same name in the same directory and have the program load that malicious DLL. Specifically, the report mentions `wtsapi32.dll` as a vulnerable target for hijacking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A local, unprivileged attacker can achieve SYSTEM level privileges. By placing a malicious `wtsapi32.dll` into the `%SYSTEMROOT%\Temp` directory, they can have it loaded and executed by the `cl_1956.exe` process, which runs as SYSTEM, resulting in arbitrary code execution at the SYSTEM level.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the target machine.
- **File System Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to write files into the `%SYSTEMROOT%\Temp` directory.
- **DLL Placement:** The attacker must create and place a malicious DLL in the temp directory before the vulnerable executable is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Account:** The attacker only needs to have a regular, unprivileged user account on the target Windows system.
- **Write Access:** They must have write permissions to the `%SYSTEMROOT%\Temp` directory.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 08/03/2018.
- The vendor released a fix on 29/05/2018
- This vulnerability is a privilege escalation attack.
