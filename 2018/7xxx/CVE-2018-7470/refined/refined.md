The provided content relates to CVE-2018-7470.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A segmentation fault occurs due to a wrong pointer access when processing a crafted WEBP image. Specifically, the issue occurs within the `ReadWebPLSBWord` function, which is called by `IsWEBPImageLossless` and `ReadWEBPImage`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a segmentation fault triggered by a malformed WEBP file, indicating a potential out-of-bounds read or write due to incorrect pointer handling within the webp.c file. This could be due to an incorrect calculation of offsets or length when accessing data, leading to a memory access violation.

**Impact of exploitation:** The impact is a crash of the ImageMagick process when processing the crafted WEBP image. This could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) if an attacker can provide a crafted image to a service using ImageMagick. The process crashes with an `AddressSanitizer: SEGV` error, indicating the memory access violation.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a specially crafted WEBP image file. An attacker needs to provide this crafted image to an ImageMagick process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious WEBP file as input to ImageMagick for processing (e.g. via `identify` or other tools). The attacker does not need to be in a privileged position, as the vulnerability exists within the image processing logic itself.
