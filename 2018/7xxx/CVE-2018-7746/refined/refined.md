Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7746:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of authentication checks on specific endpoints within the Cobub Razor application. Specifically, the `/index.php?/manage/channel/modifychannel` endpoint does not require authentication, which allows unauthenticated users to modify channel data. Additionally, user creation endpoint `/index.php?/install/installation/createuserinfo` lacks proper authentication and can be accessed without login.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The lack of authentication on the identified endpoints allows attackers to craft malicious HTML forms that, when visited by a victim, can trigger unintended actions, such as modifying channel information or creating a user, without the victim's knowledge or consent.
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By exploiting the lack of authentication on `/index.php?/manage/channel/modifychannel`, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `channel_name` parameter. This XSS payload is stored in the database, and when an administrator accesses the channel management page (`/index.php?/manage/channel`), the malicious code is executed in their browser.
*  **Insecure User Creation**: The lack of authentication on `/index.php?/install/installation/createuserinfo` allows any user to create an account using a crafted form without requiring proper authorization or login.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (via Stored XSS):** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of an administrator's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or further malicious actions.
*   **Unauthorized Data Modification:** An attacker can manipulate the application's data, such as channel names, which may have other consequences within the application.
*   **Unauthorized User Creation**: An attacker can create a new administrator account in the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **CSRF:** Attackers can exploit this via crafted HTML forms, that once a user visits, will perform actions on their behalf without their knowledge. This could be distributed through a website, email, or other malicious means.
*   **Direct Access to vulnerable endpoints:** An attacker could craft a direct HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoints and bypass application logic and authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the CSRF vulnerability or create a user.
*   The attacker needs to be able to persuade an administrator to visit a page containing malicious HTML, either directly or indirectly (for the stored XSS).
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request to the vulnerable endpoints.

**Additional details:**
* The vulnerability was found in Cobub Razor version 0.7.2
* The vulnerability was reported on 2018-03-07 and made public on 2018-04-06
