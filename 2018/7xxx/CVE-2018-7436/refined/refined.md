Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-7436:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer over-read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer over-read in the `parse_SST` function within the FreeXL library. The specific location of the over-read is a pointer dereference within this function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to a crash from the heap-based buffer over-read.
- The AddressSanitizer output provided in the Red Hat bugzilla entry shows a read of size 1 byte at an address located outside the allocated memory region which causes a crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves processing a crafted malicious Excel (.xls) file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious .xls file to an application using the vulnerable FreeXL library.
- No special capabilities or privileges are required.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by "Leon" of Weiran Labs.
- A proof-of-concept (POC) file that triggers the crash is provided in the Red Hat bugzilla entry, demonstrating a read of 1 byte past the allocated memory region.
- The vulnerability exists in FreeXL versions prior to 1.0.5, which is the version that has the fixes.
- The fix for this vulnerability involves correcting how the function parses the SST record in the file
