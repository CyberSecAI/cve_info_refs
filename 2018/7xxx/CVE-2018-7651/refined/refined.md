The provided content is related to CVE-2018-7651.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a regular expression used for strict Subresource Integrity (SRI) validation. The previous regex was vulnerable to ReDoS (Regular expression Denial of Service) attacks. This vulnerability existed when the `strict` option was enabled.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **ReDoS vulnerability:** The original regex `^([^-]+)-([A-Za-z0-9+/]+(?:=?=?))([?\x21-\x7E]\*)$`  was susceptible to ReDoS attacks when processing exceptionally long base64 hash strings. The regex used unbounded quantifiers on character classes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** An attacker could craft malicious SRI strings with long base64 hash components, leading to excessive processing time by the regex engine and potentially causing a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafting specially crafted, long base64 hash strings for SRI.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply malicious SRI strings to be validated by the vulnerable regex in the application. This would typically be through a network request that involves validation against the strict SRI regex.
- The application has to be using the `strict` option for SRI validation.
