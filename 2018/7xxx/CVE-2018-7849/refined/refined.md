Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-7849

**Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the UMAS (Unified Messaging and Application Services) strategy transfer functionality of the Schneider Electric Modicon M580 programmable automation controller. Specifically, if the uploaded strategy during the transfer process does not implement file integrity checks correctly, it triggers a recoverable fault state.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper file integrity checks during the strategy upload process. This allows a specially crafted, malicious strategy to cause a fault.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Exploiting this vulnerability results in a denial-of-service (DoS). The device enters a recoverable fault state, ceasing normal operations, removing existing strategy and requiring the use of programming software UnityPro for recovery.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is network-based.
    *   The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted sequence of UMAS commands over the network to the Modicon M580 controller.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs network access to the Modicon M580 controller.
    *   The attacker does not need authentication to trigger the vulnerability. They can send unauthenticated UMAS commands.
    * The attacker needs to be able to send a specific sequence of crafted UMAS commands, including an upload of a malicious strategy file.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability is triggered during the process of uploading a new strategy to the controller. The process involves a series of UMAS commands:

1.  **TAKE\_PLC\_RESERVATION:** Obtains a session and privilege to send privileged commands.
2.  **INITIALIZE\_UPLOAD:**  Indicates a new program upload will follow.
3.  **UPLOAD\_BLOCK:** Sends the first block of data.
4.  **0x6D Command:** A specific command with function code 0x6D must be sent before sending blocks of the new strategy.
5.  **UPLOAD\_BLOCK:** Sends the new strategy in chunks of 0x3F4 bytes, including a repeat of the first block.
6.  **END\_STRATEGY\_UPLOAD:** Signals the end of the upload.
7.  **RELEASE\_PLC\_RESERVATION:** Releases the reservation.

The vulnerability occurs when the uploaded strategy does not pass file integrity checks which is then detected at the **END\_STRATEGY\_UPLOAD** step. The provided proof-of-concept exploit uses a crafted strategy to trigger the fault.

**Affected Product:**
*   Schneider Electric Modicon M580 programmable automation controller firmware version SV2.70

**CVSS Score:** 7.5 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
