{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a missing header file include, which leads to a PHP error message.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The application attempts to include the 'header.php' file using a relative path, which causes a 'file not found' error when the file does not exist, thus revealing the full server path in the error message.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The primary impact of this vulnerability is the leakage of the web site's physical path, which can be used by attackers to further exploit other vulnerabilities or gain unauthorized access to the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by directly accessing the vulnerable script 's1.php' via HTTP.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker only needs to be able to access the web application, no further authentication or specific privileges are required."
