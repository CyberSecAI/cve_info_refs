Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** SQL injection in the `sessionid` parameter of the Joomla! PrayerCenter component.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `sessionid` parameter, allowing for the injection of arbitrary SQL queries.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database by injecting SQL code.  The provided proof of concept attempts to extract database table names and other database information.
*  **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exposed via an HTTP GET request to the `/index.php` with specific parameters `option=com_prayercenter`, `task=confirm`, `id=1`, and a malicious SQL payload injected into the `sessionid` parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla! application. No authentication is explicitly required for the injection point.

The provided exploit example shows a crafted URL which, when accessed, will trigger the SQL injection vulnerability. The attacker can use this to obtain sensitive information from the database.
