Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2018-7702:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of authentication and authorization checks in the SecurEnvoy SecurMail application. Specifically, the application does not require authentication for sending encrypted emails.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authentication:** Clients can send encrypted emails without authenticating to the SecurEnvoy server.
- **Missing Authorization:** There are no authorization checks performed during the email sending process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker with network access to the server can:
- Send arbitrary emails that appear to come from any sender address.
- Resend previous communications to arbitrary recipients, effectively allowing them to extract all emails stored on the server.
- Modify arbitrary messages stored on the server.
- Overwrite attachments or message bodies of previously sent emails.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the SecurEnvoy server to exploit the vulnerability.
- **API abuse:** The vulnerability lies in the SecurMail API used to send email.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the SecurEnvoy server is required.
- No authentication or authorization is required, allowing any network-connected entity to send or modify email.

**Technical Details:**
- Sending an email involves three unauthenticated steps:
  1. GETINFO request to obtain a message ID.
  2. Upload the message body and attachments.
  3. STORE request to send the message to recipients.
-  The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute step 3 while specifying their own email address and message ID to extract messages from the server.
- An attacker can modify attachments by executing step 2 to upload arbitrary content

**Additional notes:**
- The exploit-db entry confirms that this vulnerability was found as part of multiple vulnerabilities in SecurEnvoy SecurMail 9.1.501, and was fixed in version 9.2.501 or hotfix patch "1_012018"
