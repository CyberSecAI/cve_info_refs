Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Multiple dissectors in Wireshark, including all ASN.1 BER dissectors and others like DICOM, DMP, LLTD, OpenFlow, RELOAD, RPCoRDMA, RPKI-Router, S7COMM, SCCP, Thread, Thrift, USB, and WCCP, could enter large or infinite loops due to malformed packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability stems from flaws in how these dissectors process certain malformed packets, causing them to get stuck in loops. Specifically, the RELOAD dissector's `dissect_statans` function was identified as being vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:** By injecting a specially crafted (malformed) packet onto the network or convincing someone to open a malicious packet capture file, an attacker can cause Wireshark to consume excessive CPU resources, potentially leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
   - Injecting a malformed packet onto the network being analyzed by Wireshark.
   - Convincing a user to open a malicious packet trace file (pcap).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs the ability to inject network traffic into a network being analyzed by Wireshark or deliver a malicious packet capture file to a user.
   - No specific privileges are required.

**Additional Information:**
  - The provided links to Wireshark issues highlight multiple instances of this vulnerability across different dissectors.
  - The fix involves upgrading to Wireshark versions 2.4.5, 2.2.13 or later to address the looping issues.
  - The Debian LTS advisory indicates this CVE was fixed in wireshark version 1.12.1+g01b65bf-4+deb8u6~deb7u10 for Debian 7.
