| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1094819#c0)  Adrian Schröter   2018-05-28 07:16:32 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 771509](attachment.cgi?id=771509 "api_InitializeDevelPackage_attribute_exploit.txt") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=771509&action=edit "api_InitializeDevelPackage_attribute_exploit.txt") api_InitializeDevelPackage_attribute_exploit.txt  Reported from Marcus Hüwe:  currently, it is possible that an unprivileged user can modify an arbitrary package by exploiting the InitializeDevelPackage attribute (due to a missing permission check in the api code). For the details, have a look at the attached api_InitializeDevelPackage_attribute_exploit.txt file. The attached 0001-frontend-Add-additional-permission-check-for-a-submi.patch is a potential fix. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1094819#c1)  Adrian Schröter   2018-05-28 07:18:16 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 771510](attachment.cgi?id=771510&action=diff) [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=771510&action=edit) proposed patch ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1094819#c2)  Adrian Schröter   2018-05-28 07:30:48 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 771513](attachment.cgi?id=771513&action=diff "proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=771513&action=edit "proposed patch") proposed patch ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1094819#c3)  Adrian Schröter   2018-05-28 07:33:45 UTC  ``` sorry, first attached patch belong to another issue. Please ignore it here. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1094819#c4)  Adrian Schröter   2018-05-28 07:55:56 UTC  ``` The possible modification is limited to create the branch (_link file). Of course still a problem since a change afterwards in link target is influencing the build result.  It would be good if submit request creation fails, if the attribute is set and the request creator has no write access in source.  However, this would not solve the security aspect here, since the attribute could be created after the request creation. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1094819#c5)  Marcus Hüwe   2018-05-28 09:08:56 UTC  ``` (In reply to Adrian Schröter from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=1094819#c4)) > It would be good if submit request creation fails, if the attribute is set > and the request creator has no write access in source.   Removing the skip_source check should achieve this (then we could also move this code into check_permissions!) (note: this is just off the top of my head since I do not have the patch at hand atm (and the attachments to this bug seem to be invisible for me)).  > However, this would not solve the security aspect here, since the attribute > could be created after the request creation.  The patch checks if the one that tries to accept the request can modify the source package. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1094819#c6)  Marcus Meissner   2018-05-28 14:20:33 UTC  ``` use CVE-2018-7689 for this issue. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1094819#c7)  Björn Geuken   2018-06-06 12:38:40 UTC  ``` The patch is now released to OBS 2.9. build.opensuse.org was already patched.  I assume we can close the bug now ``` |  |

OBS 2.9.3 released
==================
We're happy to announce the release of Open Build Service Version 2.9.3.
This release includes 2 security fixes and we recommend to update your
OBS instance as soon as possible.
Please check out the release notes for further details or contact us.
In addition this release includes a couple of bugfixes for the OBS
frontend and backend.
Install 2.9
=========
Please read our setup instructions
[https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/blob/2.9/README.md#installati...](https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/blob/2.9/README.md#installation)
or even better, use our appliance
[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/OBS:/Server:/2.9/images/](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/OBS%3A/Server%3A/2.9/images/)
Update to OBS 2.9
===============
In case you update from a previous OBS stable release please read
the README.UPDATERS file which comes with this version.
<https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/blob/2.9/dist/README.UPDATERS>
OBS Appliance users who have set up their LVM
<http://openbuildservice.org/download/#appliance_config>
can just replace their appliance image without data loss. The migration
will happen automatically.
Details from Release Notes
===================
Features
=======
Backend:
\* Allow to use different scheduling strategy which handles large
build dependency cycles
better. Enable it via project config:
BuildFlags: genmetaalgo:1
Bugfixes
========
Frontend:
\* Fixes permission issue that allowd unpermitted users to trigger
services via the webui.
\* Permits setting the initial bs request state. This prevents setting
the initial state
to something else than 'new' (CVE-2018-7689).
\* Fixes permission check for projects with 'InitializeDevelPackage'
attribute (CVE-2018-7688).
\* Fixes rendering of requests with multiple submit requests.
Previously switching tabs would
not trigger a reload of the request content for the selected request.
Backend:
\* Debian fixes to 2.9 - publish ONIE binary and hashsum, enable
Secure Boot EFI signing for Debian packages.
\* New regex needssslcertforbuild for Debian builds
\* Support publishing via rsync syntax (allows to specify port numbers)
\* Make project config parser errors always visible
\* Fix corner case on wiping binaries
\* Improved .changes merge handling
\* Don't publish unneeded files of appdata in meta data
\* Fixing lost events on restarting schedulers
\* Make errors by not reachable remote instances better visible.
