  "CVE-2018-7730": {
    "description": "A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `PSD_MetaHandler::CacheFileData` function in `XMPFiles/source/FormatSupport/PSIR_FileWriter.cpp` of Exempi. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial of service by providing a crafted XLS file.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "An integer wraparound vulnerability in the handling of data length within `PSD_MetaHandler::CacheFileData` can lead to a heap-based buffer overflow. Specifically, a crafted XLS file with a `dataLen` of `0xffffffff` can result in a small `dataTotal` value that bypasses the `CheckFileSpace` check, but the large `dataLen` causes an out-of-bounds write.",
