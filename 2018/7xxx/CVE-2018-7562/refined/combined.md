### @trasher **[trasher](/trasher)** commented [Mar 1, 2018](#issue-301347954)

| Q | A |
| --- | --- |
| Bug fix? | yes/no |
| New feature? | no |
| BC breaks? | no |
| Deprecations? | no |
| Tests pass? | yes |

Two things:

1- display a warning when checks cannot be done. User is aware of potential issue; it's up to him.

2- try to guess host (I almost never user localhost myself; and I guess most of the time called URI will not be localhost only).

Sorry, something went wrong.

indeed using server\_name may be required for vhost/ssl, but mays be different from the client side (where is it retrieved) and from the server side.... btw no perfect solution... will need a JS check from the client

Yes, this is not perfect; but maybe a bit better than just test localhost without https ;)

I totaly agree... But this will permit to get rid of "files directory is insecure". We all agree that the way to go is to store files outside the webroot ;)
