Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2018-7852:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the improper handling of specific UMAS (User Management and Access Services) commands within the Schneider Electric Modicon M580 Programmable Automation Controller firmware. Specifically, several different UMAS function codes and subcodes, when crafted maliciously, lead to uncaught exceptions and denial-of-service conditions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The following vulnerabilities are present:
*   **Uncaught Exception:** The primary weakness is the presence of uncaught exceptions when processing specific UMAS commands leading to a fault state.
*   **Inadequate Input Validation:** Lack of proper input validation of the UMAS commands. The device does not properly validate the sub-function codes leading to a fault state.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The vulnerabilities can be triggered by sending unauthenticated commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The impact of successful exploitation is a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The device can enter two fault states:
*   **Non-recoverable fault state:** In this state, remote communications are stopped, process logic halts, and the device requires a physical power cycle to restore functionality.
*   **Recoverable fault state:** In this state, the device stops normal execution, removes existing strategy, and requires programming software (UnityPro) for recovery.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector is network-based. An attacker sends specifically crafted UMAS commands over the network to the Modicon M580 controller. The protocol used is UMAS which is usually encapsulated within Modbus TCP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs network access to the targeted Modicon M580 controller.
*   The attacker does not need to authenticate to the device.
*   The attacker needs the ability to send raw TCP packets to the device on port 502.

**Specific Vulnerability Details:**

The following UMAS function codes and subcodes are identified as vulnerable:

1.  **Function Code 0x6d, Subcode 0x00, SubSubcode 0x80**: This combination leads to a non-recoverable fault state requiring a physical power cycle.
2.  **Function Code 0x6d, Subcode 0x00, SubSubcode 0xf9**: This combination causes a recoverable fault state requiring UnityPro software for recovery.
3.  **Function Code 0x6d, Subcode 0x01, followed by subcodes 0x8b and 0x86**: This sequence of commands results in a non-recoverable fault state.
4.  **Function Code 0x6d, Subcode 0x78**: This code causes a recoverable fault state requiring UnityPro software for recovery.
5.  **Function Code 0x6d, Subcode 0x79**: This code leads to a non-recoverable fault state requiring a physical power cycle.

The provided exploit proof-of-concept Python scripts demonstrate how to send these malicious commands using a socket connection.

**CVSS Score**:

The CVSSv3 score is 7.5, with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H, which translates to:
*   **AV:N (Network):** The vulnerability can be exploited over a network.
*   **AC:L (Low):** The attack complexity is low.
*   **PR:N (None):** No privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **UI:N (None):** No user interaction is required.
*   **S:U (Unchanged):** The vulnerability does not affect the scope of the device.
*   **C:N (None):** No impact on confidentiality.
*  **I:N (None):** No impact on Integrity.
*   **A:H (High):** High impact on availability.
