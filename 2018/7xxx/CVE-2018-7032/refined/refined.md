Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `webcheckout` component of `myrepos` did not sanitize URLs before passing them to `git clone`. This allowed for the injection of malicious commands through specially crafted URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Missing URL Sanitization:** The primary weakness was the lack of sanitization of URLs before using them in a `git clone` command.
2.  **`git-remote-ext` exploitation:** The `ext::` protocol handler in `git` could be abused to execute arbitrary commands.
3. **Option Injection:** While less explored, `webcheckout` was also susceptible to option injection in the git command, although a practical exploit was not found.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting malicious commands into the URL, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the system running `webcheckout`.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website Operator:** A malicious website could host a crafted HTML page that, when parsed by `webcheckout`, would provide the malicious URL to `git clone`.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** A MitM attacker could intercept and modify the HTML page or the URL being passed to `webcheckout`, injecting malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to either control or intercept the content that `webcheckout` processes to extract the URL. This can be achieved either by being a malicious website operator hosting a specially crafted HTML file or by performing a MitM attack.
*   The attacker does not need to have local access, the exploitation can be done remotely via crafted url.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was initially considered a `git` bug due to the `ext::` protocol issue, but it was determined that `webcheckout` also needed to sanitize the URLs because users might need to re-enable git-remote-ext for specific use cases.
*   The fix involves whitelisting safe protocols for `git clone` and setting the environment variable `GIT_PROTOCOL_FROM_USER=0` for newer `git` versions to prevent the use of unsafe protocols.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in `myrepos` version `1.20180726`.
