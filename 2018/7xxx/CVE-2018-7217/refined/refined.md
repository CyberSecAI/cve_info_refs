Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the lack of server-side validation of uploaded files in the Bravo Tejari web portal. The application relies solely on client-side checks, which can be easily bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application allows users to upload files without proper validation, enabling the upload of arbitrary file types, including malicious ones.
*   **Lack of Server-Side Validation:** The absence of server-side checks is the core vulnerability. Client-side checks are insufficient because they can be bypassed by a malicious user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious File Upload:** An attacker can upload malicious files such as executables, PDFs containing exploits, or web shells to the web server.
*   **Compromise of Application:** Successful upload of malicious files can lead to the compromise of the application, potentially allowing for further exploitation of the server and related systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The attack vector is the web interface of the Bravo Tejari procurement portal.
*   **File Upload Functionality:** The specific vulnerability lies in the file upload functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have authenticated access to the application to utilize the file upload function. This is described as "Local - Authenticated".
*   **Ability to Bypass Client-Side Checks:** The attacker must have the capability to bypass the client-side validation, which is typically done using web proxies or by directly crafting the HTTP request.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vendor was contacted multiple times but did not respond.
* The vulnerability was discovered on December 12, 2017, and publicly disclosed on February 15, 2018, after no response from the vendor.
