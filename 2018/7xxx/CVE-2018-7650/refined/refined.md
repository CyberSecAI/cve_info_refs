Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The application does not sanitize user-supplied input in the "Add New" function within the "Management User" section. Specifically, the "name" field is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Lack of input sanitization: The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input before rendering it in the browser. This allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Malicious JavaScript injection: Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code, leading to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Malicious redirects
  - Website defacement
  - Insertion of hostile content
  - User redirection
  - Browser hijacking using malware
- Code execution: Arbitrary JavaScript code execution in the user's browser.
- Information Disclosure: Access to cookies and potentially other sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attack: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- Input field: The "name" field of the "Add New" form in the "Management User" section is the attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated admin user: The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator to access the vulnerable "Add New" functionality.
- Ability to input data: The attacker needs to be able to input data into the "name" field.

**Exploit Code:**
- The provided exploit code is: `"><h1><IFRAME SRC=# onmouseover="alert(document.cookie)"></IFRAME>123</h1>` This code, when inserted into the name field, will cause a popup displaying the user's cookies when the mouse is moved over an element containing the injected code.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Log in to the admin site.
2. Go to "Management --> User --> Add New".
3. Put the payload in the "Name" field and fill in other required details, then save it.
4. Access the saved page (e.g., http://<url>/~scrictory/admin/register.php).
5. Move the mouse over the username element, which will trigger the JavaScript payload, displaying a "cookie value" popup.

**Affected Component:**
- Field Name: "Add New"
- Parameter Name: "name"

**Additional details:**
- The request method is POST.
- The vulnerable product is Hot Scripts Clone: Script Classified Version 3.1.
- The blog post explicitly mentions that this is different from CVE-2018-6878, suggesting that there are other vulnerabilities within the same product.
