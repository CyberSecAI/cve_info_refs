{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application allows path traversal through the `/cockpit/media/api` endpoint.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Path Traversal"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read, write, delete files or list directories on the server by using \"../\" in the `path` parameter.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a POST request to `/cockpit/media/api` with the `cmd` set to `readfile` and the `path` parameter containing \"../\" sequences to traverse to other folders.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No specific privileges are mentioned as a requirement, suggesting that an unauthenticated attacker may be able to exploit this vulnerability."
