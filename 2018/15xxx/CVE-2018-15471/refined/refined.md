{
  "Root cause": "A flaw in the hash handling of the xen-netback Linux kernel module.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Missing or flawed input validation in the Linux netback driver when processing requests to set or change the mapping of requests to request queues."
  ],
  "Impact": "A malicious or buggy frontend may cause the (usually privileged) backend to make out of bounds memory accesses, potentially resulting in privilege escalation, denial of service, or information leaks.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious or buggy frontend can exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted requests to the backend.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control or influence a Xen frontend that interacts with the vulnerable netback driver in the backend."
