{
  "cve": "CVE-2018-15712",
  "description": "Nagios XI 5.5.6 allows reflected cross site scripting from remote unauthenticated attackers via the host parameter in api_tool.php.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Nagios XI Business Process Intelligence (BPI) component's api_tool.php does not properly sanitize the 'host' parameter, allowing for injection of arbitrary code into the /usr/local/nagiosxi/etc/components/bpi.conf file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
	  "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the bpi.conf file. When a user views the BPI page in Nagios XI, the injected script will execute in their browser session, potentially leading to session hijacking, stealing of sensitive information, or further malicious actions.",
    "attack_vectors": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can craft a malicious URL with the 'host' parameter containing XSS payload.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the Nagios XI server. No authentication is required for initial injection, but exploitation requires an authenticated user to view the BPI view in the nagiosxi web interface."
