Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-15938:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an **out-of-bounds write**. This means that the software attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds write:**  A memory corruption issue occurs when the program writes past the boundaries of a buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to the execution of arbitrary code within the context of the current user. This allows an attacker to potentially gain control of the system, install malware, or steal sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability exists within Adobe Acrobat and Reader while processing a malformed file, specifically when parsing JPEG2000 images via the JP2KLib.dll library.
*   The attack vector involves crafting a malicious PDF file containing a specially crafted JPEG2000 image that triggers the out-of-bounds write when processed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to create or have access to a malicious PDF file containing a crafted JPEG2000 image designed to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The attacker must convince a user to open the malicious PDF file using a vulnerable version of Adobe Acrobat or Reader.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing, a technique that involves providing invalid or random data to a program to find unexpected behavior.
*   The Checkpoint research team used WinAFL (a Windows port of the AFL fuzzer) to target the `JP2KLib.dll` library.
*   The report highlights the process of creating a harness to target a specific functionality of a closed source library for fuzzing.
*   The vulnerability was found in Adobe Acrobat and Reader versions 2018.011.20063 and earlier.
*   Adobe classified this as a critical vulnerability.
