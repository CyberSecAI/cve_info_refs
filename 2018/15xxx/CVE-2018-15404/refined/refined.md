- Lack of proper input validation or resource management on HTTP requests processed by the web interface, leading to a potential resource exhaustion.
- Improper limits on size or amount of resources allowed through the web interface.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- A successful exploit can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- This occurs due to oversubscription of system resources or a component becoming unresponsive.

**Attack vectors:**
