Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-15386:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an insecure default configuration within Cisco DNA Center. This insecure configuration exposes critical management functions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Default Configuration:** The primary weakness is the presence of an insecure default configuration, which directly leads to the vulnerability.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The insecure configuration allows an attacker to bypass authentication mechanisms.
*   **Exposed Services:** Vulnerable services are directly exposed, enabling direct connections from attackers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation grants an unauthenticated remote attacker direct, unauthorized access to critical management functions.
*   **Critical System File Manipulation:** An attacker can retrieve and modify critical system files, leading to potential data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
*   **Complete System Compromise**:  The high CVSS score (9.8) indicates a critical vulnerability, implying the potential for significant and widespread impact.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely over a network.
*   **Direct Connection to Exposed Services:** The vulnerability is exploited by directly connecting to the exposed services.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the vulnerable Cisco DNA Center.
*   **No Authentication Required:**  No prior authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability, making it easily accessible to anyone with network access.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Affected Product:** Cisco DNA Center Release 1.1 is affected.
*   **Fixed Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in Cisco DNA Center Software Release 1.2 and later.
*   **No Workarounds:** There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   **Internal Discovery**: The vulnerability was found during internal security testing.
*   **No Public Exploitation:** At the time of the advisory, there were no public announcements or known malicious use of this vulnerability.
*   **CVSS Score**: The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8, classifying it as critical. The CVSS vector is CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, which translates to Network attack vector, Low attack complexity, No privileges required, No user interaction, Unchanged scope, High impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
