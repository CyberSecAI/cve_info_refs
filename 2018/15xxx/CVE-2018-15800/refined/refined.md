Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-15800:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a timing attack vulnerability in the Cloud Foundry Bits Service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Timing attack vulnerability: The Bits Service has a flaw that allows attackers to discern information about the signing key by observing the time it takes for the service to respond to different requests. This can be exploited because the time taken for the service to check the key is dependent on the correctness of the key used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete read and write access to Bits Service storage:** By successfully extracting the signing key, a malicious user can gain full control over the storage of the Bits Service. This includes the ability to read, modify, and delete data within the storage.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attack can be carried out by a remote malicious user.
- **Timing Attack:** The attacker exploits the time taken by the service to process requests. The variations in response time reveal information about the signing key.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the Bits Service.
- **Ability to measure response times:** The attacker needs a mechanism to accurately measure the time taken by the Bits Service to respond to their requests. This can be done using automated scripting and tools.
- **Knowledge of the Bits Service API:** The attacker needs to know how to make requests to the service to trigger the timing vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The affected versions are Bits Service release versions prior to 2.18.0.
- The issue was reported by Christopher Brown of VMware.
- The vulnerability is classified as "High" severity.
