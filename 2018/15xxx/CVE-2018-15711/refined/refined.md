{
  "CVE-2018-15711": {
    "root_cause": "The application allows a low-privileged authenticated user to force API key regeneration for any Nagios XI user, including admins.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure API key management",
      "Insufficient access control"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious user can regenerate the API key of a more privileged user, and then use the new key to execute API calls at elevated privileges. This could allow the attacker to create new admin users or perform other administrative actions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network access",
      "HTTP requests to the Nagios XI server"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have valid credentials for a low-privileged user account on the Nagios XI instance."
