```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it on the \"Help Desk Technicians\" screen under \"AD Delegation\".",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "HTML Injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML code into the page, potentially leading to malicious activity like phishing, session hijacking, or defacement.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a crafted POST request to `http://172.16.2.105:8080/ADMPTechnicians.do?methodToCall=listTechnicianRows` with malicious HTML code within the `searchText` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. This likely requires some level of access to the application or its network. The attacker must also know the correct endpoint to target (AD Delegation > Help Desk Technicians) and be able to construct a POST request with the appropriate parameters."
