Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-15494:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an unescaped string injection within the `dojox/Grid/DataGrid` component of the Dojo Toolkit.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unescaped String Injection:** The `DataGrid` component was vulnerable to injecting unescaped strings. This means user-supplied input was not properly sanitized before being used in the application's code, which can lead to unexpected behavior or malicious code injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution/XSS:** By injecting malicious strings, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser. This could lead to a variety of impacts, including but not limited to:
    *   Stealing user session cookies or other sensitive information.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge or consent.
    *   Defacing the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through user-supplied input that is processed by the `dojox/Grid/DataGrid` component. This could occur through various means, such as:
    *   Manipulating URL parameters.
    *   Submitting crafted data through forms.
    *   Modifying data within the grid itself.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to influence the input that is processed by the vulnerable `DataGrid` component. This could mean the attacker needs:
    *   The ability to submit a specifically crafted request containing malicious strings that are then rendered by the grid.
    *   The ability to interact with a website that uses the vulnerable `dojox/Grid/DataGrid` component and where data is not properly sanitized before being displayed within the grid.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Moritz Bechler of SySS GmbH.
*   A fix was implemented and is available in Dojo Toolkit version 1.14 and backported to 1.13.1, 1.12.4, 1.11.6, and 1.10.10.
*   The provided information does not clarify the specific location or method of string injection within the `DataGrid` component.
