Here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2018-15378:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how ClamAV handles unpacking MEW (possibly a type of executable) files. The unpacking process was flawed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Handling of MEW Executables:** ClamAV's MEW unpacker had a flaw that could be exploited.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A successful exploit could cause ClamAV to crash, leading to a denial of service. This means that the ClamAV service would become unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted EXE File:** The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted EXE file to ClamAV for scanning. This file exploits the flaw in the MEW unpacking logic.
*   **Remote Attack:** The attack can be performed remotely, meaning the attacker doesn't need local access to the system running ClamAV.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Malicious File:** The attacker needs to be able to submit the malicious, crafted EXE file to be processed by ClamAV. This could be through various channels (e.g., email scanning, web uploads).
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users.

**Additional details:**
*   The Gentoo advisory mentions that the vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
*   The Debian advisory confirms that the vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated remote attackers.
*   The Ubuntu advisories (USN-3789-1 and USN-3789-2) describe that the specially crafted file can make clamav crash, leading to a denial of service.

In summary, CVE-2018-15378 describes a denial-of-service vulnerability in ClamAV caused by a flaw in the MEW unpacker, which is triggered by a specially crafted executable file. Remote unauthenticated attackers can exploit it.
