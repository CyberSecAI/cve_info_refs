"title": "Summary",
"text": "A vulnerability in the TCP ingress handler for the data interfaces that are configured with management access to Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an increase in CPU and memory usage, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient ingress TCP rate limiting for TCP ports 22 (SSH) and 443 (HTTPS). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted, steady stream of TCP traffic to port 22 or 443 on the data interfaces that are configured with management access to the affected device.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-firepower-dos [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-firepower-dos\"]"

The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco FTD Software Release 6.2.0:\r\n\r\n\r\n> show version\r\n ---------------------[ ftd ]--------------------- Model : Cisco ASA5525-X Threat Defense (75) Version 6.2.0 (Build 362) UUID : 2849ba3c-ecb8-11e6-98ca-b9fc2975893c Rules update version : 2017-03-15-001-vrt VDB version : 279 ----------------------------------------------------\r\n Determining the SSH and HTTP Service Configurations\r\nIn the following table, the left column lists the Cisco FTD features that may be vulnerable. The right column indicates the basic configuration for the feature from the show running-config CLI command, if it can be determined. If the device is configured with any of these features, the device is affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory.\r\n Cisco FTD Feature Vulnerable Configuration HTTP service enabled1,2\r\nhttp server enable \r\nhttp    SSH service enabled1,3\r\n ssh    1 The device is vulnerable only from an IP address in the configured HTTP or SSH command range.\r\n2 All devices configured for FDM access have the HTTP service enabled.\r\n3 All devices that are managed by FMC have the SSH service enabled."

The vulnerability is due to insufficient ingress TCP rate limiting for TCP ports 22 (SSH) and 443 (HTTPS). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted, steady stream of TCP traffic to port 22 or 443 on the data interfaces that are configured with management access to the affected device.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco FTD Software:    + 3000 Series Industrial Security Appliances (ISAs)   + Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) 5500-X Series Firewalls   + Firepower 2100 Series   + Firepower 4100 Series   + Firepower 9300 Security Appliances   + FTD Virtual (FTDv) For information about which Cisco FTD Software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Determining the Cisco FTD Software Release To determine which Cisco FTD Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the **show version** command in the CLI, and refer to the output of the command. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco FTD Software Release 6.2.0:  ```   > show version      ---------------------[ ftd ]---------------------   Model : Cisco ASA5525-X Threat Defense (75) Version 6.2.0 (Build 362)   UUID : 2849ba3c-ecb8-11e6-98ca-b9fc2975893c   Rules update version : 2017-03-15-001-vrt   VDB version : 279   ----------------------------------------------------   ``` Determining the SSH and HTTP Service Configurations In the following table, the left column lists the Cisco FTD features that may be vulnerable. The right column indicates the basic configuration for the feature from the **show running-config** CLI command, if it can be determined. If the device is configured with any of these features, the device is affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory.       | Cisco FTD Feature | Vulnerable Configuration |   | --- | --- |   | HTTP service enabled1,2 | http server enable  http |   | SSH service enabled1,3 | ssh |      1 The device is vulnerable only from an IP address in the configured HTTP or SSH command range.   2 All devices configured for FDM access have the HTTP service enabled.   3  All devices that are managed by FMC have the SSH service enabled.   Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory.

By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:      <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 8.6 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 8.6 |
| Environmental Parameters |
