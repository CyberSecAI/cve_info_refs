Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-15209:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `tiff2pdf` tool, which is part of the libtiff library.
*   The specific location of the overflow is within the `ChopUpSingleUncompressedStrip` function, which is called during the processing of a TIFF image.
*   The overflow occurs when writing to the `newcounts` array, specifically in `tif_dirread.c` at line 5723.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-buffer-overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow. This occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated boundaries of a buffer on the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can lead to a crash due to the heap-buffer-overflow. This is evident from the AddressSanitizer output, which reports a crash.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, heap-buffer-overflows can often be leveraged for arbitrary code execution, given suitable control of the overflowed data. However, this is not confirmed by the provided information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious TIFF File:** The attack vector is a crafted or malformed TIFF file. When `tiff2pdf` processes this malicious file, the vulnerability is triggered.
*   **Command-line tool exploitation:** The `tiff2pdf` tool is directly exploited by providing it a malformed TIFF file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to provide input file:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the vulnerable `tiff2pdf` application with a malicious TIFF file.
*   **User interaction (likely):** The user or system needs to execute `tiff2pdf` on the crafted file.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue was discovered using afl-mem, a memory-aware fuzzer based on American Fuzzy Lop.
*   The fix for another issue, CVE-2017-11613, also addresses this vulnerability. This suggests that the root cause may be related to how libtiff handles certain aspects of TIFF image parsing and processing.
*   The issue was present in libtiff version 4.0.9 (at least).
*   The provided crash information indicates the overflow occurs within the `libtiff.so.5` shared library.
*   The provided information includes a proof-of-concept (POC) file attachment.

**Summary**

CVE-2018-15209 is a heap-buffer-overflow in libtiff's `tiff2pdf` tool which can be triggered by processing a specially crafted TIFF file. This can cause a crash and potentially lead to arbitrary code execution. This issue was addressed by the fix for CVE-2017-11613.
