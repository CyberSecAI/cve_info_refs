    "cve_id": "CVE-2018-15863",
    "description": "Unchecked NULL pointer usage in ResolveStateAndPredicate in xkbcomp/compat.c in xkbcommon before 0.8.2 could be used by local attackers to crash (NULL pointer dereference) the xkbcommon parser by supplying a crafted keymap file with a no-op modmask expression.",
    "affected_software": {
      "name": "xkbcommon",
      "version": "0.8.2"
    },
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an unchecked NULL pointer usage in the `ResolveStateAndPredicate` function. Specifically, it occurs when a crafted keymap file with a no-op modmask expression is supplied and when processing an expression of the form 'l1' in an interp section, it attempts to dereference the `args`, even if it has none.",
