{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an error that may occur if the affected software renegotiates the encryption key for an IPsec tunnel when certain TFC traffic is in flight.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Error during IPsec key renegotiation with TFC traffic"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated, remote attacker can cause an affected device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a daemon process on the affected device to crash, which could cause the device to crash.",
    "attack_vector": "An attacker sends a malicious stream of TFC traffic through an established IPsec tunnel on an affected device.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to an affected device through an established IPsec tunnel and no authentication is required."
  },
  "affected_products": [
    "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software Releases 9.6.4, 9.8.2, and 9.9.1, prior to the first fixed release",
    "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software Release 6.2.2"
  ],
    "configuration_details": "This vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software and Cisco FTD Software only if the software has been configured to accept TFC traffic by using the **crypto map <*map-name*> <*map-index*> set tfc-packets** command."
