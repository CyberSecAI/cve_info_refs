Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-15455

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the improper validation of requests stored in the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) logging database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks when an administrator views the logs in the Admin Portal. This could allow the attacker to potentially execute malicious scripts in the context of the administrator's browser session, leading to actions such as session hijacking or defacement of the admin portal.
- The impact is rated as MEDIUM severity, with low impact on Confidentiality and Integrity, and no impact on Availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack (AV:N).
- Low attack complexity (AC:L).
- No privileges required (PR:N) for the initial attack.
- User interaction is required (UI:R) because an administrator must view the malicious log entry in the admin portal.
- The scope of the vulnerability is changed (S:C), as the attacker's script is executed in the context of the admin's browser session, different from the initial log entry.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send malicious requests to the targeted system.
- The attacker doesn't need to authenticate to the system to insert a log entry.
- The attacker needs an administrator to view the malicious log entry in the Admin Portal for the XSS attack to be triggered.

**Additional Information:**
- There are no known workarounds to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was found during internal security testing.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
- There are no public reports or malicious usage of this vulnerability known to the Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT).
