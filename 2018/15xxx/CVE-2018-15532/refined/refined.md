Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-15532:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Invalidly formatted API requests to the Synaptics TouchPad driver (SynTP.sys) can cause the driver to reveal freed kernel memory pointers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Leak:** The primary vulnerability is a memory leak, where the driver exposes pointers to memory that has been freed.
- **Information Disclosure:** This leak allows an attacker to potentially gain access to kernel memory addresses.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Weakened KASLR:**  The exposed kernel memory addresses can weaken the effectiveness of Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR), a security mechanism used by Windows to make it harder to exploit kernel vulnerabilities.
- **Indirect Confidentiality Impact:** The data revealed is no longer in use, so the immediate confidentiality impact is considered low and unpredictable. However, the knowledge of memory layout can aid in further attacks.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** With weakened KASLR, it becomes easier for an attacker to examine kernel memory locations and potentially exploit other kernel vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **API Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered through specially crafted API requests sent to the Synaptics TouchPad driver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system where the vulnerable driver is installed.
- **Ability to Send API Requests:** The attacker must be able to send specially formatted API requests to the Synaptics TouchPad driver (SynTP.sys).
- **Low Privilege:** The CVSS score indicates the attacker requires low privileges.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Affected Versions:** All versions of the Synaptics Pointing Device Driver prior to 6/6/2018 are affected. Drivers released after this date do not have this vulnerability.
*   **Mitigation:** The vulnerability can be fixed by updating to the latest Synaptics Touchpad drivers, specifically those released after 6/6/2018.
