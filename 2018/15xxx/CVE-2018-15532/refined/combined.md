# TOUCHPAD DRIVER SUPPORT

Synaptics' TouchPad device drivers are customized and supported by notebook manufacturers to meet specific driver requirements for their individual products. To ensure the appropriate driver for your device, always use the driver your specific notebook OEM supports.

Installing a generic driver from this website may result in the loss of OEM-customized functionality and other issues.

Before upgrading to Windows 10, first check with your notebook manufacturer for compatibility, then use your device's Windows update function to ensure you get the correct driver for your hardware.

Synaptics Security Advisory

Synaptics TouchPad Driver – SynTP.sys can leak freed pointers to kernel memory.

CVE: CVE-2018-15532

CVSS: 3.8 AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N

Affected Drivers

File Description: Synaptics Pointing Device Driver

File Versions: All versions prior to 6/6/2018. Drivers since that date no longer have this
vulnerability.

Impact

Synaptics’ TouchPad Windows driver can leak freed kernel memory pointers. This could
be used by an attacker to weaken KASLR (see below).

Background

SynTP.sys is a driver that controls Synaptics’ TouchPad families of products on
Windows. It exposes an API used to control the features of the device.

Technical Details

Invalidly formatted API requests can cause SynTP.sys to reveal freed kernel memory
pointers.

As the revealed data is no longer in use, the confidentiality impact is indirect and
unpredictable, and therefore categorized in the CVSS score as Low.

However, if the driver is not updated, these pointers could be used to analyze patterns of
kernel memory that has been previously used. This weakens the protections of
Window’s Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization, a technique that makes it more
difficult to exploit vulnerabilities in access to kernel memory. An attacker could more
easily find kernel memory locations to examine if they could somehow obtain access to
kernel memory.

Acknowledgements

Synaptics would like to thank Enrique Nissim, Senior Security Consultant for IOActive,
Inc., for reporting this issue.
