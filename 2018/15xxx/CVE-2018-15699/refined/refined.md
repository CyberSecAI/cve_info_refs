    "Root cause": "The application retrieves an update file via HTTP without proper validation of the content, specifically the Version field, allowing for injection of malicious Javascript.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [

    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the administrator's browser, potentially leading to the theft of credentials or other malicious actions.",
     "Attack vectors": [
        "Man-in-the-middle attack",
       "Manipulating the update file returned by the update server"
     ],
