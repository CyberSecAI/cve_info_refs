Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-15457:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of user-supplied input within the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The lack of input validation allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  Successful exploitation could enable an attacker to:
    - Execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface.
    - Access sensitive, browser-based information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, unauthenticated attackers:** The attacker does not need prior access to the system.
- **User interaction:** The attacker persuades a user of the affected system to click a malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious link that, when clicked by a user of the Cisco Prime Infrastructure web interface, will inject and execute the malicious script.
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication or access to the system. They simply need to trick a user into clicking the malicious link.
