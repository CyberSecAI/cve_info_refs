It appears that this might not only affect OpenSSH, I also tested this against dropbear (I'll admit not the latest release) and it seems to be vulnerable.

Dropbear has a nearly entirely different code base and the issue is not due to SSH's specs, so that is unlikely. Yet, interestingly, you are right: after running a few tests against different versions of Dropbear (v2013.58 to current) a colleague and I looked at the Dropbear code and traced it to this code in svr-auth.c (see [here](https://github.com/mkj/dropbear/blob/master/svr-auth.c#L175-L188) at GitHub):

```
#if DROPBEAR_SVR_PUBKEY_AUTH
    /* user wants to try pubkey auth */
    if (methodlen == AUTH_METHOD_PUBKEY_LEN &&
                    strncmp(methodname, AUTH_METHOD_PUBKEY,
                            AUTH_METHOD_PUBKEY_LEN) == 0) {
            if (valid_user) {
                    svr_auth_pubkey();
            } else {
                    /* pubkey has no failure delay */
                    send_msg_userauth_failure(0, 0);
            }
            goto out;
    }
#endif

```

(Where svr\_auth\_pubkey() w/malformed pubkey yields an observable that is distinguishable from the one send\_msg\_userauth\_failure() yields.)

Given the nearly entirely different code bases, it's quite a coincidence that the PoC for OpenSSH also works against Dropbear.

Issue has been reported to the vendor. Thanks for sharing your observation; credits where credits are due.

EDIT: [here](http://lists.ucc.gu.uwa.edu.au/pipermail/dropbear/2018q3/002108.html) is the post to the Dropbear mailinglist, including a reference to your comment here; and [here](http://lists.ucc.gu.uwa.edu.au/pipermail/dropbear/2018q3/002109.html) is the vendor's confirmation, noting "[...] I can confirm Dropbear has the same problem, probably all versions [...]".

Nice find! Both Dropbear and OpenSSH.. this will be used for a long time by SSH scanners.

Practically speaking how useful is enumerating users besides to determine what software is installed? Mainly so you know what username to try and crack? Not a hacker here or a pen tester but interested in this stuff as I run a security conscious company

On a recent engagement I had a certain user that I knew the password for and a list of IP addresses running SSH. Before I'd have to bruteforce against all of them with no way of knowing if it was successful or not. Now I know what hosts have that user so I can pursue them further.

Package        : dropbear
Version        : 2014.65-1+deb8u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-15599
Debian Bug     : 906890

A vulnerability in dropbear, a lightweight SSH2 server and client, making it
possible to guess valid usernames has been found:

CVE-2018-15599:

    The recv_msg_userauth_request function in svr-auth.c in is prone
    to a user enumeration vulnerability, similar to CVE-2018-15473 in OpenSSH.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
2014.65-1+deb8u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your dropbear packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>
