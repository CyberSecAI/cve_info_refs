Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-15389:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a hard-coded default username and password used during the installation process of Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning (PCP). In some instances, this default password is not replaced with a unique password after installation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Hard-coded credentials:** The presence of a default hard-coded username and password in the install function is the primary weakness.
- **Insufficient password management:** Failure to ensure the default credentials are replaced with unique passwords post-installation exacerbates the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can gain access to the administrative web interface of the affected Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning system.
- This access grants the attacker administrator-level privileges, potentially allowing them to control the system, modify configurations, and access sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote, meaning an attacker can exploit this vulnerability from a network.
- No user interaction is required, meaning the attacker does not need to trick a user into performing any action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have network connectivity to the vulnerable Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning system.
- They do not need to be authenticated (no privileges required) prior to exploiting the vulnerability, nor does the attack require user interaction to succeed.
- They must know or have discovered the hardcoded default username and password.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning versions prior to Release 12.1.
- There are no known workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this issue (fixed in Release 12.1).
- The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing by Cisco.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 8.1 (High severity), with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.
- There are no reports of public announcements or malicious exploitation of this vulnerability.
