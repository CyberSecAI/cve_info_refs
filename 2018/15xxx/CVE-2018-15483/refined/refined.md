The provided content is related to CVE-2018-15483.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The KONE Group Controller (KGC) system has a vulnerability that allows an attacker to cause a denial of service.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The system can be rebooted via the web interface.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can reboot the system repeatedly, interrupting service and causing a denial of service.
- In buildings with elevator destination control systems, this can lead to elevators being parked and unable to be called, resulting in denial of elevator service.
- In buildings with conventional elevator control, it can reduce transport capacity.
- In buildings with access control, it can be used to open or close access to specific floors.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attackers can exploit the vulnerability via the web interface of the KGC system.
- The attacker needs to have access to the same LAN as the KGC.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same LAN as the KGC.
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication.

**Additional details:**
- The KGC is usually installed in a physically secure location, such as an elevator machine room.
- The KGC is typically connected to a dedicated network.
- KONE installation instructions specify a firewall to separate the group control LAN from the building LAN.
- This vulnerability does not affect the safety of the elevators connected to the group controller.
- The vulnerability is fixed in KGC software version 4.6.5. In the updated version the HTTP and FTP services are disabled by default
- The services can be enabled for maintenance.
- Physical access to the system can still leave the KGC vulnerable to attacks
