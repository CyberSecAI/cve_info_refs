          "impact": "A low-privileged user can inject an XSS payload, and an admin user will be impacted by the attack. Malicious JavaScript cannot access session IDs stored in the cookie because they are flagged as 'httpOnly'. However, the Nagios Session Protector (nsp) value may be accessed because it is stored in the DOM. This allows an attacker to steal these tokens and subsequently create malicious forms or links to facilitate request forgery.",
