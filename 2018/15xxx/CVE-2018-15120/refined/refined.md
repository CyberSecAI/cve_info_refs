Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2018-15120:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in how Pango's emoji iterator handles invalid Unicode sequences. Specifically, sequences like `0x2665 0xfe0e 0xfe0f` can cause the emoji iterator code to return an empty segment. This, in turn, triggers an assertion failure in the itemizer, leading to a crash.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Unicode sequence handling:** The core issue is that the emoji iterator doesn't correctly handle specific invalid Unicode sequences.
*   **Assertion failure:** The vulnerability leads to a reachable assertion, which causes the application to terminate unexpectedly.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service. By providing a specially crafted Unicode sequence, an attacker can crash applications that use Pango for text rendering.
*  **Application crash:** The assertion failure causes the targeted application to crash.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious text input:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing the crafted Unicode sequences to an application that uses Pango to render text. This could be via:
    *   Instant messaging (IRC, PSN messages)
    *   Text fields in applications that render user-provided text
    *   Any other pathway that permits input of text including the crafted unicode sequence.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to send text:** The attacker needs to be able to send or provide the crafted Unicode string to a vulnerable application.
*   **No special privileges are required:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a normal message or user input, not requiring any specific privileges or access levels.

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects Pango versions from 1.40.8 (when color emoji support was introduced) up to versions prior to 1.42.4.
*   **Patch:** The fix for the vulnerability is available in Pango version 1.42.4 and the commit `71aaeaf020340412b8d012fe23a556c0420eda5f`
*   **Real-world examples:**
    *   The vulnerability affected applications like `hexchat` and `gnome-terminal`
    *   The vulnerability was exploited on PS4 consoles causing them to crash via PSN messages containing the malicious unicode sequence.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Users were advised to update their Pango libraries.
    *   PS4 users were advised to set their privacy settings to "Friends only" or "No one" for messages.
    *   Users who had their PS4 crashed were advised to delete the message using PS app or website, then to boot the console in safe mode and rebuild the database.
*   **Specific unicode sequence example:** `U+2665 U+FE0E U+FE0F`
*   **Fix:** The fix involved ensuring that the emoji iterator always makes progress, even when encountering invalid sequences. This prevents the empty segment issue that triggers the assertion.
