Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-15703:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of user-supplied input in the `broadweb/loadurl.asp` page. Specifically, several HTTP GET parameters (`title`, `url`, `lc`, `rc`, `tc`, and `bc`) are directly incorporated into the HTML response without proper encoding or filtering.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. Malicious JavaScript or HTML code can be injected through the vulnerable parameters. Because the injected code is reflected in the response, it executes in the context of the user's browser when they visit the crafted URL.
*   **Unsanitized Input:** The core issue is the failure to sanitize user input, allowing arbitrary script injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser session.
*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker can potentially steal session cookies and other sensitive information.
*   **Phishing/Malware Delivery:** The attacker can redirect the victim to a malicious site or deliver malware.
*   **Website Defacement:** The attacker may be able to modify the content of the web page.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameters:** The attack vector is through manipulation of the HTTP GET parameters of the `broadweb/loadurl.asp` page.
*   **Social Engineering:** An attacker would typically craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload and trick a victim into clicking on it, for example using a phishing email.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Needed:** No prior authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker can be an unauthenticated, remote user.
*   **Victim Interaction Required:** The attacker requires the victim to visit the malicious crafted URL to trigger the exploit.

**Additional Information:**

*   The `url` parameter is also used as the source of an iframe, potentially allowing the attacker to load content from a different site.
*   The affected products are Advantech WebAccess/SCADA versions 8.3.1 and 8.3.2
*   The severity is rated as medium with a CVSS v2 score of 4.3 and a CVSS v3 score of 6.1.
