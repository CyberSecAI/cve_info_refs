Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of S/MIME-signed emails within the Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The software fails to properly validate S/MIME-signed emails, allowing a maliciously crafted email to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Memory Corruption:** The improper validation leads to memory corruption within the ESA's filtering process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation causes the filtering process to crash and reload.
- **Permanent DoS:** The software can resume processing the same malicious email, causing a continuous crash and reload cycle, potentially leading to a permanent DoS condition.
- **System Instability:** The device could become unstable and require manual intervention for recovery.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
- **Email Delivery:** The attack vector involves sending a malicious S/MIME-signed email through the targeted ESA.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Remote Access:** The attacker does not need prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Ability to Send Emails:** The attacker needs to be able to send emails to the targeted ESA device.
- **S/MIME knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge to craft the malicious S/MIME email.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects all software versions prior to the first fixed release of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA), both virtual and hardware appliances, if S/MIME Decryption and Verification or S/MIME Public Key Harvesting is configured.
- There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability, and software updates are required for remediation.
- The CVSS score is 8.6 with a vector string of `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H`
- The vulnerability is identified as CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write).
