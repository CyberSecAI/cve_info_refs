{
  "CVE-2018-15700": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `http_parser_main` function of the web interface where the code attempts to perform string operations on an uninitialized string variable if the Referer header does not contain the `http://` protocol.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Denial of service vulnerability due to a NULL pointer dereference.",
        "Improper handling of HTTP Referer header"
    ],
    "impact": "A crafted HTTP request from an unauthenticated user on the LAN with a Referer header that doesn't contain `http://` causes the httpd service to terminate. A router reboot is required to restore the web interface.",
    "attack_vectors": "A local, unauthenticated attacker sends a crafted HTTP request with a Referer header that is missing the `http://` protocol.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be on the local network."
