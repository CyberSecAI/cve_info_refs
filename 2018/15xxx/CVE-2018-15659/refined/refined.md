Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-15659:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a weak Silverlight access policy that allows cross-origin requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Weak Silverlight Access Policy:**  The system's Silverlight access policy was misconfigured, permitting requests from any origin. This is similar to the weak CORS policy.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cross-Site Data Access:** An attacker can use a malicious Silverlight application to access sensitive data from the vulnerable SureMDM system from a different origin.
- **Unauthorized Actions:** An attacker could potentially perform actions on behalf of a victim, by exploiting this vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Silverlight Application:**  An attacker hosts a malicious Silverlight application on a website they control or have compromised.
- **User Lure:**  The attacker lures a victim into visiting the website hosting the malicious application while the victim is logged into the vulnerable SureMDM system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Host Content:** The attacker needs a web server to host the malicious Silverlight application.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs the ability to lure a victim to their malicious website.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable System:** The attacker needs to know the target URL of the vulnerable SureMDM server and resources within it.
- **Victim Authentication:** The victim needs to have an active authenticated session with the SureMDM server.

**Additional Notes:**
- The content references a public Proof of Concept (PoC) from NCC Group which was used to test this vulnerability: [https://github.com/nccgroup/CrossSiteContentHijacking](https://github.com/nccgroup/CrossSiteContentHijacking)
- This vulnerability is similar in nature to the weak CORS policy (CVE-2018-15655), allowing cross-origin requests.
- The combination of this vulnerability with other vulnerabilities (like incorrect access control and CSRF) significantly increases the potential for compromise.
