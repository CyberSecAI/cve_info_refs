KL-001-2018-009 : Dell OpenManage Network Manager Multiple Vulnerabilities

Title: Dell OpenManage Network Manager Multiple Vulnerabilities
Advisory ID: KL-001-2018-009
Publication Date: 2018.11.05
Publication URL: https://www.korelogic.com/Resources/Advisories/KL-001-2018-009.txt

1. Vulnerability Details

     Affected Vendor: Dell
     Affected Product: OpenManage Network Manager
     Affected Version: 6.2.0.51 SP3
     Platform: Embedded Linux
     CWE Classification: CWE-285: Improper Authorization,
                         CWE-284: Improper Access Control
     Impact: Privilege Escalation
     Attack vector: MySQL, HTTP
     CVE ID: CVE-2018-15767, CVE-2018-15768

2. Vulnerability Description

     Dell OpenManage Network Manager exposes a MySQL listener that
     can be accessed with default credentials (CVE-2018-15768). This
     MySQL service is running as the root user, so an attacker can
     exploit this configuration to, e.g., deploy a backdoor and
     escalate privileges into the root account (CVE-2018-15767).

3. Technical Description

     The appliance binds on 3306/mysql using the 0.0.0.0 IP
     address. The default IPTables policy is ACCEPT and the
     rule table is empty. Using any of three default accounts,
     a malicious user can exploit native MySQL functionality to
     place a JSP shell into the directory of a web server on the
     file system and subsequently make calls into it.

4. Mitigation and Remediation Recommendation

     The vendor informed KoreLogic that all default passwords can
     be changed and are documented in the OpenManage Network Manager
     Installation Guide. Dell recommends all customers change these
     default passwords upon installation.

     The vendor has addressed these vulnerabilities in version
     6.5.3. Release notes and download instructions can be found at:

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

### CVE Identifier: CVE-2018-15767, CVE-2018-15768

**Severity: Medium**

### Affected products:

Dell OpenManage Network Manager version prior to 6.5.3 (CVE-2018-15767)
Dell OpenManage Network Manager version prior to 6.5.0 (all CVEs)

### Summary:

Dell OpenManage Network Manager has been updated to address multiple vulnerabilities which may be potentially exploited to compromise the system.

### Details:

The below vulnerabilities have been addressed:

* CVE-2018-15767 – Improper Authorization Vulnerability
  The Dell OpenManage Network Manager virtual appliance versions prior to 6.5.3 contain an improper authorization vulnerability caused by a misconfiguration in the /etc/sudoers file. A malicious OpenManage Network Manager user who has ‘synergy’ account privileges could potentially exploit this vulnerability to run arbitrary commands with root privileges on the affected system.
* CVE-2018-15768 – Insecure MySQL Configuration Vulnerability
  Dell OpenManage Network Manager versions prior to 6.5.0 enabled read/write access to the file system for MySQL users due to insecure default configuration setting for the embedded MySQL database. A malicious OpenManage Network Manager user with database access privileges could potentially exploit this vulnerability to access files stored on the server filesystem.
### Resolution:

The following Dell OpenManage Network Manager release contains resolutions to these vulnerabilities:

* CVE-2018-15767 - Dell OpenManage Network Manager versions 6.5.3 and later
* CVE-2018-15768 - Dell OpenManage Network Manager versions 6.5.0 and later

Dell recommends all customers upgrade at the earliest opportunity.

### Workaround:

Customers on versions prior to 6.5.0 can follow the instructions documented below to manually remediate CVE-2018-15768.

* Disable read/write access filesystem by MySQL users:

o    Edit file: .../oware3rd/mysql/5.0.51-pc-linux-i686-64/my.cnf
