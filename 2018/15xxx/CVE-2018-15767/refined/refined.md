Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in the context of CVE-2018-15767:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of CVE-2018-15767 is an improper authorization vulnerability resulting from a misconfiguration in the `/etc/sudoers` file within the Dell OpenManage Network Manager virtual appliance.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Authorization:** The vulnerability stems from a misconfiguration that allows a user with 'synergy' account privileges to execute arbitrary commands as root. This indicates that the system's access control mechanisms are not properly configured, allowing for privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A malicious user with 'synergy' account privileges can exploit the vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the affected system. This essentially grants full control of the system to the attacker.
- **Potential Backdoor Deployment:** The provided exploit code shows that an attacker can use the MySQL vulnerability (CVE-2018-15768) to create a JSP shell on the web server and then gain remote shell access through it by executing arbitrary commands as root.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **MySQL Access:** Although this CVE directly relates to the sudoers misconfiguration, the exploit script shows that it can be chained with CVE-2018-15768 by using MySQL access to inject a JSP backdoor into the webserver to be able to execute commands on the system.
- **HTTP:** Once the JSP backdoor is dropped, the attacker can make HTTP calls to the webserver to execute arbitrary commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **'synergy' Account Privileges:** The attacker must have valid credentials for a user account with 'synergy' privileges on the Dell OpenManage Network Manager system.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Dell OpenManage Network Manager system, including the MySQL service and the web server.

**Additional Details:**
- The advisory also mentions that the MySQL service runs as root. This configuration allows for root access via the MySQL service.
- The vulnerability is present in Dell OpenManage Network Manager versions prior to 6.5.3.
- A proof-of-concept exploit is provided, which injects a JSP shell using default MySQL credentials and then executes commands using the crafted JSP shell.
- The advisory mentions that changing default passwords is a necessary step for securing the product.
- The vendor has addressed these vulnerabilities in version 6.5.3.
