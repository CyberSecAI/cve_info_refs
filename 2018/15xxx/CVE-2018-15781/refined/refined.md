The provided content is related to CVE-2018-15781.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Dell Wyse Password Encoder in ThinLinux2 versions prior to 2.1.0.01 contains a hardcoded cryptographic key.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Hardcoded cryptographic key
- Insecure storage of sensitive information (encrypted using the hardcoded key).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An unauthenticated remote attacker could reverse engineer the cryptographic system used in the Dell Wyse Password Encoder to discover the hardcoded private key. This key can then be used to decrypt locally stored ciphertext, potentially leading to the compromise of sensitive data and the system itself.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attack via network (adjacent network).
- Reverse engineering of the cryptographic system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker must be able to reach the vulnerable device through an adjacent network (as per the CVSS vector).
- The attacker must have the ability to reverse engineer the cryptographic system used in the Dell Wyse Password Encoder.
