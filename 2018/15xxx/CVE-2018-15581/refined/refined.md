Based on the provided commit diff, this commit addresses multiple XSS vulnerabilities in the gnuboard5 project by sanitizing user input with `strip_tags()` function before using it in SQL queries and HTML output.

Here's a breakdown of the changes and their implications:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The primary root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided data before using it in SQL queries or rendering it in HTML. This allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored XSS:** The code was vulnerable to stored XSS where user-supplied input (like group names, content subjects, FAQ titles, popup titles, point content, etc.) could be injected into the database and later rendered unsafely on the admin pages, affecting other users.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code directly uses `$_POST` data in SQL queries and HTML output without proper sanitization, enabling XSS attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Script Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Account Takeover:** This could be used to steal administrator session cookies or perform other actions on behalf of the administrator.
*   **Defacement:** An attacker could change the appearance of the website, potentially damaging its reputation.
*   **Data Theft:** An attacker could steal sensitive data from the administrator or other users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the admin pages where an attacker with access to the admin panel could inject malicious code via form inputs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would need access to the admin panel of the website.
*   The attacker would need to be able to manipulate form inputs that are not properly sanitized.

**Specific Changes and Their Effect:**

The commit includes changes in multiple files to sanitize input data using the PHP function `strip_tags()`:

*   `adm/boardgroup_form_update.php`: Sanitizes the `gr_subject` input.
*   `adm/boardgroup_list_update.php`: Sanitizes the `gr_subject` input.
*   `adm/contentformupdate.php`: Sanitizes the `co_subject` input.
*   `adm/faqmasterformupdate.php`: Sanitizes the `fm_subject` input.
*  `adm/newwinform.php`:  Sanitizes `nw_subject` input using `get_sanitize_input()` function.
*  `adm/newwinformupdate.php`: Sanitizes `nw_subject` input using `strip_tags()` function.
*   `adm/point_update.php`: Sanitizes `mb_id`, `po_point`, and `po_content` inputs.
*   `adm/sms_admin/num_book_update.php`: Sanitizes `bk_name` input.
*  `adm/sms_admin/num_book_write.php`: Sanitizes `bk_name` input using `get_sanitize_input()` function.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The commit also replaces direct use of $_POST variables in SQL queries with sanitized variables.

This commit provides more details than the official CVE description by showing which files were changed, and how input sanitation was applied to mitigate the XSS vulnerabilities.
