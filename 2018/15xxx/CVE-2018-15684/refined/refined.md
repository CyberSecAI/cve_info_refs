Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described for CVE-2018-15684:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the lack of access control on PHP log files. PHP errors are logged by default to files in `/include/logs/`, a directory without an index file. This allows for direct access to log files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of potentially sensitive information in PHP log files.
  - The files can contain full path disclosure, revealing the server's internal directory structure.
  -  Log files may inadvertently include sensitive data like passwords or other private details.
- **Predictable Log File Names:** Log files use a predictable naming convention making it easy to access historical log files. They are named `xbtit-errors_DD.MM.YY_.log`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker can gain access to sensitive information, including full server paths. This information could be used for further attacks, such as identifying vulnerable components, or possibly gaining access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Direct File Access:** An attacker can access the log files directly via web browser by requesting the file name, due to missing directory index file and lack of access restrictions on the log files.
- **Predictable File Names:** The consistent naming scheme allows for easily discovering current and historical logs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker needs no authentication to access log files.
- The attacker needs to know the location of the log files, which is default `/include/logs/`, and can be discovered by other vulnerabilities or by public disclosure.
