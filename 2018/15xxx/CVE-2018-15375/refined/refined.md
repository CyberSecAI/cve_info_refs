Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2018-15375:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability exists due to the presence of test commands in the embedded test subsystem of Cisco IOS Software that were intended for internal development builds only.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary Memory Write:** The test commands allow an attacker to write arbitrary values to arbitrary memory locations.
- **Unintended Functionality in Production:** The presence of development/test commands in production software.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Memory Write:** A successful exploit could allow the attacker to write arbitrary values to arbitrary locations in the memory space of the affected device. This can lead to various outcomes, including:
    - **Code Execution:** Overwriting memory with malicious code could allow the attacker to execute code on the device.
    - **Denial of Service:** Corrupting critical data in memory could cause the device to crash or become unstable.
    - **Data Manipulation:** Modifying data in memory could lead to unauthorized access or alteration of sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerabilities are exploited through the use of specific test commands.
- The attacker needs to be local to the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the device.
- **Authenticated:** The attacker must be authenticated to use the specific test commands.
