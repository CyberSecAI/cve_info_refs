{
  "CVE-2018-15508": {
    "Root cause": "The Five9 SoftPhone application opens a web server on port 8083 that accepts WebSocket connections without authentication or identity verification.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Lack of authentication/authorization for WebSocket connections",
      "Web server listening on a port without proper access controls"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can send a simple GET request or establish a WebSocket connection to the vulnerable port, causing the Five9 SoftPhone application to disconnect from the Five9 servers, effectively denying service to the end user. The application becomes unusable and drops active calls.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending a GET request to port 8083",
      "Establishing a WebSocket connection to port 8083",
      "Exploitation can be performed over the network if the attacker has network access to the victim's machine"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send network requests to port 8083 of the target machine running Five9 SoftPhone. This can be achieved from the same network, or potentially remotely if the port is accessible.",
     "Additional details": "The service running on port 8083 appears to be using WebSockets and does not encrypt communication, despite displaying certificate errors. Error messages provided by the server leak information about the required message format and expected fields."
