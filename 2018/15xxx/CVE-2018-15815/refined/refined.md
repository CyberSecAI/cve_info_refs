    {
      "cve": "CVE-2018-15815",
      "is_related": true,
      "summary": "Multiple exploitable crashes were found in FastStone Image Viewer 6.5 due to write access violations and exception handler corruption when processing specially crafted TIFF and GIF images.",
      "root_cause": "The root cause of these vulnerabilities lies in improper handling of image file formats, leading to out-of-bounds memory access during processing. Specifically, the application attempts to write to invalid memory locations due to incorrect calculations or handling of data within the image file, and also has issues with exception handling.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Memory corruption due to invalid write access",
        "Exception handler corruption",
	    "Improper input validation"
      ],
      "impact": "Exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through opening a specially crafted TIFF or GIF image file.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a crafted image file to the user. No special capabilities are needed beyond the ability to create/modify the image files and have the victim open it."
