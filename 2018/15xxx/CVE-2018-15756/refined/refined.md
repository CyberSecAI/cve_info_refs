{
  "CVE-2018-15756": {
    "Root cause": "The Spring Framework's ResourceHttpRequestHandler and annotated controllers returning an `org.springframework.core.io.Resource` support range requests. However, a malicious user can exploit this by adding a range header with a high number of ranges, wide overlapping ranges, or both.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of range requests for static resources and resources returned by annotated controllers, allowing malicious manipulation of range headers"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive resource consumption.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending a malicious HTTP request containing a range header with a high number of ranges, overlapping ranges, or both.",
      "Exploiting applications that depend on either spring-webmvc or spring-webflux with a registration for serving static resources (e.g. JS, CSS, images, and others), or have an annotated controller that returns an `org.springframework.core.io.Resource`."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
        "Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application."
    ],
    "Additional information": "The vulnerability affects applications using spring-webmvc or spring-webflux that serve static resources, or have annotated controllers returning an `org.springframework.core.io.Resource`. Spring Boot applications depending on spring-boot-starter-web or spring-boot-starter-webflux are vulnerable by default. Support for range requests was introduced in version 4.2 and support for `org.springframework.core.io.Resource` in annotated controllers was introduced in 5.0."
