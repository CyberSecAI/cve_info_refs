Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-15933:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an out-of-bounds write vulnerability within Adobe Acrobat and Reader. Specifically, this vulnerability was found in the parsing of JPEG2000 images using the `JP2KLib.dll` library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds write:** The vulnerability allows writing data outside of the allocated memory buffer. This can lead to memory corruption and potentially control the execution flow of the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the current user. This means an attacker can execute malicious code on the user's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves a malformed JPEG2000 image embedded within a PDF file. When the user opens the malicious PDF file using Adobe Acrobat or Reader, the vulnerable parser in `JP2KLib.dll` is triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Crafting a malicious PDF:** An attacker needs to craft a malicious PDF document containing a specially crafted JPEG2000 image that triggers the out-of-bounds write condition in the parsing logic.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker must lure the victim into opening the crafted PDF file using a vulnerable version of Adobe Acrobat or Reader.
