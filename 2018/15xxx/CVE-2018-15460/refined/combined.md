| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco Email Security Appliance URL Filtering Denial of Service Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20190109-esa-url-dos  First Published: 2019 January 9 16:00 GMT  Last Updated:  2019 March 13 14:25 GMT  Version 1.1:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  [Yes](#workarounds)   Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCvm81627](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvm81627)     CVE-2018-15460     CWE-770       CVSS Score: [Base 8.6](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.0&vector=CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2018-15460     CWE-770       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190109-esa-url-dos/csaf/cisco-sa-20190109-esa-url-dos.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the email message filtering feature of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliances (ESA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the CPU utilization to increase to 100 percent, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.  The vulnerability is due to improper filtering of email messages that contain references to whitelisted URLs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious email message that contains a large number of whitelisted URLs. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a sustained DoS condition that could force the affected device to stop scanning and forwarding email messages.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:   <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190109-esa-url-dos>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects all software versions prior to the first fixed release of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco ESAs, both virtual and hardware, if the **URL Filtering as Global Setting** feature is enabled and a URL whitelist is in use. By default, the **URL Filtering as Global Setting** feature is *disabled*.  To determine whether a vulnerable release of Cisco AsyncOS Software is running on an ESA, administrators can use the **version** command in the ESA CLI. The following example shows the output of the command for an ESA that is running Cisco AsyncOS Software Release **10.0.1-087**:  To check whether a Cisco ESA is configured with URL Filtering and uses a URL whitelist, administrators can navigate to **GUI > Security Services > URL Filtering**. A vulnerable device will have **URL Category and Reputation Filters** set to *Enabled* and **URL whitelist** set to any value other than  *None*. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following products:    + Content Security Management Appliance, virtual and hardware versions   + Web Security Appliance, virtual and hardware versions  Workarounds  * There are two possible workarounds to address this vulnerability:  1. If the whitelist through Global URL Filtering is not needed, administrators can disable it by following these steps:    + On the ESA, navigate to **Security Services > URL Filtering**.   + Click on **Edit Global Settings** and set **Use a URL whitelist** to *None*. This disables the global whitelist.   + Commit the Changes. 2. If the **whitelist through Global URL Filtering** feature is needed, the same level of filtering can be achieved by implementing a single whitelist per **Content Filter**, after disabling the whitelist through Global URL Filtering, as described in step 1. Administrators can choose a specific URL Reputation range or set of URL Categories to apply the whitelist to via the Content Filter. The required steps are as follows:    1. On the ESA, navigate to **Mail Policies > Incoming Content Filters**   2. [Optionally] Create a new Content Filter by clicking **Add Filter**   3. Click on the desired Content Filter **>** **Add Action > URL Reputation > Select Custom Range**   4. Input the desired range   5. [Alternatively] **Add Action > URL Categories > Add desired Categories set**   6. Choose the desired whitelist   7. Click OK > Submit   8. Commit the Changes  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:      <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.  **Customers Without Service Contracts**  Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.  **Fixed Releases**  In the following table, the left column lists major releases of Cisco AsyncOS Software for ESA. The right column indicates whether a major release is affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory and the first minor release that includes the fix for this vulnerability.      Customers should upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in the following table:       | **Cisco AsyncOS **Software** for ESA Major Release** | **First Fixed Release for This Vulnerability** |   | --- | --- |   | Prior to 9.0 | Affected; Migrate to 11.0.2-044 MD |   | 9.x | Affected; Migrate to 11.0.2-044 MD |   | 10.x | Affected; Migrate to 11.0.2-044 MD |   | 11.0.x | 11.0.2-044 MD1 |   | 11.1.x | 11.1.2-023 MD2 |   | 12.x | Not affected |       1 11.0.2-044 will run on all legacy hardware for ESA models x70, x80, x90 and the virtual appliances.2 11.1.2-023 will run on ESA models x80, x90 and the virtual appliances.  Note that Cisco provides regular maintenance of products in the Cisco   Cloud Email Security (CES) service solution, which includes Cisco Email   Security Appliances and Cisco Content Security Management Appliances.   Customers can also request a software upgrade by contacting Cisco TAC.

| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 8.6 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 8.6 |

| Environmental Parameters |
