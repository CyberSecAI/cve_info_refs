The content provided describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in a CMS application.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when adding comments to articles. Specifically, the comment content is not sanitized, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored XSS vulnerability. The unsanitized input is stored in the database and executed in the browser when viewed by other users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, stealing sensitive information, redirecting users to malicious sites, and defacing the web page.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the comment submission functionality of the CMS application. An attacker inserts malicious JavaScript into the comment field of an article.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to submit comments without authentication. No specific privileges are required, other than the ability to access and post comments.
