{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Key management error",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A key management error exists within RSA BSAFE Micro Edition Suite. This vulnerability allows a malicious TLS server to send a large prime value during the TLS handshake while using Ephemeral or Anonymous Diffie-Hellman cipher suites (DHE or ADH).",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful attack can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) on TLS clients.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious TLS server sends a very large prime value to the TLS client during the handshake.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be in a position to act as a malicious TLS server and initiate a handshake with a vulnerable TLS client."
