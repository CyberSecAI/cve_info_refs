  "CVE-2018-15658": {
    "description": "The application's session validation and redirection were carried out in the JavaScript as the page is loaded, rather than on the server-side. This allowed an attacker to view the markup of the authenticated user's interface by directly accessing the Master.html page.",
    "root_cause": "Client-side session validation and redirection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure client-side session validation",
      "Exposure of authenticated user interface markup to unauthenticated users"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could view the markup of the authenticated user's interface, which could lead to the discovery of sensitive API endpoints and further compromise of the system.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Direct access to `/console/ConsolePage/Master.html`",
        "Bypassing client-side JavaScript session validation"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "No authentication required. The attacker needs to access the URL `/console/ConsolePage/Master.html`."
