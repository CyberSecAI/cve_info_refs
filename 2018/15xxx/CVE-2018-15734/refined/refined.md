The provided content relates to CVE-2018-15734.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an arbitrary write issue in the STOPzilla AntiMalware kernel driver (`szkg64.sys`). The driver does not validate output buffer addresses.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Arbitrary write vulnerability due to lack of validation of output buffer addresses.
- The IOCTL `0x8000206B` is specifically mentioned as vulnerable to arbitrary write.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The arbitrary write vulnerability can be leveraged to overwrite the `_SEP_TOKEN_PRIVILEGES` structure to obtain the `SeCreateTokenPrivilege` privilege.
- With `SeCreateTokenPrivilege`, an attacker can create new privileged tokens.
- On Windows 7, an elevated shell can be obtained by switching to session 0.
- On Windows 10, the current user can be added to the local administrators group.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted IOCTL request (0x8000206B) to the vulnerable STOPzilla driver.
- The vulnerability is triggered locally.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to send IOCTL requests to the STOPzilla driver.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute code locally.
