- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Kraftway-24F2XG router uses outdated SSLv2 and SSLv3 protocols, which contain cryptographic weaknesses.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Usage of vulnerable SSLv2 and SSLv3 protocols.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can decrypt data transmitted through the router by performing a Man-in-the-Middle attack.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by intercepting network traffic.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be positioned to intercept network traffic between the router and other devices (Man-in-the-Middle). The attack complexity is low and no user interaction is required.
