Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2018-15864:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an unchecked NULL pointer usage within the `resolve_keysym` function in the `xkbcomp/parser.y` file of the `xkbcommon` library. This occurs because a map access attempt can occur for a map that was never created.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unchecked NULL pointer dereference
- Improper handling of crafted keymap files

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A local attacker could supply a specially crafted keymap file, leading to a NULL pointer dereference and a crash of the `xkbcommon` parser.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access: A local attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted keymap file to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local attacker access with the ability to supply a malicious keymap file.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The vulnerability is present in `xkbcommon` versions prior to 0.8.2.
- The vulnerability can cause a crash by supplying a crafted keymap file.
- The fix involves preventing the map access attempt if the map was not created.
- Multiple other CVEs are related to this issue and were fixed in the same patch
- Red Hat assigned this a "moderate" severity and it has been addressed in RHSA-2019:2079, which provided updates for multiple RHEL versions.
