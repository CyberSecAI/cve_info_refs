Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information relevant to CVE-2018-15917:

**1. Vulnerability:**

*   **Type:** Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Affected Software:** Jorani Leave Management System version 0.6.5 and potentially earlier versions.
*   **Root Cause:** The `language` parameter within the application is vulnerable to XSS attacks via a GET request. The values are stored in the user session.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   The application does not properly sanitize or validate user input provided through the `language` parameter.
*   The application stores the provided `language` parameter value in the user session without encoding it, leading to persistent XSS.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a victim's browser.
*   This could lead to:
    *   Stealing sensitive information (e.g., session cookies, user data).
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the victim without their consent.
    *   Hijacking user sessions.
    *   Potentially compromising the entire system if the browser has additional critical vulnerabilities.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Method:** Sending a specially crafted GET request to the `/session/language` endpoint.
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `language`

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload in the `language` parameter.
*   The attacker must then trick a user into visiting the crafted URL.

**6. Technical Details**

*   The vulnerable URL is similar to: `localhost/session/language?last_page=session%2Flogin&language=en%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(%27PoC%20CVE-2018-15917%27)%3C%2Fscript%3E&login=&CipheredValue=`
*   The payload `en"><script>alert('PoC CVE-2018-15917')</script>` can be used to demonstrate the vulnerability
