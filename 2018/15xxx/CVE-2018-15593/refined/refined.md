Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described, which matches CVE-2018-15593:

**Root Cause:**
- The Ivanti Workspace Control agent stores database or Relay server credentials in the Windows Registry.
- These credentials are encrypted, but the encryption algorithm used is reversible.
- The encryption key (or the method to derive it) is also stored in the registry or can be obtained by decompiling the binaries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure Storage of Credentials:**  Credentials are stored in a way that they can be accessed by local users with registry read access.
- **Reversible Encryption:** The custom encryption algorithm used is weak and can be reversed. Even when AES encryption is used (with FIPS mode), the key derivation method is insecure.
- **Registry Permissions:** While the registry values cannot be changed by unprivileged local users, they can be read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential Theft:** Local unprivileged users can retrieve the database or Relay server credentials.
- **Unauthorized Access:** With the stolen credentials, attackers can directly connect to the Relay and database servers.
- **Database Compromise:**  Attackers may be able to modify the database, potentially compromising all agents (workstations) connected to it.
- **Malicious Configuration Injection:** Attackers can trick agents into connecting to a rogue database, allowing them to execute attacker-supplied code.
- **Full System Compromise:**  Successful malicious code execution could lead to complete compromise of the affected agents.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the target system.
- **Registry Access:** The attacker needs to be able to read the Windows registry.
- **Reverse Engineering:**  Decompilation of the Ivanti Workspace Control binaries can reveal the encryption algorithm and key.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be a local user with read access to the registry on a system running a vulnerable version of Ivanti Workspace Control.
- No administrative or elevated privileges are required.
- The attacker should be able to perform decompilation of binaries and understand the custom encryption algorithm.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was verified on versions 10.2.700.1 & 10.2.950.0.
- The issue is resolved in version 10.3.10.0.
- The advisory also notes that the same database password is often used for managing the database and the Agents, which would increase the impact of a successful attack.
