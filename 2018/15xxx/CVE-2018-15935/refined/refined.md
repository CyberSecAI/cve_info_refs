**Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds write
**Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a result of an out-of-bounds write error.
**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a maliciously crafted file that triggers the out-of-bounds write during processing by Adobe Acrobat or Reader. The specific file type is not explicitly mentioned, but the Checkpoint research article indicates that the vulnerability was found in the `JP2KLib.dll` library, which is used to parse JPEG2000 files.
**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to create a specially crafted file (potentially a JPEG2000 file) and convince a user to open it with a vulnerable version of Adobe Acrobat or Reader.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is classified as "critical" severity.
*   The vulnerability is addressed in Adobe Acrobat and Reader updates released on October 1, 2018 (APSB18-30).
*   The Checkpoint Research article gives details on how the vulnerability was found using a fuzzer and reverse engineering of the `JP2KLib.dll` library.
*   The vulnerability is one of many discovered during a 50-day fuzzing effort, highlighting the effectiveness of fuzzing for discovering vulnerabilities in complex software like Adobe Reader.
