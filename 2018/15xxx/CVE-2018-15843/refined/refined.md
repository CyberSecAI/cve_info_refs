- Accessing cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
- Rewriting the content of the HTML page.
- Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload into the "Add New Page" parameter.
- The crafted input is stored by the application.
- When the page is viewed by a user, the injected script is executed in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to log in to the GetSimple CMS admin panel to create a new page.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the XSS vulnerability and how to craft the malicious payload.
