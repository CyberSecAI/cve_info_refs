The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input when editing the food category name (`fcname`). Specifically, the application does not neutralize or encode HTML special characters present in the input, which allows injection of malicious javascript.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS vulnerability
- Lack of input sanitization/output encoding

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `fcname` field, which will then be stored in the application's database. When other users (or administrators) view the affected content, the malicious script will be executed in their browsers. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Cookie theft
    - Phishing attacks
    - Unauthorized actions on behalf of the user
    - Defacement of the web page

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `http://127.0.0.1/waimai/admin.php/Foodcat/editsave`
- Malicious payload injected in the `fcname` parameter: `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have administrative privileges to access the food category editing functionality.
- The attacker needs to craft an HTTP POST request with the malicious payload and send it to the server.
