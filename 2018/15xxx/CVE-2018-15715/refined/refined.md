Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-15715:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of message validation within Zoom's thick client. This allows an attacker to send spoofed UDP messages that are treated as legitimate server commands due to the lack of proper verification.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Message Validation:** The Zoom client does not properly validate the source or authenticity of UDP messages, allowing attackers to impersonate legitimate senders.
- **Unencrypted UDP Messages Accepted:** The client appears to accept unencrypted UDP messages even when encrypted sessions are enabled.
- **Lack of Authentication:** Exploitation can occur without any prior authentication or knowledge of encryption keys.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit can lead to:
- **Hijacking of presenter's desktop:** An attacker can gain control of the presenter's shared screen.
- **Spoofing Chat Messages:** An attacker can impersonate other users or the server to send messages.
- **Kicking Attendees Out of Calls:** An attacker can forcibly remove participants from the meeting.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attacker can be located remotely and does not require physical access to the target system.
- **UDP Spoofing:** Attackers send spoofed UDP messages to the victim's Zoom client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to know the IP address of an attendee or a Zoom server IP address.
- The attacker needs to determine the meeting attendee IDs, which can be brute-forced.
- No authentication or knowledge of encryption keys is needed.
