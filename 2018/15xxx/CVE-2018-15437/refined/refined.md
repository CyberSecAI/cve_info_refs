Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Improper process resource handling within the system scanning component of Cisco Immunet and Cisco AMP for Endpoints. Specifically, a NULL DACL (Discretionary Access Control List) with RW Everyone permissions is configured on a named pipe, allowing local users to gain control over the pipe.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-  **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary vulnerability is the ability for a local attacker to disable the scanning functionality of the affected products.
- **Improper Access Control:** The use of a NULL DACL with RW Everyone permissions on the named pipe allows any local user to interact with and control the pipe, leading to the vulnerability.
- **Lack of Proper Pipe Configuration:** The absence of `PIPE_REJECT_REMOTE_CLIENTS` and `FILE_FLAG_FIRST_PIPE_INSTANCE` flags further contributes to the exploitable nature of the named pipe.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Disabling Scanning Functionality:** An attacker can prevent the scanning services of Cisco Immunet and Cisco AMP for Endpoints from functioning properly, effectively disabling the real-time protection provided by these products.
- **Unanalyzed Executables:** This can lead to the execution of malicious files without being scanned, thus increasing the risk of system compromise.
- **System Compromise:** By disabling the security software, an attacker could potentially gain deeper access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to a Windows system where Cisco Immunet or Cisco AMP for Endpoints is installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the targeted Windows system.
- The attacker needs the ability to execute programs.
- The attacker needs to be able to create/open a named pipe.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit involves creating and connecting to a named pipe (`\\.\pipe\IMMUNET_SCAN`) used by the vulnerable software. By repeatedly creating and connecting to this pipe, the attacker can exhaust the available pipe instances, preventing legitimate service processes from using it, resulting in a denial of service condition.

**CVE Details:**

- **CVE-2018-15437** is assigned to this vulnerability
- **CVSS Score:** 5.5 (Medium)
- **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
