Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-15820:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the web application running on the EasyIO 30P controller. Specifically, the `GDN` parameter within the `dev.htm` page is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the `GDN` parameter. This injected code is then stored and executed by the browsers of other users when they access the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the web application.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can steal session tokens or other sensitive information from the browser of a victim.
*   **Malicious Actions:** The attacker could perform malicious actions on behalf of the victim, such as internal network discovery, traffic tunneling, or modifying the controller's settings.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable `dev.htm` page.
*   **Malicious Payload:** The POST request includes a malicious JavaScript payload within the `GDN` parameter (e.g., `...'onMouseOver='alert(1);`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable EasyIO 30P device.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker must know the specific URL of the vulnerable page (`dev.htm`).
*   **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs the ability to craft and send HTTP POST requests with the malicious payload.
