Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-15181:

**CVE Description:**
The official CVE description is missing, so we will rely on the exploit-db description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper input sanitization when setting the SSID and security key of the JioFi 4G M2S router. Specifically, the device is vulnerable to injection of HTML/JavaScript code into the configuration parameters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Lack of input sanitization**: The device's firmware does not sanitize or validate the input provided for SSID and security key fields.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Although not explicitly stated as XSS, the ability to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into these settings indicates a stored XSS vulnerability.
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: By injecting malicious code, a user can cause the router to crash and restart, resulting in a denial of service.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Successful injection of the payload causes the router to restart, disrupting network connectivity.
- **Configuration Reset**: The injected payload can reset or corrupt the device's WiFi settings, specifically the SSID and security key. After exploiting the vulnerability, the router's configuration is changed and the SSID name and security key are blank, requiring manual reconfiguration of WiFi settings. Additionally, users may be forced to use an unsecured wifi network.
- **Persistent Configuration Change**:  The SSID name will be persistently changed to include the injected payload.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web interface of the router.
- An attacker needs to access the router's management interface (typically via a web browser).
- The attacker needs to manipulate the input fields of the WiFi settings page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the target device.
- The attacker needs to know the router's IP address (usually the default gateway) and have credentials to login to the router's web interface.
- The attacker does not need to be an authenticated user if a vulnerability exists that allows for bypassing the router's authentication.

**Additional information:**
- The proof of concept (PoC) provided shows that injecting code like `o<x>nmouseover=alert<x>(1)` into the SSID and security key fields will trigger a crash and restart of the router.
- After the crash and restart, the SSID is changed to include the injected script and the security key is blank. The device does not revert to factory settings.
