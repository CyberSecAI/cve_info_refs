  "vulnerability_details": {
    "Root cause": "The Discuss component for inviting a follower on a document did not properly sanitize the document information when generating the invitation text.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker could inject a malicious document name. By tricking an internal user into inviting them on this document, the attacker could execute arbitrary web script in the victim's browser. This could lead to sensitive data leaks or session takeover.",
    "Attack vector": "Network exploitable.",
    "Attacker capabilities": "No privileged account necessary. The attacker needs to create a document with a crafted name, possibly through contact forms, job forms, or email routes. They also need to use social engineering techniques to trick an internal user into inviting them as a follower.",
     "Affected versions": "Odoo Community 12.0 and earlier, and Odoo Enterprise 12.0 and earlier"
