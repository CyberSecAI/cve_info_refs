Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-15400:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the Cisco Cloud Services Platform 2100.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of proper input validation allows an attacker to inject malicious script code into the web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- A successful exploit could allow the attacker to:
    - Execute arbitrary script code within the context of the web interface.
    - Access sensitive, browser-based information.
    - Potentially perform actions as the victim user within the affected web application.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over a network.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to persuade a user of the web interface to click a malicious link to trigger the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not require any prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to employ social engineering techniques to make a user click a malicious link.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in the web-based management interface of Cisco Cloud Services Platform 2100.
- There are no workarounds available.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was found during internal security testing.
- The CVSS base score is 6.1, with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N.
- This is a stored/persistent XSS as the malicious script is executed when another user interacts with the affected application.
