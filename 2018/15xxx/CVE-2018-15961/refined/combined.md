Priority and Severity rating systems for Security Bulletins

The Adobe Priority Rating System is a guideline to help our customers in managed environments prioritize Adobe security updates. We base our priority rankings on historical attack patterns for the relevant product, the type of vulnerability, the platform(s) affected, and any potential mitigations that are in place.

The definitions of the priority ratings are:

| **Rating** | **Definition** |
| --- | --- |
| **Priority 1** | This update resolves vulnerabilities being targeted, or which have a higher risk of being targeted, by exploit(s) in the wild for a given product version and platform. Adobe recommends administrators install the update as soon as possible. (for example, within 72 hours). |
| **Priority 2** | This update resolves vulnerabilities in a product that has historically been at elevated risk. There are currently no known exploits. Based on previous experience, we do not anticipate exploits are imminent. As a best practice, Adobe recommends administrators install the update soon (for example, within 30 days). |
| **Priority 3** | This update resolves vulnerabilities in a product that has historically not been a target for attackers. Adobe recommends administrators install the update at their discretion. |

The Adobe Severity Rating System is a guideline to help our customers assess the security impact of known software vulnerabilities.

The definitions of the severity ratings are:

| **Rating** | **Definition** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical** | A vulnerability, which, if exploited would allow malicious native-code to execute, potentially without a user being aware. |
| **Important** | A vulnerability, which, if exploited would compromise data security, potentially allowing access to confidential data, or could compromise processing resources. |
| **Moderate** | A vulnerability that is limited to a significant degree by factors such as default configuration, auditing, or is difficult to exploit. |

### Summary

Adobe has released security updates for ColdFusion versions 2018, 2016 and 11. These updates resolve [critical](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/severity-ratings.html) vulnerabilities that could lead to arbitrary code execution.

UPDATE: As of September 28, Adobe is aware of a report that CVE-2018-15961 is being actively exploited in the wild. The updates for ColdFusion 2018 and ColdFusion 2016 announced in this bulletin have been elevated to Priority 1. Adobe recommends customers update to the latest version as soon as possible.

### Affected Versions

| **Product** | **Affected Versions** | **Platform** |
| --- | --- | --- |

| ColdFusion (2016 release) | Update 6 and earlier versions | All |
| ColdFusion 11 | Update 14 and earlier versions | All |

### Solution

Adobe categorizes these updates with the following [priority rating](/security/severity-ratings.html) and recommends users update their installations to the newest versions:

| **Product** | **Updated Version** | **Platform** | **Priority rating** | **Availability** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ColdFusion 2018 | Update 1 | All | 1 | [Tech note](https://helpx.adobe.com/coldfusion/kb/coldfusion-2018-update-1.html) |
| ColdFusion 2016 | Update 7 | All | 1 | [Tech note](https://helpx.adobe.com/coldfusion/kb/coldfusion-2016-update-7.html) |

### ColdFusion JDK Requirement

**COLDFUSION 2018 HF1**

**For Application Servers**

On JEE installations, set the following JVM flag, "-Djdk.serialFilter= !org.mozilla.\*\*;!com.sun.syndication.\*\*;!org.apache.commons.beanutils.\*\*", in the respective startup file depending on the type of Application Server being used.

For example:

Apache Tomcat Application Server: edit JAVA\_OPTS in the ‘Catalina.bat/sh’ file

WebLogic Application Server:  edit JAVA\_OPTIONS in the ‘startWeblogic.cmd’ file

WildFly/EAP Application Server:  edit JAVA\_OPTS in the ‘standalone.conf’ file

Set the JVM flags on a JEE installation of ColdFusion, not on a standalone installation.

**COLDFUSION 2016 HF7**

This security update requires ColdFusion to be on JDK 8u121 or higher.   Adobe recommends that you must manually update your ColdFusion JDK/JRE to the latest version. In case you do not update the JDK/JRE, simply applying the update would NOT secure the server.

**For Application Servers**

Additionally, on JEE installations, set the following JVM flag, "-Djdk.serialFilter= !org.mozilla.\*\*;!com.sun.syndication.\*\*;!org.apache.commons.beanutils.\*\*", in the respective startup file depending on the type of Application Server being used.

For example:

On Apache Tomcat Application Server, edit JAVA\_OPTS in the ‘Catalina.bat/sh’ file

On WebLogic Application Server, edit JAVA\_OPTIONS in the ‘startWeblogic.cmd’ file

On a WildFly/EAP Application Server, edit JAVA\_OPTS in the ‘standalone.conf’ file

Set the JVM flags on a JEE installation of ColdFusion, not on a standalone installation

**COLDFUSION 11 HF15**

This security update requires ColdFusion to be on JDK 7u131 or JDK 8u121 or higher.   Adobe recommends that you must manually update your ColdFusion JDK/JRE to the latest version. In case you do not update the JDK/JRE, simply applying the update would NOT secure the server.

**For Application Servers**

Additionally, on J2EE installations, set the following JVM flag, "-Djdk.serialFilter= !org.mozilla.\*\*;!com.sun.syndication.\*\*;!org.apache.commons.beanutils.\*\*", in the respective startup file depending on the type of Application Server being used.

For example:

On Apache Tomcat Application Server, edit JAVA\_OPTS in the ‘Catalina.bat/sh’ file

On WebLogic Application Server, edit JAVA\_OPTIONS in the ‘startWeblogic.cmd’ file

On a WildFly/EAP Application Server, edit JAVA\_OPTS in the ‘standalone.conf’ file

Set the JVM flags on a JEE installation of ColdFusion, not on a standalone installation

### Revisions

September 28, 2018: Updates for ColdFusion 2018 and ColdFusion 2016 have been elevated to Priority 1 due to a report that CVE-2018-15961 is now being actively exploited.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
