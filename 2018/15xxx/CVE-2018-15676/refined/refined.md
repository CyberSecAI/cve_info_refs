The provided content contains information about multiple vulnerabilities in XBTIT Torrent Tracker software, including CVE-2018-15676.

**CVE-2018-15676: Anti-XSS Mechanism Bypass**

*   **Root Cause:** The application implements a basic anti-XSS filter in `includes/crk_protection.php` that blocks requests containing certain string signatures. However, this filter can be bypassed by using string manipulation techniques to reconstruct the blocked strings.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Inadequate input sanitization and filtering. The filter can be bypassed through string manipulation (`String.replace` and `slice`).
    *   The application fails to prevent the use of `eval` function.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can be used to steal cookies, including session cookies, or perform other malicious actions.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   By crafting a specific payload with string manipulation, an attacker can bypass the anti-XSS filter. The payload uses `String.replace` to break up recognized strings and then reconstruct them, avoiding detection. The use of `eval` allows the constructed string to be executed as JavaScript.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to send crafted requests to the XBTIT application.
    *   Knowledge of the anti-XSS filter implementation and techniques to bypass it.

The content also details other vulnerabilities which are not related to CVE-2018-15676 but are still part of the same security audit:
*   **Reflected XSS in Forum Search (CVE-2018-15679):** Reflected XSS via the `keywords` parameter in the forum search functionality. The XSS payload is delivered through the search query.
*   **Reflected XSS in User Signup (CVE-2018-15678):** Reflected XSS via the `act` parameter in the signup page. The XSS payload is delivered through the signup form parameters.
*   **Stored XSS via CSRF in News (CVE-2018-15677):** Stored XSS vulnerability due to lack of CSRF protection when posting news and inadequate input sanitization of the news title.
*    **Reflected XSS in News Edit Page (CVE-2018-16361):** Reflected XSS via the `id` parameter in the news edit page. The vulnerability is present because the application doesn't sanitize the news ID before displaying the edit page.
*    **Passwords Stored as Unsalted MD5 Hashes (CVE-2018-15680):** User passwords stored as unsalted MD5 hashes, making them vulnerable to rainbow table attacks.
*   **Password Hash Stored in Cookie (CVE-2018-15681):**  The application stores a modified MD5 hash of the password in a cookie, using a predictable random number. This allows for the recovery of the user's password.
*   **Private Message CSRF (CVE-2018-15682):** Lack of CSRF protection when sending private messages, allowing an attacker to send messages on behalf of an authenticated user.
*   **Unauthenticated Access to PHP Logs (CVE-2018-15684):** PHP error logs are publicly accessible due to the lack of an index file in the log directory and predictable log file names.
*   **Open Redirect in Login Page (CVE-2018-15683):** The `returnto` parameter in the login page allows for open redirection.
