We could try this.. I know nothing about FLIRT, initially I also tried to fix this issue by allocating enough bytes, but it didn't work well.

I have the feeling we parse other things wrongly already...

So overall, ok for this change.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Because at <https://github.com/radare/radare2/pull/11300/files#diff-a7c93b8aab99f805c93479a733cb7decR810> you would end up writing to `name[R_FLIRT_NAME_MAX]`, which is an array of R\_FLIRT\_NAME\_MAX bytes, so you would overflow one byte.

Sorry, something went wrong.
