Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2018-15710:

**CVE-2018-15710: Nagios XI 5.5.6 Local Privilege Escalation**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw in the `autodiscover_new.php` script combined with the fact that this script can be executed with root privileges via `sudo` without requiring a password due to entries in `/etc/sudoers`.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Command Injection:** The `autodiscover_new.php` script takes user-supplied input (specifically the 'addresses' parameter) and incorporates it into a system command without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands into the executed command.
    *   **Insecure Sudo Configuration:** The `/etc/sudoers` file allows the `nagios` and `apache` users to execute the `autodiscover_new.php` script with `sudo` privileges without a password prompt, effectively granting them root access if the script is vulnerable.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A local, authenticated attacker can escalate their privileges to root. This allows them to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Local access to the server is required.
    *   The attacker must be able to execute commands as either the `nagios` or `apache` user.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to execute commands as either the `nagios` or `apache` user.

**Additional Information from the provided content:**
* The vulnerability exists in Nagios XI versions from 2012r1.0 to 5.5.6
* The `autodiscover_new.php` script is protected by SourceGuardian which makes static analysis difficult. However, dynamic analysis confirms the command injection.
