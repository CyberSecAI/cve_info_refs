The provided content describes two Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the `portfolioCMS` application.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **CSRF vulnerability in `admin/portfolio.php?newpage=true`:** This allows an attacker to create new pages on the website.
2.  **CSRF vulnerability in `admin/aboutus.php`:** This allows an attacker to update website settings.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can:
* Create arbitrary new pages on the website, potentially injecting malicious content.
* Modify website settings, leading to defacement or other unwanted changes.

**Attack vectors:**
* The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page (provided as `one.html` and `two.html` in the content).
* The victim, an authenticated user of the `portfolioCMS` application, is tricked into visiting the malicious page.
* The malicious page sends a forged request to the vulnerable `portfolioCMS` endpoints, leveraging the victim's authenticated session.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to host and deliver the malicious HTML page to a logged-in user of the vulnerable application.
* No special permissions within the application are needed as the attacker is leveraging the session of an authenticated user.
