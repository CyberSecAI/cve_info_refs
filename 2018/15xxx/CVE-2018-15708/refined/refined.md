Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-15708:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies within the `Snoopy` library, specifically in the `_httpsrequest()` method. This method constructs a command to be executed using the `exec()` function, which includes the `curl` utility to make HTTP requests. 
- The `escapeshellcmd()` function is used incorrectly, as it is applied to individual parts of the command instead of the entire command string.
- This incorrect usage allows an attacker to inject arbitrary arguments into the `curl` command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Command Injection:** Due to the flawed use of `escapeshellcmd()`, attackers can inject arbitrary command-line arguments into the `curl` command executed by the `exec()` function.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The `magpie_debug.php` script fetches a URL from the `url` parameter of a GET request without any validation.
- **Insecure HTTP Client:** The `Snoopy` library's `fetch()` and `_httpsrequest()` methods are vulnerable.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerable `magpie_debug.php` script can be accessed without any prior authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By injecting the `-o` argument into the curl command, an attacker can write the response of a crafted HTTP request to an arbitrary file on the server. If the attacker injects malicious PHP code to a publicly accessible location, they can execute arbitrary PHP commands on the server by accessing that file via a web browser.
- **Privilege Escalation:** When combined with a local privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2018-15710), an attacker can obtain root access to the system.
- **Full System Compromise:** By combining the remote code execution vulnerability with the privilege escalation, an attacker can gain complete control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP GET Request:** A specially crafted HTTP GET request to `magpie_debug.php` with a malicious URL.
- **Exploitation of Snoopy library:** The vulnerable code is present in the `Snoopy` library used by `magpie_debug.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target Nagios XI server.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
- **HTTPS Listener:** The attacker needs to set up an HTTPS server to serve malicious PHP code to the vulnerable system.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerable `magpie_debug.php` script is located at `/nagiosxi/includes/dashlets/rss_dashlet/magpierss/scripts/magpie_debug.php`.
- An attacker can use the `-o` argument of `curl` to write the output of an HTTP request to an arbitrary file location, such as `/usr/local/nagvis/share/`.
- The vulnerability exists because the `escapeshellcmd()` function was used incorrectly. The correct function to use in this case is `escapeshellarg()`.
- The provided exploit code attempts to write a PHP file using the curl command injection, and then attempts a local privilege escalation using a different vulnerability to gain a root shell.
- The article also mentions that the vulnerability is present in Nagios XI versions up to 5.5.6, and was patched in 5.5.7.
- The vulnerability was found in the `MagpieRSS` library, which uses a vulnerable version of `Snoopy`.
