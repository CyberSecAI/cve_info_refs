- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple pages in Avaya AuraÂ® Orchestration Designer are vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Malicious content can be returned to the user. The CVSS v3 score indicates high impact, including high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks (AV:N) exploiting user interaction (UI:R).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any privileges (PR:N) and needs to trick a user into clicking on a malicious link, which indicates user interaction is required (UI:R), and the vulnerability is exploitable over a network (AV:N). The scope of the vulnerability is changed, as the vulnerability can affect other components within the application (S:C).
