Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-15664:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The provided content directly references CVE-2018-15664 and describes the vulnerability, therefore it is **RELEVANT.**

**2. Vulnerability details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause of the vulnerability is a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition within the `FollowSymlinkInScope` function in Docker. This function resolves symlinks within a container's scope, but the resolved path can be manipulated after the check but before the path is used.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **TOCTOU Race Condition:** The primary weakness is the race condition. The path resolution in `FollowSymlinkInScope` is not atomic, allowing an attacker to change symlinks after the path is checked but before the path is used in a different operation.
    *   **Inadequate Path Validation:** Docker does not use `O_PATH` file descriptors or perform sufficient checks to validate paths to prevent symlink-exchange attacks.
    *   **Lack of Chroot to Container Root:** Docker's `chrootarchive` mechanism `chroot`s into the parent directory of the archive target, which is attacker-controlled, instead of chrooting into the container's root directory, exacerbating the exploit.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary File Read/Write:** A successful attack allows a malicious container to gain read and write access to the host filesystem with root privileges. This allows exfiltration of sensitive information from the host, or modification to any files the user has access to.
    *   **System Compromise:** Because of the potential for arbitrary file read/write and root access on the host, this is a system compromise vulnerability.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **`docker cp` command:** The vulnerability is directly exploitable through the `docker cp` command. This command allows users to copy files to and from a container, triggering the vulnerable code paths in `FollowSymlinkInScope`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Compromised Container:** The attacker must have already gained some level of access to a container.
    *   **Timing:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate symlinks within the container's filesystem during the narrow race window between path resolution and when that path is actually used. This requires a degree of control over the container's filesystem.
    *   **Privileged user interaction:**  The attack also needs a privileged user to execute a `docker cp` command to trigger the vulnerability.

**3. Additional Details (beyond the CVE description):**

*   **Exploitability:** The provided descriptions details how the race condition can be triggered.  The attack can be made more reliable by manipulating symlinks quickly. One exploit script involves using RENAME_EXCHANGE in a loop.  The `run_write.sh` exploit is more reliable than `run_read.sh`.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   **Pausing Containers:** A temporary mitigation strategy is to pause containers during filesystem operations (such as `docker cp`). This method can impact the container's availability and might not work on rootless Docker setups. The implementation of this fix is detailed in the provided GitHub pull request information.
    *   **`chrootarchive` fix:** A more comprehensive fix involves modifying `chrootarchive` to `chroot` into the container root directory instead of the parent directory, which is attacker-controlled in the container, or to use  `O_PATH` file descriptors.
    *   **Kernel functionality:**  The content details future work for Linux kernel patches that would add the ability to safely resolve paths within a rootfs, but is not in place at the time of the advisory and would be difficult to implement in docker.
*   **Red Hat Specifics**: Red Hat rated this as a "Moderate" security issue. Their advisory (RHSA-2019:1910) includes fixes for the TOCTOU vulnerability. Red Hat recommends stopping containers prior to copying files to avoid the vulnerability.
*   **SUSE Specifics:** SUSE Bugzilla entries show the vulnerability and provide descriptions from the original discoverer. Their fix is similar to the solution implemented in Red Hat.

**4.  Key Takeaways:**

*   This is a classic TOCTOU race condition, which is hard to fix.
*   The race is exploitable by a malicious user inside a docker container.
*   A system administrator using `docker cp` will trigger the vulnerability.
*   The impact of successful exploitation is arbitrary file read/write on the host machine with root privileges.

In summary, CVE-2018-15664 is a significant vulnerability in Docker's `docker cp` command. The core issue is a TOCTOU race condition in path resolution and a lack of proper filesystem operation within a secure context, that can be exploited by a compromised container leading to host file access.  The content also points to the more secure implementation with `O_PATH` handles as a preferred long term solution, also described in [filepath-securejoin](https://github.com/cyphar/filepath-securejoin) project.
