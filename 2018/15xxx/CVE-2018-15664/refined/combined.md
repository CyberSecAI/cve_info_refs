[![Build Status](https://github.com/cyphar/filepath-securejoin/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cyphar/filepath-securejoin/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

### Old API

This library was originally just an implementation of `SecureJoin` which was
[intended to be included in the Go standard library](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/20126) as a safer
`filepath.Join` that would restrict the path lookup to be inside a root
directory.

The implementation was based on code that existed in several container
runtimes. Unfortunately, this API is **fundamentally unsafe** against attackers
that can modify path components after `SecureJoin` returns and before the
caller uses the path, allowing for some fairly trivial TOCTOU attacks.

`SecureJoin` (and `SecureJoinVFS`) are still provided by this library to
support legacy users, but new users are strongly suggested to avoid using
`SecureJoin` and instead use the [new api](#new-api) or switch to
[libpathrs](https://github.com/openSUSE/libpathrs).

With the above limitations in mind, this library guarantees the following:

* If no error is set, the resulting string **must** be a child path of
  `root` and will not contain any symlink path components (they will all be
  expanded).
* When expanding symlinks, all symlink path components **must** be resolved
  relative to the provided root. In particular, this can be considered a
  userspace implementation of how `chroot(2)` operates on file paths. Note that
  these symlinks will **not** be expanded lexically (`filepath.Clean` is not
  called on the input before processing).
* Non-existent path components are unaffected by `SecureJoin` (similar to
  `filepath.EvalSymlinks`'s semantics).
* The returned path will always be `filepath.Clean`ed and thus not contain any
  `..` components.

A (trivial) implementation of this function on GNU/Linux systems could be done
with the following (note that this requires root privileges and is far more
opaque than the implementation in this library, and also requires that
`readlink` is inside the `root` path and is trustworthy):

```
package securejoin

import (
	"os/exec"
	"path/filepath"
)

func SecureJoin(root, unsafePath string) (string, error) {
	unsafePath = string(filepath.Separator) + unsafePath
	cmd := exec.Command("chroot", root,
		"readlink", "--canonicalize-missing", "--no-newline", unsafePath)
	output, err := cmd.CombinedOutput()
	if err != nil {
		return "", err
	}
	expanded := string(output)
	return filepath.Join(root, expanded), nil
}
```

### New API

While we recommend users switch to [libpathrs](https://github.com/openSUSE/libpathrs) as soon as it has a
stable release, some methods implemented by libpathrs have been ported to this
library to ease the transition. These APIs are only supported on Linux.

These APIs are implemented such that `filepath-securejoin` will
opportunistically use certain newer kernel APIs that make these operations far
more secure. In particular:

* All of the lookup operations will use [`openat2`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/openat2.2.html) on new enough
  kernels (Linux 5.6 or later) to restrict lookups through magic-links and
  bind-mounts (for certain operations) and to make use of `RESOLVE_IN_ROOT` to
  efficiently resolve symlinks within a rootfs.
* The APIs provide hardening against a malicious `/proc` mount to either detect
  or avoid being tricked by a `/proc` that is not legitimate. This is done
  using [`openat2`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/openat2.2.html) for all users, and privileged users will also be
  further protected by using [`fsopen`](https://github.com/brauner/man-pages-md/blob/main/fsopen.md) and [`open_tree`](https://github.com/brauner/man-pages-md/blob/main/open_tree.md)
  (Linux 5.2 or later).

#### `OpenInRoot`

```
func OpenInRoot(root, unsafePath string) (*os.File, error)
func OpenatInRoot(root *os.File, unsafePath string) (*os.File, error)
func Reopen(handle *os.File, flags int) (*os.File, error)
```

`OpenInRoot` is a much safer version of

```
path, err := securejoin.SecureJoin(root, unsafePath)
file, err := os.OpenFile(path, unix.O_PATH|unix.O_CLOEXEC)
```

that protects against various race attacks that could lead to serious security
issues, depending on the application. Note that the returned `*os.File` is an
`O_PATH` file descriptor, which is quite restricted. Callers will probably need
to use `Reopen` to get a more usable handle (this split is done to provide
useful features like PTY spawning and to avoid users accidentally opening bad
inodes that could cause a DoS).

Callers need to be careful in how they use the returned `*os.File`. Usually it
is only safe to operate on the handle directly, and it is very easy to create a
security issue. [libpathrs](https://github.com/openSUSE/libpathrs) provides far more helpers to make using
these handles safer -- there is currently no plan to port them to
`filepath-securejoin`.

`OpenatInRoot` is like `OpenInRoot` except that the root is provided using an
`*os.File`. This allows you to ensure that multiple `OpenatInRoot` (or
`MkdirAllHandle`) calls are operating on the same rootfs.

> **NOTE**: Unlike `SecureJoin`, `OpenInRoot` will error out as soon as it hits
> a dangling symlink or non-existent path. This is in contrast to `SecureJoin`
> which treated non-existent components as though they were real directories,
> and would allow for partial resolution of dangling symlinks. These behaviours
> are at odds with how Linux treats non-existent paths and dangling symlinks,
> and so these are no longer allowed.

#### `MkdirAll`

```
func MkdirAll(root, unsafePath string, mode int) error
func MkdirAllHandle(root *os.File, unsafePath string, mode int) (*os.File, error)
```

`MkdirAll` is a much safer version of

```
path, err := securejoin.SecureJoin(root, unsafePath)
err = os.MkdirAll(path, mode)
```

that protects against the same kinds of races that `OpenInRoot` protects
against.

`MkdirAllHandle` is like `MkdirAll` except that the root is provided using an
`*os.File` (the reason for this is the same as with `OpenatInRoot`) and an
`*os.File` of the final created directory is returned (this directory is
guaranteed to be effectively identical to the directory created by
`MkdirAllHandle`, which is not possible to ensure by just using `OpenatInRoot`
after `MkdirAll`).

> **NOTE**: Unlike `SecureJoin`, `MkdirAll` will error out as soon as it hits
> a dangling symlink or non-existent path. This is in contrast to `SecureJoin`

**********************************************************************
There is no released Docker version with a fix for this issue at the time of writing. I've submitted a patch upstream[1] which is still undergoing code review, and after discussion with them they agreed that public disclosure of the issue was reasonable. Since the SUSE bug report contains exploit scripts[2], I've attached them here too.

This attack was discovered by myself (Aleksa Sarai), though Tõnis Tiigi did mention the possibility of an attack like this in the past (at the time we thought the race window was to small to exploit). In addition, you could see this exploit as a continuation of some 'docker cp'
security bugs that I helped find and fix more than 4 years ago in 2014[3,4] (these were never assigned CVEs because at the time it was thought that attacks which used access to docker.sock were not valid security bugs).

[[ Overview ]]

The basic premise of this attack is that FollowSymlinkInScope suffers from a fairly fundamental TOCTOU attack. The purpose of FollowSymlinkInScope is to take a given path and safely resolve it as though the process was inside the container. After the full path has been resolved, the resolved path is passed around a bit and then operated on a bit later (in the case of 'docker cp' it is opened when creating the archive that is streamed to the client). If an attacker can add a symlink component to the path *after* the resolution but *before* it is operated on, then you could end up resolving the symlink path component on the host as root. In the case of 'docker cp' this gives you read *and* write access to any path on the host.

As far as I'm aware there are no meaningful protections against this kind of attack (other than not allowing "docker cp" on running containers -- but that only helps with his particular attack through FollowSymlinkInScope). Unless you have restricted the Docker daemon through AppArmor, then it can affect the host filesystem -- I haven't verified if the issue is as exploitable under the default SELinux configuration on Fedora/CentOS/RHEL.

[[ Exploit Scripts ]]

Attacked are two reproducers of the issue. They both include a Docker image which contains a simple binary that does a RENAME_EXCHANGE of a symlink to "/" and an empty directory in a loop, hoping to hit the race condition. In both of the scripts, the user is trying to copy a file to or from a path containing the swapped symlink.

In the case of run_read.sh, I get a <1% chance of hitting the race condition (my attack script is quite dumb, it's possible with better timing you'd be able to hit the race window much more effectively).
However <1% still means it only takes 10s of trying to get read access to the host with root permissions.

  % ./run_read.sh &>/dev/null & ; sleep 10s ; pkill -9 run.sh
  % chmod 0644 ex*/out # to fix up permissions for grep
  % grep 'SUCCESS' ex*/out | wc -l # managed to get it from the host
  2
  % grep 'FAILED'  ex*/out | wc -l # got the file from the container
  334

However, the run_write.sh script can overwrite the host filesystem in very few iterations -- this is because internally Docker has a "chrootarchive" concept where the archive is extracted from within a chroot. However, Docker doesn't chroot into the container's "/" (which would make this exploit ineffective), it chroots into the parent directory of the archive target -- which is attacker controlled. As a result, this actually results in the attack being more likely to succeed (once the chroot has hit the race, the rest of the attack is guaranteed to succeed).

The scripts will ask for sudo permissions, but that is only to be able to create a "flag file" in /. You could modify the scripts to target /etc/shadow instead if you like.

[[ Future Work ]]

In an attempt to come up with a better solution for this problem, I've been working on some Linux kernel patches which add the ability to safely resolve paths from within a rootfs[5]. But they are still being reviewed and it will take a while for userspace to be able to take advantage of the new interfaces. However, I am also working on redesigning my "secure join" library's API[6] so that we can at least better detect these attacks on older kernels and take advantage of [5] in newer kernels.

System calls like [openat()](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html)
have access to the entire filesystem —
or, at least, that part of the filesystem that exists in the current mount
namespace and which the caller has the
permission to access. There are times, though, when it is desirable to
reduce that access, usually for reasons of security; that has proved to be
especially true in many container use cases. A new [patch
set](/ml/linux-kernel/20180929103453.12025-1-cyphar%40cyphar.com/) from Aleksa Sarai has revived an old idea: provide a set of
AT\_ flags that can be used to control the scope of a given
pathname lookup operation.

There have been previous attempts at restricting pathname lookup, but none
of them have been merged thus far. David Drysdale [posted an O\_BENEATH option](/Articles/619146/) to
openat() in 2014 that would require the eventual target to be
underneath the starting directory (as provided to openat()) in the
filesystem hierarchy. More
recently, Al Viro suggested [AT\_NO\_JUMPS](/Articles/723057/) as a way of preventing
lookups from venturing outside of the current directory hierarchy or the
starting directory's mount point. Both ideas have attracted interest, but
neither has yet been pushed long or hard enough to make it into the
mainline.

Sarai's venture into this territory takes the form of several new
AT\_ flags that can be used with system calls like
openat():

* AT\_BENEATH would, similar to O\_BENEATH, prevent
  the pathname lookup from moving above the starting point in the
  filesystem hierarchy. So, as a simple example, an attempt to open
  ../foo would be blocked. This option *does* allow the
  use of ".." in a pathname as long as the result remains below
  the starting point, though, so opening foo/../bar would
  work.* AT\_XDEV prevents the lookup from crossing a mount-point
    boundary in either the upward or downward direction.* AT\_NO\_PROCLINK prevents the following of symbolic links found
      in the /proc hierarchy; in particular, it is aimed at the
      links found under fd/ in any specific process's directory.* AT\_NO\_SYMLINK prevents following any symbolic links at all,
        including those blocked by AT\_NO\_PROCLINK.* AT\_THIS\_ROOT performs the equivalent of a [chroot()](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/chroot.2.html)
          call (to the starting directory) prior to the beginning of pathname
          lookup. This option, too, is meant to constrain lookups to the given
          directory hierarchy; it will also change how absolute symbolic links
          are interpreted.

There are numerous use cases for these new flags, but the driving
force this time around would appear to be container workloads and, in
particular, runtime systems for containers. Those systems often
have to look
inside a container and, perhaps, act on files within a container's
directory hierarchy. If the container itself is compromised or otherwise
malicious, it can attempt to play games with its filesystems to confuse the
runtime system and gain access to the host.

This posting got a reception that was positive overall, but with a number
of concerns about the details. For example, Jann Horn [liked
AT\_BENEATH](/ml/linux-kernel/CAG48ez17EQuJQAZUg5hDFXhkjnnVFh39%3DaD%2Bj0FBdsoTONSGEA%40mail.gmail.com/), but would rather that it forbade the use of
".." entirely, even if the result remains beneath the starting
point. Doing so would help to block exploitation of various types of
directory-traversal bugs, he said. Sarai [responded](/ml/linux-kernel/20181001160431.emb6b2hf32b754cl%40ryuk/)
that 37% of all the symbolic links on his system contained "..";
"this indicates to me that you would be restricting a large amount of
reasonable resolutions because of this restriction". That said, he
indicated a willingness to change the behavior if need be.

Horn also [complained](/ml/linux-kernel/CAG48ez30WJhbsro2HOc_DR7V91M%2BhNFzBP5ogRMZaxbAORvqzg%40mail.gmail.com/)
about the "footgun potential" of AT\_THIS\_ROOT which,
he said, shares all of the security failings of chroot(). He
described a scenario where a hostile container could force an escape by
moving directories around: "If the root of your walk is below an
attacker-controlled directory, this of course means that you lose
instantly". A possible mitigation here would be to require the
starting directory in AT\_THIS\_ROOT lookups to be a mount point;
Sarai was [amenable](/ml/linux-kernel/20181001054246.gfinmx3api7kjhmc%40ryuk/)
to making this change as well.

Horn, along with [Andy
Lutomirski](/ml/linux-kernel/F0E08B90-F10B-4897-913D-CA18E99A987D%40amacapital.net/), questioned the container-management use case; as Lutomirski
put it: "Any sane container is based on
pivot\_root or similar, so the runtime can just do the walk in the container
context". In this particular case, it [turns
out](/ml/linux-kernel/20181001054246.gfinmx3api7kjhmc%40ryuk/) that part of the problem is the result of the fact that the
container runtime in question is written in Go:

You're right about this -- for C runtimes. In Go we cannot do a raw
clone() or fork() (if you do it manually with RawSyscall you'll end
with broken runtime state). So you're forced to do fork+exec (which
then means that you can't use CLONE\_FILES and must use
SCM\_RIGHTS). Same goes for CLONE\_VFORK.

Since the system cannot use the relatively cheap ways to get into a
container's context, it has to use an expensive workaround instead; this
expense could be avoided if files could be opened with the new
AT\_ flags. Lutomirski [responded](/ml/linux-kernel/C89D720F-3CC4-4FA9-9CBB-E41A67360A6B%40amacapital.net/)
that he is "not very sympathetic to the argument that 'Go's
runtime model is incompatible with the simpler solution'". He
proposed an alternative that might work in this setting without adding the
new flags.

That alternative might work, but the fact remains that there are other use
cases for restricting the scope of pathname lookups; that is why the idea
continues to pop up on the kernel's mailing lists. And Lutomirski, too, [agreed](/ml/linux-kernel/1EE20CA2-4C8B-4A80-B613-0277D92B376D%40amacapital.net/)
that some of the flags seem useful. Whether this implementation will be
the one that manages to go all the way to the mainline remains to be seen,
but it seems likely that, one of these years, the kernel will gain the
ability to control lookups in a way similar to the one that has been
proposed here.

I don't understand why the Go team is so resistant to adding the ability to explicitly pin a goroutine to a machine thread. Goroutines are an amazing, almost ideal construct. But there's a very obvious and unresolvable impedance mismatch between how a goroutine implement threading (linear flow of logical execution) and how traditional operating systems do. A similar mismatch exists with FFI ABIs (i.e. stack details) and with the blocking semantics of some syscalls. In those cases a goroutine \*is\* pinned to a machine thread; indeed, the very architecture of the Go runtime (the [G]oroutine, OS [M]achine thread, and [P]rocessor scheduling abstractions) is built around this mismatch. It's inexplicable to me why they refuse to expose the scheduling levers that must necessarily exist.

You can pin a goroutine to a thread using LockOSThread, but it basically locks this thread out of running other goroutines.

(Personally, I'd like for them to add goroutine IDs)

That wouldn't have helped anyway: the problem with not being able to do the classic fork+exec in Go programs is that the code executing in each of them heavily relies on the live Go runtime (which is linked with/into any compiled Go executable and actually manages the whole lifecycle of the program), and that runtime exploits multiple OS threads — both to run the program's goroutines and do its own chores.

Since fork() clones the state of just a single thread — the one which happened to execute that syscall, — as soon as the control resumes in the child process, there is literally no Go runtime anymore around the goroutine "awoken" in the cloned thread, and as soon as it happens to call anything which would normally reach for the runtime, it is hosed. And normally such a call would happen pretty soon.

So basically the only sensible thing one might safely do after forking a process running a Go program is to do a controlled set of preparations and exec().

And actually that's what the syscall.ForkExec does — with some added complexity stemming from Go having an execution model other than C ;-)

You can look at ForkExec in <https://golang.org/src/syscall/exec_unix.go> and then at forkAndExecInChild in <https://golang.org/src/syscall/exec_linux.go> — the code is very easy to follow for any programmer with a C background, and it is extensively commented.

Shouldn't it be possible to quiesce the runtime (pause GC, park all other goroutines, and join all kernel threads)? All the machinery in the scheduler must already be there, more or less. Maybe some component is currently running in a dedicated thread in an infinite loop, but conceptually it could be refactored to be able to enter and exit its core loop.

It might not be particularly efficient and come with a ton of gotchas, but it would at least make some currently impossible things possible, such as using geteuid and forking helper processes. Those things tend to happen early on, anyhow, so performance and other limitations wouldn't matter much.

Surely this could be vastly simplified by allowing an eBPF program to be attached to a file descriptor so that when a path\_lookup starts from that file descriptor, the eBPF program is used to vet or modify the lookup of each component.

I hope so. I've just spent a day debugging a eBPF filter written by somebody else and it's NOT a nice experience at all.

eBPF is a nice thing to have if machine-generated (it's a rather nice and orthogonal assembler, and the ability to add helpers is just a killer feature that I wish real assemblers had!), but it's about as pleasant to debug programs written in it as any other assembler: i.e. fairly easy if you're familiar with the code generator, a nightmare otherwise, doubly so if this is the less regular land of handwritten code, disassembled and devoid of comments.

It's way worse than assembly. With assembly you can typically use debuggers to trace the execution and inspect the environment. Nothing comparable exists for eBPF.

Generally I do the same thing when debugging eBPF that I do when debugging other programs: printf()! In the case of eBPF you throw in a helper that does a printk() and chuck in calls to the helper liberally. (This is not so useful if you can't modify the eBPF, mind you.)

It would be “simple” in the sense that getting the eBPF right would be at least as difficult as getting the kernel code with the AT flags right would be. But with eBPF, no one would ever review it carefully or fix the bugs.

eBPF is flexible, but it’s not magic.

openat() is one of those Linux system calls whose rationale I don't quite understand. It allows opening files relative to a particular directory, but can't you do the same thing by manipulating the path name, or by using chdir() first?

Others have commented on the problems with chdir(). The problem with using long absolute pathnames is twofold: firstly, you race with people modifying symlinks and/or renaming out from underneath you (\*at() can at least reduce this by nailing the walk to specific directory inodes). Secondly, the length of pathnames is capped at pathconf(..., \_SC\_PATH\_MAX): but you can make directory trees of arbitrary depth, with absolute paths much deeper than this and indeed deeper than the hardware page size. Nobody does this manually, but it can and does happen with machine-generated hierarchies, and the deep parts of such hierarchies are \*only\* traversable via chdir() or the \*at() syscalls: while you can compose an absolute path that should reach those parts, the kernel will reject it with -ENAMETOOLONG.

So generic code has no choice but to use chdir() or \*at() to traverse hierarchies or fail on such deep hierarchies, and generic multithreaded code or library code which might be run in multithreaded contexts has no choice but to use \*at().

Manipulating pathnames means "doing string operations", something that's fairly cumbersome in C. For an example, consider the following toy-program:
```

#define _GNU_SOURCE

#include <dirent.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>

static char *cwd[] = {
    ".",
    NULL
};

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    DIR *dir;
    struct dirent *d_ent;
    struct stat st;
    int dirfd, rc;

    ++argv;
    if (!*argv) argv = cwd;
    do {
        dirfd = open(*argv, O_RDONLY, 0);
        if (dirfd == -1) {
            perror("open");
            continue;
        }

        dir = fdopendir(dirfd);
        if (!dir) {
            perror("fdopendir");
            continue;
        }

        printf("-----\nfiles in %s\n-----\n", *argv);
        while ((d_ent = readdir(dir))) {
            rc = fstatat(dirfd, d_ent->d_name, &, 0);
            if (rc == -1) {
                if (errno != ENOENT) perror("fstatat");
                continue;
            }

            if (S_ISREG(st.st_mode))
                printf("%s\t\t%zu bytes\n", d_ent->d_name, (size_t)st.st_size);
        }

        closedir(dir);
    } while (*++argv);

    return 0;
}

```
This takes a list of directory pathnames as arguments and prints the names and sizes of all files in any of the directories. It uses *fstatat* because the names returned by *readdir* are filenames relative to the directory being read. Thanks to the *\*at*-call, they can be accessed without doing dynamic string manipulation and buffer management and also without changing the cwd of the process forward and backward for each directory.

Also, *chdir* is basically unusable in multi-threaded processes as it changes the working directory of the process, ie, it affects all threads, not just the one executing it **and**, as seen by another thread, the cwd change is an unpredictable, asynchronously occuring event. Eg, a thread desiring to create two files in the same directory might end up creating them in different directories.

Lastly, the directory a process was started in might have been picked intentionally, eg, as location where core dumps should go to, and the process shouldn't change it except if there's a very good reason for that (and this should be documented).

It’s not just containers. Path-traversal bugs are a common exploit in archivers like tar or unzip, where unpacking a malicious archive file overwrites things elsewhere in the filesystem. I imagine web servers might also use this flag as an additional defence to make sure they only serve content from the right directory. If the flag existed on all operating systems, a lot of userspace path sanitizing code could be removed.

Also, userspace sanitation depends on the fact that no second thread exists that modifies the sanitized path before it's passed to the kernel. In-kernel defenses against that sort of thing at least work.

### New AT\_ flags for restricting pathname lookup

It is quite unfortunate that kernel developers insist on extending openat() with more and more contrived semantics, I wish they just added new syscalls with well defined behaviour.

### New AT\_ flags for restricting pathname lookup

[[Link](/Articles/767773/)]

Something like resolveat(2)? The problem is that this would necessarily be conceptually identical to openat(O\_PATH). Maybe O\_PATH should've been a different syscall but we are mostly stuck with it now, and I think it would be strange to have two methods of opening an O\_PATH descriptor. Though, there are some aspects of O\_PATH that I think need to be fixed (and would require more convoluted O\_ flags -- maybe a new syscall is warranted to fix some of the semantics of O\_PATH. I'm not sure.)

And remember that the widespread utility of any resolveat(2) syscall would likely require having AT\_EMPTY\_PATH support for every \*at(2) syscall (which is unfortunately far from the case currently).

(Note: This PR was made public after discussions with the Docker security team, if you find a security vulnerability please report it directly to security@docker.com.)

There are certain classes of attacks (as evidenced in [CVE-2018-15664](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pv79-5r2c-jrpq "CVE-2018-15664"))

which are caused by our allowing container processes to be executing

while we are doing filesystem operations on the container. In

particular, [there are trivial TOCTOU races in symlink resolution and

scoping that can be exploited](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1096726).

The most complete solution to this problem would be to modify

chrootarchive so that all of the archive operations occur with the root

as the container rootfs (and not the parent directory, which is what

causes the vulnerability since the parent is attacker-controlled).

Unfortunately, changes to this core piece of Docker are almost

impossible (the TarUntar interface has many copies and reimplementations

that would all need to be modified to be able to handle a new "root"

argument).

So, we instead settle for the next-best option which is to pause the

container during our usage of the filesystem. This is far from an ideal

solution (you can image some attack scenarios such as shared volume

mounts) where this is ineffectual but it does block the most basic

attack.

[I am currently working on some new kernel functionality that would allow

for much safer resolution of paths inside untrusted roots](https://lwn.net/Articles/767547/), but as

above it would be difficult to modify Docker to use it. I am working on

adding support to [filepath-securejoin](https://github.com/cyphar/filepath-securejoin) though (however this will

require quite a few inteface changes).

Fixes: [CVE-2018-15664](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pv79-5r2c-jrpq "CVE-2018-15664")

| Since this is a security fix I'm not sure how good of an idea it is to allow disabling it -- the attack scripts I have allow attackers to read and write to anywhere on the host filesystem as root. Adding footguns for their own sake feels like a bad idea.  `docker commit -p` is more of a functional feature to (in theory) allow for atomic snapshots on storage drivers which don't have them (like overlayfs). |

| I can do some more testing to see how bad the impact is, but in theory we're talking about hundreds of milliseconds of downtime -- `docker pause` doesn't kill the container process after all it freezes the container's cgroup.

| For rootless we could just not do the pausing. As I mention in the commit message, this is a best-effort protection because (after spending several weeks working on it) I concluded it's effectively impossible to implement the actual protection necessary to defend against the attack in Docker. You would need to rewrite too many interfaces and too much glue code that it's not really doable anymore. |

| [@cpuguy83](https://github.com/cpuguy83) At the very end of the chain, `chrootarchive` is being used. The problem is that `chrootarchive` is being used to `chroot` into the parent directory of the directory where the extraction is occurring (which is attacker-controlled since it's inside the container). So, if you get hit by the race you end up `chroot`ing into the host filesystem. As I said above, this could be fixed by adding a `root` parameter to all of the `TarUntar` interfaces but this turns out to be quite hard purely due to the number of changes needed all over the place. |

The most complete solution to this problem would be to modify
chrootarchive so that all of the archive operations occur with the root
as the container rootfs (and not the parent directory, which is what
causes the vulnerability since the parent is attacker-controlled).
Unfortunately, changes to this core piece of Docker are almost
impossible (the TarUntar interface has many copies and reimplementations
that would all need to be modified to be able to handle a new \"root\"
argument).

So, we instead settle for the next-best option which is to pause the
container during our usage of the filesystem. This is far from an ideal
solution (you can image some attack scenarios such as shared volume
mounts) where this is ineffectual but it does block the most basic
attack.

I am currently working on some new kernel functionality that would allow
for much safer resolution of paths inside untrusted roots[2], but as
above it would be difficult to modify Docker to use it. I am working on
adding support to filepath-securejoin[3] though (however this will
require quite a few inteface changes).

```
There are certain classes of attacks (as evidenced in [CVE-2018-15664](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pv79-5r2c-jrpq "CVE-2018-15664"))
which are caused by our allowing container processes to be executing
while we are doing filesystem operations on the container. In
particular, there are trivial TOCTOU races in symlink resolution and
scoping that can be exploited[1].

| Thinking we could add a flag to set the daemon level default (`--default-pause-on-cp`)  Or alternatively we could add a flag which requires the user to set pause on cp (`--require-puase-on-cp`) and error out if pause is not specified.   ---   I will be happy to look at updating interfaces to make this better. I was already considering building an external tool to deal with container filesystem stuff for cases like `docker cp`, because it's pretty horrific today with manipulating mount namespaces in the root namespace and other things... which to provide any real benefit requires updating these interfaces anyway. |

| Just a thought, we could take a temporary snapshot on the fs if the container is running (the `if` part is just for optimization). I'm not sure if we would even need to modify the layer store/graphdriver api's for this.  /cc [@dmcgowan](https://github.com/dmcgowan) |

| Are there real use cases people really need `docker cp` and cannot live without it?  I am just saying if that is too complicated to fix and is too dangerous to leave, I would opt for having some flag like `--enable-insecure-docker-cp` for `dockerd`, but this is only because I am having in mind `docker cp` is a handy feature only for quick dev tests and that if someone needs to copy some data from the container, should rather use a shared docker volume or use other tools like `nsenter`. |

| [@arno01](https://github.com/arno01) it is hard to know how people are using `docker cp`; I hope people are not using it in production, just for dev. If this is the case, adding an automatic pause seems an ok mitigation without any additional changes for now. |

| I am afraid that pausing (SIGSTOP) containers is also a breaking change as it will lead to the error prone situations such as when someone is `docker cp`'ing something big as usual (for him, in a prod, maybe even scripted or just one time ad-hoc copy) will unexpectedly start pausing the running process which in turn (if left paused for too long) may break all network connections (or socket's buffer can fill up) to the service running in that container.  WDYT? |

It occurs in tcp_emu() routine while emulating Identification protocol and copying message data to a socket buffer.   A user/process could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process on the host resulting in DoS or potentially execute arbitrary code with privileges of the  QEMU process.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1096726#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2018-06-08 12:21:32 UTC  ``` via aleksa  From: Aleksa Sarai <asarai@suse.de> Subject: 'docker cp' is vulnerable to symlink-exchange race attacks Date: Fri, 8 Jun 2018 04:04:38 +1000  Hi all,  This is a bit of a continuation of 'docker cp' security bugs that I helped find and fix more than 4 years ago in 2014[1,2] (ouch, I feel old). The attack I outline here affects every version of Docker that has had 'docker cp' (which according to my watch is v0.6.0 from 2013 -- versions before [1,2] were even more trivially exploitable but this attack would work with them too).  To his credit, T=F5nis Tiigi mentioned this concern back when 'docker cp' was being modified to use ContainerArchivePath[3]. It is also something I had thought about when I was writing [1,2] but thought that the race window was too small for an attack to be practical (not to mention that [1,2] were considered to not be security fixes so I didn't give it much more thought). But after I saw CVE-2017-1002101, I was reminded of how difficult it is to sanely scope paths and decided to play around with some symlink-exchange attacks.  The basic premise of this attack is that FollowSymlinkInScope suffers from a fairly fundamental time-of-check-to-time-of-use (TOCTTOU if you love acronyms) attack. If you're not familiar with FollowSymlinkInScope, its job is to take a path and safely resolve it as though the process was inside the container. After the full path has been resolved, the resolved path is passed around a bit and then operated on a bit later (in the case of 'docker cp' it is opened when creating the archive that is streamed to the client). As you may notice, if an attacker can add a symlink component to the path *after* the resolution but *before* it is operated on, then you could end up resolving the symlink path component on the host as root. In the case of 'docker cp' this gives you read *and* write access to any path on the host.  Attached is a fairly dumb reproducer which basically does a RENAME_EXCHANGE of a symlink to "/" and an empty directory in a loop, hoping to hit the race condition. Then our "user" attempts to copy a file from the path repeatedly. You can call it like this (note that since this requires exploiting a race condition, only a small percentage of the attempts succeed -- however if I had made my reproducer a bit more clever about how quickly it does the RENAME_EXCHANGE it could be more likely to hit the race).    % ls   build  run.sh   % ./run.sh &>/dev/null & ; sleep 10s ; pkill -9 run.sh   % chmod 0644 ex*/out # to fix up permissions for grep   % grep 'SUCCESS' ex*/out | wc -l # managed to get it from the host   2   % grep 'FAILED'  ex*/out | wc -l # got the file from the container   334  Note that 'run.sh' will ask for your sudo permissions, this is purely to place a flag at /w00t_w00t_im_a_flag. You could use the same reproducer to get the host's /etc/shadow, but this way you can just grep for 'SUCCESS'. As I said above, the 0.6% success rate is quite bad, but if my reproducer had some more finely-tuned timing it might have a much better success rate (the race window is not that small -- the problem is that the path is used *multiple* times and each time it's used the archiving library might decide to not resolve the swapped symlink by accident).  Now, how do we fix this? Unfortunately there isn't an easy way of fixing this particular brand of TOCTTOU. The only way of really fixing it (on Linux -- I have no idea whether you'd need to fix it on Windows) would be to get an O_PATH file descriptor and operate on it when generating the archive. The simplest way of doing this would be to run a process inside a chroot(2) which just does an O_PATH and then sends the file descriptor back to dockerd using SCM_RIGHTS.  The more complicated way that wouldn't require spawning a new process (but would result in you returning an error if an attack like this is in progress, rather than returning a valid result) would involve something like:  1. Do the current FollowSymlinkInScope logic to get a resolved path, but    while resolving the path use O_PATH file descriptors that you keep    around and operate through them.  2. After you've gotten the fully resolved path, open it with O_PATH.    This is the file descriptor we will return if our validation    succeeds. We now repeat the following step, using our existing O_PATH    of the directory containing the fully resolved path as "parent_fd",    and the fully resolved path's O_PATH as "current_fd".    "next_path_component" is always the basename of "current_fd".  3. Do fstatat(parent_fd, next_path_component, ...) to see whether the    next_path_component has the d_ino we expected (we compare this to    fstat(current_fd, ...)). If they don't match, we error out. Otherwise    we set parent_fd =3D openat(parent_fd, ".."). Continue this until    current_fd is "/".  An important thing to note is that we have to modify our logic (in both cases) in order to handle non-existent paths. FollowSymlinkInScope allows you to scope non-existent paths (where the path components that don't exist are just appended to the end), which requires a bit more work to make safe. In principle this means that we will need to return an O_PATH of the closest existing ancestor along with what path components were left. I'm not sure there's really a safe way of doing that though (a malicious process could make any of those trailing path components symlinks, opening this can of worms again).  One other problem with the more complicated way of doing the resolution is that we might need to be careful about comparing d_ino since different filesystems could have the same d_ino for completely different files (and I think FUSE can fake d_ino). So we would have to do an fstatfs(2) as well and make sure that f_fsid and f_type are the same.  I'm a little bit sorry for dumping this one on you without a proper fix in mind, because I helped write the original security fixes and I know how hard it's going to be to make this safe. I really think there should be a kernel interface like openat(..., O_NOFOLLOW|O_SERIOUSLY_NOFOLLOW) which would cause symlinks to not be resolved as path components. Actually maybe I could rustle up a kernel patch for that. The downside is that you wouldn't be able to use this on older kernels, so that's a bit of an issue.

I've submitted a patch upstream[1] which is still undergoing code review, and after discussion with them they agreed that public disclosure of the issue was reasonable. Since the SUSE bug report contains exploit scripts[2], I've attached them here too.  This attack was discovered by myself (Aleksa Sarai), though T=F5nis Tiigi did mention the possibility of an attack like this in the past (at the time we thought the race window was to small to exploit). In addition, you could see this exploit as a continuation of some 'docker cp' security bugs that I helped find and fix more than 4 years ago in 2014[3,4] (these were never assigned CVEs because at the time it was thought that attacks which used access to docker.sock were not valid security bugs).  [[ Overview ]]  The basic premise of this attack is that FollowSymlinkInScope suffers =66rom a fairly fundamental TOCTOU attack. The purpose of FollowSymlinkInScope is to take a given path and safely resolve it as though the process was inside the container. After the full path has been resolved, the resolved path is passed around a bit and then operated on a bit later (in the case of 'docker cp' it is opened when creating the archive that is streamed to the client). If an attacker can add a symlink component to the path *after* the resolution but *before* it is operated on, then you could end up resolving the symlink path component on the host as root. In the case of 'docker cp' this gives you read *and* write access to any path on the host.  As far as I'm aware there are no meaningful protections against this kind of attack (other than not allowing "docker cp" on running containers -- but that only helps with his particular attack through FollowSymlinkInScope). Unless you have restricted the Docker daemon through AppArmor, then it can affect the host filesystem -- I haven't verified if the issue is as exploitable under the default SELinux configuration on Fedora/CentOS/RHEL.  [[ Exploit Scripts ]]  Attacked are two reproducers of the issue. They both include a Docker image which contains a simple binary that does a RENAME_EXCHANGE of a symlink to "/" and an empty directory in a loop, hoping to hit the race condition. In both of the scripts, the user is trying to copy a file to or from a path containing the swapped symlink.  In the case of run_read.sh, I get a <1% chance of hitting the race condition (my attack script is quite dumb, it's possible with better timing you'd be able to hit the race window much more effectively). However <1% still means it only takes 10s of trying to get read access to the host with root permissions.    % ./run_read.sh &>/dev/null & ; sleep 10s ; pkill -9 run.sh   % chmod 0644 ex*/out # to fix up permissions for grep   % grep 'SUCCESS' ex*/out | wc -l # managed to get it from the host   2   % grep 'FAILED'  ex*/out | wc -l # got the file from the container   334  However, the run_write.sh script can overwrite the host filesystem in very few iterations -- this is because internally Docker has a "chrootarchive" concept where the archive is extracted from within a chroot. However, Docker doesn't chroot into the container's "/" (which would make this exploit ineffective), it chroots into the parent directory of the archive target -- which is attacker controlled. As a result, this actually results in the attack being more likely to succeed (once the chroot has hit the race, the rest of the attack is guaranteed to succeed).  The scripts will ask for sudo permissions, but that is only to be able to create a "flag file" in /. You could modify the scripts to target /etc/shadow instead if you like.  [[ Future Work ]]  In an attempt to come up with a better solution for this problem, I've been working on some Linux kernel patches which add the ability to safely resolve paths from within a rootfs[5]. But they are still being reviewed and it will take a while for userspace to be able to take advantage of the new interfaces. However, I am also working on redesigning my "secure join" library's API[6] so that we can at least better detect these attacks on older kernels and take advantage of [5] in newer kernels.

An update that solves three vulnerabilities and has four
fixes is now available.
Description:
This is a version update for podman to version 1.4.4 (bsc#1143386).
Additional changes by SUSE on top:
- Remove fuse-overlayfs because it's (currently) an unsatisfied dependency
on SLE (bsc#1143386)
- Update libpod.conf to use correct infra\_command
- Update libpod.conf to use better versioned pause container
- Update libpod.conf to use official kubic pause container
- Update libpod.conf to match latest features set: detach\_keys, lock\_type,
runtime\_supports\_json
- Add podman-remote varlink client
Version update podman to v1.4.4:
- Features
- Podman now has greatly improved support for containers using multiple
OCI runtimes. Containers now remember if they were created with a
different runtime using --runtime and will always use that runtime
- The cached and delegated options for volume mounts are now allowed for
Docker compatability (#3340)
- The podman diff command now supports the --latest flag
- Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would attempt to use the entire root
configuration if no rootless configuration was present for the user,
breaking rootless Podman for new installations
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman's pause process would block SIGTERM,
preventing graceful system shutdown and hanging until the system's
init send SIGKILL
- Fixed a bug where running Podman as root with sudo -E would not work
after running rootless Podman at least once
- Fixed a bug where options for tmpfs volumes added with the --tmpfs
flag were being ignored
- Fixed a bug where images with no layers could not properly be
displayed and removed by Podman
- Fixed a bug where locks were not properly freed on failure to create a
container or pod
- Fixed a bug where podman cp on a single file would create a directory
at the target and place the file in it (#3384)
- Fixed a bug where podman inspect --format '{{.Mounts}}' would print a
hexadecimal address instead of a container's mounts
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would not add an entry to
container's /etc/hosts files for their own hostname (#3405)
- Fixed a bug where podman ps --sync would segfault (#3411)
- Fixed a bug where podman generate kube would produce an invalid ports
configuration (#3408)
- Misc
- Updated containers/storage to v1.12.13
- Podman now performs much better on systems with heavy I/O load
- The --cgroup-manager flag to podman now shows the correct default
setting in help if the default was overridden by libpod.conf
- For backwards compatability, setting --log-driver=json-file in podman
run is now supported as an alias for --log-driver=k8s-file. This is
considered deprecated, and json-file will be moved to a new
implementation in the future
([#3363]([https://github.com/containers/libpo\](https://github.com/containers/libpo%5C) d/issues/3363))
- Podman's default libpod.conf file now allows the crun OCI runtime to
be used if it is installed
Update podman to v1.4.2:
- Fixed a bug where Podman could not run containers using an older version
of Systemd as init
- Updated vendored Buildah to v1.9.0 to resolve a critical bug with
Dockerfile RUN instructions
- The error message for running podman kill on containers that are not
running has been improved
- Podman remote client can now log to a file if syslog is not available
- The podman exec command now sets its error code differently based on
whether the container does not exist, and the command in the container
does not exist
- The podman inspect command on containers now outputs Mounts JSON that
matches that of docker inspect, only including user-specified volumes
and differentiating bind mounts and named volumes
- The podman inspect command now reports the path to a container's OCI
spec with the OCIConfigPath key (only included when the container is
initialized
or running)
- The podman run --mount command now supports the bind-nonrecursive option
for bind mounts
- Fixed a bug where podman play kube would fail to create containers due
to an unspecified log driver
- Fixed a bug where Podman would fail to build with musl libc
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman using slirp4netns networking in an
environment with no nameservers on the host other than localhost would
result in nonfunctional networking
- Fixed a bug where podman import would not properly set environment
variables, discarding their values and retaining only keys
- Fixed a bug where Podman would fail to run when built with Apparmor
support but run on systems without the Apparmor kernel module loaded
- Remote Podman will now default the username it uses to log in to remote
systems to the username of the current user
- Podman now uses JSON logging with OCI runtimes that support it, allowing
for better error reporting
- Updated vendored containers/image to v2.0
- Update conmon to v0.3.0
- Support OOM Monitor under cgroup V2
- Add config binary and make target for configuring conmon with a go
library for importing values
Updated podman to version 1.4.0 (bsc#1137860) and (bsc#1135460)
- Podman checkpoint and podman restore commands can now be used to migrate
containers between Podman installations on different systems.
- The podman cp now supports pause flag.
- The remote client now supports a configuration file for pre-configuring
connections to remote Podman installations
- CVE-2019-10152: Fixed an iproper dereference of symlinks of the the
podman cp command which introduced in version 1.1.0 (bsc#1136974).
- Fixed a bug where podman commit could improperly set environment
variables that contained = characters
- Fixed a bug where rootless podman would sometimes fail to start
containers with forwarded ports
- Fixed a bug where podman version on the remote client could segfault
- Fixed a bug where podman container runlabel would use /proc/self/exe
instead of the path of the Podman command when printing the command
being executed
- Fixed a bug where filtering images by label did not work
- Fixed a bug where specifying a bing mount or tmpfs mount over an image
volume would cause a container to be unable to start
- Fixed a bug where podman generate kube did not work with containers with
named volumes
- Fixed a bug where rootless podman would receive permission denied errors
accessing conmon.pid
- Fixed a bug where podman cp with a folder specified as target would
replace the folder, as opposed to copying into it
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman commands could double-unlock a lock,
causing a crash
- Fixed a bug where podman incorrectly set tmpcopyup on /dev/ mounts,
causing errors when using the Kata containers runtime
- Fixed a bug where podman exec would fail on older kernels

client and server in podman version
- The podman unshare command has been added, allowing easy entry into the
user namespace set up by rootless Podman (allowing the removal of files
created by rootless podman, among other things)
- Fixed a bug where Podman containers with the --rm flag were removing
created volumes when they were automatically removed
- Fixed a bug where container and pod locks were incorrectly marked as
released after a system reboot, causing errors on container and pod
removal
- Fixed a bug where Podman pods could not be removed if any container in
the pod encountered an error during removal
- Fixed a bug where Podman pods run with the cgroupfs CGroup driver would
encounter a race condition during removal, potentially failing to remove
the pod CGroup
- Fixed a bug where the podman container checkpoint and podman container
restore commands were not visible in the remote client
- Fixed a bug where podman remote ps --ns would not print the container's
namespaces

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# CVE-2018-15664

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2018-15607.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2018-15671.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2018-15664 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15664)

#### Description

In Docker through 18.06.1-ce-rc2, the API endpoints behind the 'docker cp' command are vulnerable to a symlink-exchange attack with Directory Traversal, giving attackers arbitrary read-write access to the host filesystem with root privileges, because daemon/archive.go does not do archive operations on a frozen filesystem (or from within a chroot).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1096726#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2018-06-08 12:21:32 UTC  ``` via aleksa  From: Aleksa Sarai <asarai@suse.de> Subject: 'docker cp' is vulnerable to symlink-exchange race attacks Date: Fri, 8 Jun 2018 04:04:38 +1000  Hi all,  This is a bit of a continuation of 'docker cp' security bugs that I helped find and fix more than 4 years ago in 2014[1,2] (ouch, I feel old). The attack I outline here affects every version of Docker that has had 'docker cp' (which according to my watch is v0.6.0 from 2013 -- versions before [1,2] were even more trivially exploitable but this attack would work with them too).  To his credit, T=F5nis Tiigi mentioned this concern back when 'docker cp' was being modified to use ContainerArchivePath[3]. It is also something I had thought about when I was writing [1,2] but thought that the race window was too small for an attack to be practical (not to mention that [1,2] were considered to not be security fixes so I didn't give it much more thought). But after I saw CVE-2017-1002101, I was reminded of how difficult it is to sanely scope paths and decided to play around with some symlink-exchange attacks.  The basic premise of this attack is that FollowSymlinkInScope suffers from a fairly fundamental time-of-check-to-time-of-use (TOCTTOU if you love acronyms) attack. If you're not familiar with FollowSymlinkInScope, its job is to take a path and safely resolve it as though the process was inside the container. After the full path has been resolved, the resolved path is passed around a bit and then operated on a bit later (in the case of 'docker cp' it is opened when creating the archive that is streamed to the client). As you may notice, if an attacker can add a symlink component to the path *after* the resolution but *before* it is operated on, then you could end up resolving the symlink path component on the host as root. In the case of 'docker cp' this gives you read *and* write access to any path on the host.  Attached is a fairly dumb reproducer which basically does a RENAME_EXCHANGE of a symlink to "/" and an empty directory in a loop, hoping to hit the race condition. Then our "user" attempts to copy a file from the path repeatedly. You can call it like this (note that since this requires exploiting a race condition, only a small percentage of the attempts succeed -- however if I had made my reproducer a bit more clever about how quickly it does the RENAME_EXCHANGE it could be more likely to hit the race).    % ls   build  run.sh   % ./run.sh &>/dev/null & ; sleep 10s ; pkill -9 run.sh   % chmod 0644 ex*/out # to fix up permissions for grep   % grep 'SUCCESS' ex*/out | wc -l # managed to get it from the host   2   % grep 'FAILED'  ex*/out | wc -l # got the file from the container   334  Note that 'run.sh' will ask for your sudo permissions, this is purely to place a flag at /w00t_w00t_im_a_flag. You could use the same reproducer to get the host's /etc/shadow, but this way you can just grep for 'SUCCESS'. As I said above, the 0.6% success rate is quite bad, but if my reproducer had some more finely-tuned timing it might have a much better success rate (the race window is not that small -- the problem is that the path is used *multiple* times and each time it's used the archiving library might decide to not resolve the swapped symlink by accident).  Now, how do we fix this? Unfortunately there isn't an easy way of fixing this particular brand of TOCTTOU. The only way of really fixing it (on Linux -- I have no idea whether you'd need to fix it on Windows) would be to get an O_PATH file descriptor and operate on it when generating the archive. The simplest way of doing this would be to run a process inside a chroot(2) which just does an O_PATH and then sends the file descriptor back to dockerd using SCM_RIGHTS.  The more complicated way that wouldn't require spawning a new process (but would result in you returning an error if an attack like this is in progress, rather than returning a valid result) would involve something like:  1. Do the current FollowSymlinkInScope logic to get a resolved path, but    while resolving the path use O_PATH file descriptors that you keep    around and operate through them.  2. After you've gotten the fully resolved path, open it with O_PATH.    This is the file descriptor we will return if our validation    succeeds. We now repeat the following step, using our existing O_PATH    of the directory containing the fully resolved path as "parent_fd",    and the fully resolved path's O_PATH as "current_fd".    "next_path_component" is always the basename of "current_fd".  3. Do fstatat(parent_fd, next_path_component, ...) to see whether the    next_path_component has the d_ino we expected (we compare this to    fstat(current_fd, ...)). If they don't match, we error out. Otherwise    we set parent_fd =3D openat(parent_fd, ".."). Continue this until    current_fd is "/".  An important thing to note is that we have to modify our logic (in both cases) in order to handle non-existent paths. FollowSymlinkInScope allows you to scope non-existent paths (where the path components that don't exist are just appended to the end), which requires a bit more work to make safe. In principle this means that we will need to return an O_PATH of the closest existing ancestor along with what path components were left. I'm not sure there's really a safe way of doing that though (a malicious process could make any of those trailing path components symlinks, opening this can of worms again).  One other problem with the more complicated way of doing the resolution is that we might need to be careful about comparing d_ino since different filesystems could have the same d_ino for completely different files (and I think FUSE can fake d_ino). So we would have to do an fstatfs(2) as well and make sure that f_fsid and f_type are the same.  I'm a little bit sorry for dumping this one on you without a proper fix in mind, because I helped write the original security fixes and I know how hard it's going to be to make this safe. I really think there should be a kernel interface like openat(..., O_NOFOLLOW|O_SERIOUSLY_NOFOLLOW) which would cause symlinks to not be resolved as path components. Actually maybe I could rustle up a kernel patch for that. The downside is that you wouldn't be able to use this on older kernels, so that's a bit of an issue.

I've submitted a patch upstream[1] which is still undergoing code review, and after discussion with them they agreed that public disclosure of the issue was reasonable. Since the SUSE bug report contains exploit scripts[2], I've attached them here too.  This attack was discovered by myself (Aleksa Sarai), though T=F5nis Tiigi did mention the possibility of an attack like this in the past (at the time we thought the race window was to small to exploit). In addition, you could see this exploit as a continuation of some 'docker cp' security bugs that I helped find and fix more than 4 years ago in 2014[3,4] (these were never assigned CVEs because at the time it was thought that attacks which used access to docker.sock were not valid security bugs).  [[ Overview ]]  The basic premise of this attack is that FollowSymlinkInScope suffers =66rom a fairly fundamental TOCTOU attack. The purpose of FollowSymlinkInScope is to take a given path and safely resolve it as though the process was inside the container. After the full path has been resolved, the resolved path is passed around a bit and then operated on a bit later (in the case of 'docker cp' it is opened when creating the archive that is streamed to the client). If an attacker can add a symlink component to the path *after* the resolution but *before* it is operated on, then you could end up resolving the symlink path component on the host as root. In the case of 'docker cp' this gives you read *and* write access to any path on the host.  As far as I'm aware there are no meaningful protections against this kind of attack (other than not allowing "docker cp" on running containers -- but that only helps with his particular attack through FollowSymlinkInScope). Unless you have restricted the Docker daemon through AppArmor, then it can affect the host filesystem -- I haven't verified if the issue is as exploitable under the default SELinux configuration on Fedora/CentOS/RHEL.  [[ Exploit Scripts ]]  Attacked are two reproducers of the issue. They both include a Docker image which contains a simple binary that does a RENAME_EXCHANGE of a symlink to "/" and an empty directory in a loop, hoping to hit the race condition. In both of the scripts, the user is trying to copy a file to or from a path containing the swapped symlink.  In the case of run_read.sh, I get a <1% chance of hitting the race condition (my attack script is quite dumb, it's possible with better timing you'd be able to hit the race window much more effectively). However <1% still means it only takes 10s of trying to get read access to the host with root permissions.    % ./run_read.sh &>/dev/null & ; sleep 10s ; pkill -9 run.sh   % chmod 0644 ex*/out # to fix up permissions for grep   % grep 'SUCCESS' ex*/out | wc -l # managed to get it from the host   2   % grep 'FAILED'  ex*/out | wc -l # got the file from the container   334  However, the run_write.sh script can overwrite the host filesystem in very few iterations -- this is because internally Docker has a "chrootarchive" concept where the archive is extracted from within a chroot. However, Docker doesn't chroot into the container's "/" (which would make this exploit ineffective), it chroots into the parent directory of the archive target -- which is attacker controlled. As a result, this actually results in the attack being more likely to succeed (once the chroot has hit the race, the rest of the attack is guaranteed to succeed).  The scripts will ask for sudo permissions, but that is only to be able to create a "flag file" in /. You could modify the scripts to target /etc/shadow instead if you like.  [[ Future Work ]]  In an attempt to come up with a better solution for this problem, I've been working on some Linux kernel patches which add the ability to safely resolve paths from within a rootfs[5]. But they are still being reviewed and it will take a while for userspace to be able to take advantage of the new interfaces. However, I am also working on redesigning my "secure join" library's API[6] so that we can at least better detect these attacks on older kernels and take advantage of [5] in newer kernels.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the xen package

This issue likely only affects the XEN hypervisor itself, unless otherwise stated. The userland utilities in -tools and libraries in -libs are shipped together with the xen hypervisor as they are built from one source and do not contain hypervisor specific fixes.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [1123156](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1123156) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1123157](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1123157) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1178658](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1178658) [RESOLVED / FIXED]

Functions that use functions like ResolvePath(), GetResourcePath(), FollowSymlinkInScope() and others similar to those, may be vulnerable to a Time of Check to Time Of Use(TOCTOU) vulnerability, where the resolved path may be correctly scoped inside the container at the time of the check, but it escapes into the host filesystem at the time of use.  In particular, containerArchivePath() and containerExtractToDir() are used when copying files respectively from and to a container and they are vulnerable to this flaw.

For clarity, in the "Affected Packages State" table, we only include OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) versions 3.7 and below because for these versions docker was shipped as part of the release.  For all subsequent versions of OCP until 3.11, docker is installed from the RHEL Extras repository meaning clusters will be vulnerable to the flaw unless an updated docker package has been applied.

Subject: CVE-2018-15664: docker (all versions) is vulnerable to a
 symlink-race attack

There is no released Docker version with a fix for this issue at the
time of writing. I've submitted a patch upstream[1] which is still
undergoing code review, and after discussion with them they agreed that
public disclosure of the issue was reasonable. Since the SUSE bug report
contains exploit scripts[2], I've attached them here too.

This attack was discovered by myself (Aleksa Sarai), though Tõnis Tiigi
did mention the possibility of an attack like this in the past (at the
time we thought the race window was to small to exploit). In addition,
you could see this exploit as a continuation of some 'docker cp'
security bugs that I helped find and fix more than 4 years ago in
2014[3,4] (these were never assigned CVEs because at the time it was
thought that attacks which used access to docker.sock were not valid
security bugs).

[[ Overview ]]

The basic premise of this attack is that FollowSymlinkInScope suffers
from a fairly fundamental TOCTOU attack. The purpose of
FollowSymlinkInScope is to take a given path and safely resolve it as
though the process was inside the container. After the full path has
been resolved, the resolved path is passed around a bit and then
operated on a bit later (in the case of 'docker cp' it is opened when
creating the archive that is streamed to the client). If an attacker can
add a symlink component to the path *after* the resolution but *before*
it is operated on, then you could end up resolving the symlink path
component on the host as root. In the case of 'docker cp' this gives you
read *and* write access to any path on the host.

As far as I'm aware there are no meaningful protections against this
kind of attack (other than not allowing "docker cp" on running
containers -- but that only helps with his particular attack through
FollowSymlinkInScope). Unless you have restricted the Docker daemon
through AppArmor, then it can affect the host filesystem -- I haven't
verified if the issue is as exploitable under the default SELinux
configuration on Fedora/CentOS/RHEL.

[[ Exploit Scripts ]]

Attacked are two reproducers of the issue. They both include a Docker
image which contains a simple binary that does a RENAME_EXCHANGE of a
symlink to "/" and an empty directory in a loop, hoping to hit the race
condition. In both of the scripts, the user is trying to copy a file to
or from a path containing the swapped symlink.

In the case of run_read.sh, I get a <1% chance of hitting the race
condition (my attack script is quite dumb, it's possible with better
timing you'd be able to hit the race window much more effectively).
However <1% still means it only takes 10s of trying to get read access
to the host with root permissions.

  % ./run_read.sh &>/dev/null & ; sleep 10s ; pkill -9 run.sh
  % chmod 0644 ex*/out # to fix up permissions for grep
  % grep 'SUCCESS' ex*/out | wc -l # managed to get it from the host
  2
  % grep 'FAILED'  ex*/out | wc -l # got the file from the container
  334

However, the run_write.sh script can overwrite the host filesystem in
very few iterations -- this is because internally Docker has a
"chrootarchive" concept where the archive is extracted from within a
chroot. However, Docker doesn't chroot into the container's "/" (which
would make this exploit ineffective), it chroots into the parent
directory of the archive target -- which is attacker controlled. As a
result, this actually results in the attack being more likely to succeed
(once the chroot has hit the race, the rest of the attack is guaranteed
to succeed).

The scripts will ask for sudo permissions, but that is only to be able
to create a "flag file" in /. You could modify the scripts to target
/etc/shadow instead if you like.

[[ Future Work ]]

In an attempt to come up with a better solution for this problem, I've
been working on some Linux kernel patches which add the ability to
safely resolve paths from within a rootfs[5]. But they are still being
reviewed and it will take a while for userspace to be able to take
advantage of the new interfaces. However, I am also working on
redesigning my "secure join" library's API[6] so that we can at least
better detect these attacks on older kernels and take advantage of [5]
in newer kernels.

Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

## Description

In Docker through 18.06.1-ce-rc2, the API endpoints behind the 'docker cp' command are vulnerable to a symlink-exchange attack with Directory Traversal, giving attackers arbitrary read-write access to the host filesystem with root privileges, because daemon/archive.go does not do archive operations on a frozen filesystem (or from within a chroot).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
