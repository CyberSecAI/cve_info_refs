**Details:**

**CVE Identifier**: CVE-2018-15766

**Severity**: Medium

**Note:** For more information about CVE Identifiers, reference <https://www.cvedetails.com/cve-help.php>
![This hyperlink is taking you to a website outside of Dell Technologies.](https://i.dell.com/is/image/DellContent/pop-up-arrow-corner-carbon-64px-1 "This hyperlink is taking you to a website outside of Dell Technologies.") .
#### Cause

On install, Dell Encryption versions prior 10.0.1 and Dell Endpoint Security Suite Enterprise versions prior 2.0.1 overwrites and manually set the **Minimum Password Length** group policy object to a value of 1 on that device. This allows for users to bypass any existing policy for password length and potentially create insecure password on their device.

This value is defined during the installation of the **Encryption Management Agent** or **EMAgent** application. There are no other known values that are modified.

#### Resolution

The following Dell Data Security releases contain resolutions to this vulnerability:

* Dell Encryption version 10.0.1 and later
* Dell Endpoint Security Suite Enterprise version 2.0.1 and later

Customers can download Dell Encryption software from [https://www.dell.com/support/home/product-support/product/dell-data-protection-encryption/drivers](https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us/product-support/product/dell-data-protection-encryption/drivers).

Dell Endpoint Security Suite Enterprise software is made available to customers on their ddpe.credant.com accounts, or can be obtained through Dell ProSupport.

**Workaround:**

For affected devices, the minimum password length policy should be changed manually to what is wanted for the current environment.

* If Dell Endpoint Security Suite Enterprise or Dell Encryption Enterprise’s Encryption Management Agent is installed on a domain controller or a device that is not joined to a domain, the default minimum password length must be changed on the local device.
* If Dell Endpoint Security Suite Enterprise or Dell Encryption Enterprise’s Encryption Management Agent is installed on a device that is joined to a domain, the default minimum password length must be changed within the enterprise’s Group Policy Management console.

Default value for this property is **7** in most configurations.

This Microsoft KB article outlines how to modify this setting:

# CVE Terminology

## What is CVE?

CVE is a list of information security vulnerabilities and exposures that aims to provide common names for publicly known problems.
The goal of CVE is to make it easier to share data across separate vulnerability capabilities (tools, repositories, and services) with this "common enumeration."
Please visit <https://cve.mitre.org/>
and
<https://www.cve.org>
for more information

## What is a "Vulnerability?"

An information security "vulnerability" is a mistake in software that can be directly used by a hacker to gain access to a system or network.

## What is an "Exposure?"

An information security exposure is a mistake in software that allows access to information or capabilities that can be used by a hacker as a stepping-stone into a system or network.

## What is a CVE Identifier?

CVE Identifiers (also called "CVE names," "CVE numbers," "CVE-IDs," and "CVEs") are unique, common identifiers for publicly known information security vulnerabilities.
Each CVE Identifier includes the following:

 - CVE identifier number (i.e., "CVE-1999-0067").

 - Indication of "entry" or "candidate" status.

 - Brief description of the security vulnerability or exposure.

 - Any pertinent references (i.e., vulnerability reports and advisories or OVAL-ID).

 - CVE Identifiers are used by information security product/service vendors and researchers as a standard method for
identifying vulnerabilities and for cross-linking with other repositories that also use CVE Identifiers.

## Who owns CVE?

The mission of the CVE® Program is to identify, define, and catalog publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
The CVE Board oversees CVE Program operations and determines its strategic direction.
The Secretariat (currently The MITRE Corporation) provides administrative and logistical
support to the CVE Board and maintains the CVE Program’s infrastructure.
Please visit [cve.mitre.org](http://cve.mitre.org/)
and <https://www.cve.org> for more information.

CVE Program is sponsored by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).
CVE and the CVE logo are registered trademarks of The MITRE Corporation.

## What is NVD?

National Vulnerability Database, NVD, is the U.S. government repository of standards based vulnerability management data.
Please visit [https://nvd.nist.gov/general/FAQ-Sections/General-FAQs](https://nvd.nist.gov/general/faq)
for more information about NVD.

## What is CPE?

Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) is a standardized method of describing and identifying classes of applications,
operating systems, and hardware devices present among an enterprise's computing assets.
CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages based upon the generic syntax for Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI), CPE includes a formal name format,
a method for checking names against a system, and a description format for binding text and tests to a name.
Please visit <https://nvd.nist.gov/products/cpe>
and
