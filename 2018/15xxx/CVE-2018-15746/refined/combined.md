#### Vulnerability Information

Vulnerability Type

CWE-ID

Definition

Buffer Overflow

[CWE-119](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)

The software performs operations on a memory buffer, but it can read from or write to a memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer.

Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

[CWE-79](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

SQL Injection

[CWE-89](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)

The software constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Directory Traversal

[CWE-22](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)

The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the software does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

XML External Entity (XXE)

[CWE-611](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html)

The software processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.

Insecure Permissions

[CWE-276](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/276.html)

The software, upon installation, sets incorrect permissions for an object that exposes it to an unintended actor.

Incorrect Access Control

[CWE-284](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)

The software does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.

Integer Overflow

[CWE-190](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html)

The software performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or execution control.

Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

[CWE-352](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html)

The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

Missing SSL certification verification

[CWE-599](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/599.html)

The software uses OpenSSL and trusts or uses a certificate without using the SSL\_get\_verify\_result() function to ensure that the certificate satisfies all necessary security requirements.

Other or Unknown

N/A

The software contains a mistake other than above which can be directly used by a hacker to gain access to a system or network.

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

## [Qemu-devel] seccomp blacklist is not applied to all threads

Hi!

I have noticed that when a QEMU build from git master is started with
"-seccomp on", the seccomp policy is only applied to the main thread,
the vcpu worker thread and the VNC thread (I'm using VNC in my
config); the seccomp policy is not applied to e.g. the RCU thread
because it is created before the seccomp policy is applied and
SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_TSYNC isn't used. In practice, this makes the
seccomp policy essentially useless. You'll probably want to add
something like seccomp_attr_set(ctx, SCMP_FLTATR_CTL_TSYNC, 1) for
systems with kernel >=3.17; if you have to support seccomp on older
kernels, you'll have to either construct the other threads after
initializing seccomp or manually activate seccomp on those threads.

This shows up in strace as follows:

## [Qemu-devel] [PATCH v4 4/4] seccomp: set the seccomp filter to all threa

---

| **From**: | Marc-AndrÃ© Lureau |
| --- | --- |

| **Subject**: | [Qemu-devel] [PATCH v4 4/4] seccomp: set the seccomp filter to all threads |
| **Date**: | Wed, 22 Aug 2018 19:02:50 +0200 |

---

```
When using "-seccomp on", the seccomp policy is only applied to the
main thread, the vcpu worker thread and other worker threads created
after seccomp policy is applied; the seccomp policy is not applied to
e.g. the RCU thread because it is created before the seccomp policy is
applied and SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_TSYNC isn't used.

This can be verified with
for task in /proc/`pidof qemu`/task/*; do cat $task/status | grep Secc ; done

Starting with libseccomp 2.2.0 and kernel >= 3.17, we can use
seccomp_attr_set(ctx, > SCMP_FLTATR_CTL_TSYNC, 1) to update the policy
on all threads.

libseccomp requirement was bumped to 2.2.0 in previous patch.
libseccomp should fail to set the filter if it can't honour
SCMP_FLTATR_CTL_TSYNC (untested), and thus -sandbox will now fail on
kernel < 3.17.
