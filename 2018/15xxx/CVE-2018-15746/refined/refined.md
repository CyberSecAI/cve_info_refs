Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-15746:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in how QEMU implements seccomp sandboxing. Specifically, the seccomp policy was not being applied consistently across all threads created by the QEMU process. Some threads, like the RCU thread, were created before the seccomp policy was applied and therefore were not subject to the restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Inconsistent Seccomp Application:** The primary weakness is that the seccomp filter, designed to restrict system calls, was not uniformly applied to all QEMU threads. This left some threads running without the intended security restrictions.
- **Lack of TSYNC Flag:** The vulnerability specifically highlights the absence of the `SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_TSYNC` flag or equivalent handling. This flag, when properly set during seccomp initialization, ensures that the filter is applied to all existing and newly created threads.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Guest Escape:**  A malicious guest user or process could potentially exploit this flaw to bypass the intended seccomp restrictions.
- **Host System Compromise:** By invoking restricted system calls from an unsandboxed thread, an attacker could potentially interact with the host system and potentially escalate privileges or cause a denial of service.
- **Guest Crash:**  The vulnerability could be used to crash the guest, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition for the virtualized environment.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Guest User/Process:**  An attacker would need to have code execution within the guest operating system, which then tries to make system calls that would be blocked by the seccomp filter if properly applied.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Code Execution within Guest:** The attacker must be able to run code within the virtual machine (guest).
- **Knowledge of Restricted System Calls:** The attacker must have some knowledge of which system calls are restricted by the seccomp policy and find an unsandboxed thread to invoke it from.

**Additional Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability was discovered because threads were created before seccomp filter was applied.
- The fix was to set `SCMP_FLTATR_CTL_TSYNC` attribute of seccomp context in Qemu, which will apply the filter on all threads, including threads that were already running.
- The fix requires libseccomp 2.2.0 or higher.
- The vulnerability can be verified by checking the Seccomp value for different threads of Qemu process in the /proc/ directory.
- The vulnerability can be traced using strace.
