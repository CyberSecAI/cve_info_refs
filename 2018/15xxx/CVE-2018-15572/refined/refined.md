  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2018-15572",
    "description": "It was discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and prediction of return addresses via Return Stack Buffer (RSB) may allow unauthorized memory reads via sidechannel attacks. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.",
    "affected_components": [
      "microprocessors",
      "Linux kernel"
    ],
    "root_cause": "Microprocessors speculatively execute instructions and predict return addresses via Return Stack Buffer (RSB), which can be exploited to leak information.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Speculative execution",
      "Side-channel attack",
      "Information Leak"
    ],
    "impact": "Unauthorized memory reads, exposure of sensitive information, potentially including kernel memory.",
    "attack_vector": "Side-channel attack using speculative execution.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Local attacker with the ability to execute code on the vulnerable system."
