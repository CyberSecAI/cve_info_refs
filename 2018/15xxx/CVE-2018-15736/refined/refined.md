The provided content includes information about multiple vulnerabilities. Based on the provided table, CVE-2018-15736 relates to a Denial of Service vulnerability with IOCTL `0x8000204F`.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of validation of the output buffer address when handling IOCTL `0x8000204F`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the missing validation of the output buffer address in the kernel driver, which allows an attacker to supply an invalid address.

**Impact of exploitation:**
By providing an invalid output buffer address, an attacker can trigger a denial of service, causing the system to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is sending the specific IOCTL (0x8000204F) to the vulnerable kernel driver with a crafted output buffer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to interact with the driver, which typically requires a local account with sufficient privileges to communicate with the driver.
