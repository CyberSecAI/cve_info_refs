The vulnerability exists because under specific circumstances, the affected software enables a privileged user account without notifying administrators of the system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using this account to log in to an affected device and execute commands with full admin rights.  Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. This advisory will be updated with fixed software information once fixed software becomes available. There is a workaround to address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects the following Cisco Small Business product families running any software release if no user accounts with access privilege set to level 15 are configured on the device:    + Cisco Small Business 200 Series Smart Switches   + Cisco Small Business 300 Series Managed Switches   + Cisco Small Business 500 Series Stackable Managed Switches   + Cisco 250 Series Smart Switches   + Cisco 350 Series Managed Switches   + Cisco 350X Series Stackable Managed Switches   + Cisco 550X Series Stackable Managed Switches**Determining the Cisco Small Business Switches Software Release** To determine which Cisco Small Business Switches Software release is running on a device, use the **show version** command from the CLI prompt. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running software version 1.4.9.4:  ```   Switch# show version   SW version    1.4.9.04 (date 20-Jul-2018 time 17:14:12)   ``` **Determining If Privilege Level 15 User Accounts Are Present on the Device Configuration** To determine if any privilege level 15 user accounts are present in the device configuration, use the command **show running-config | include privilege 15** from a CLI prompt. An empty output would indicate that no user accounts with level 15 access privilege are configured on the device; the device is vulnerable if also running an affected software release.  The following example shows the output of the command **show running-config | include privilege 15** when a user account with access privilege set to level 15 is *not* present on the running configuration.  ```   Switch# show running-config | include privilege 15   Switch#   ```  The following example shows the output of the command **show running-config | include privilege 15** when a user account with access privilege set to level 15 is present on the running configuration. This device is *not* vulnerable:  ```   Switch# show running-config | include privilege 15   username  password encrypted  privilege 15   ```    **Note**: Some hardware/software combinations may not support the piping (“|”) of commands. In that case, use the command **show running-config** with no pipes and scan the output for the relevant configuration lines.  Additional information is available in the [Details](#details) section of this advisory. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + Cisco 200E Series Smart Switches   + Cisco 220 Series Smart Switches Cisco has also confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect devices running Cisco IOS Software, Cisco IOS XE Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software.  Details  * Cisco Small Business Switches are typically deployed within small office/home office (SOHO) network environments. The default configuration on the devices listed as vulnerable includes a default, privileged user account that is used for the initial login and cannot be removed from the system. An administrator may disable this account by configuring other user accounts with access privilege set to level 15. However, if all user-configured privilege level 15 accounts are removed from the device configuration, an affected software release re-enables the default privileged user account without notifying administrators of the system. Under these circumstances, an attacker can use this account to log in to an affected device and execute commands with full admin rights.  **Note**: The default user account is defined in a software-internal data structure and is not visible in either the running configuration or the startup configuration of an affected device.  Workarounds  * The workaround consists of adding at least one user account with access privilege set to level 15 in the device configuration. The following example shows how to configure an account by using *admin* as user ID, setting the access privilege to level 15, and defining the password by replacing  with a complex password chosen by the user. By adding this user account, the default privileged account will be disabled.    ```   Switch# configure terminal   Switch(config)# username admin privilege 15 password     ```    The command **show running-config | include privilege 15** will now produce the following output:  ```   Switch# show running-config | include privilege 15    username admin password encrypted  privilege 15   ```  Fixed Software  * Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability.  Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.  **Customers Without Service Contracts**  Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Fixed Releases Cisco has not released software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory.  Exploitation and Public Announcements  * The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability that is described in this advisory.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 9.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 9.8 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 9.8 |
