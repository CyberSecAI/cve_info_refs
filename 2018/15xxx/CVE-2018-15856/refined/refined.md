### Summary of CVE-2018-15856

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `compose/parser.c` file within the xkbcommon library. Specifically, the keymap parser can enter an infinite loop when it encounters an unexpected End-Of-Line (EOL) character while parsing a keymap file. This occurs when an unterminated keysym literal occurs at EOF

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Infinite Loop:** The core issue is the possibility of an infinite loop during the parsing of keymap files. This happens due to improper handling of the end-of-input condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a maliciously crafted keymap file. The infinite loop will lead to a denial of service, crashing the application that is using the `libxkbcommon` library.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attacker needs local access to the system to provide the crafted keymap file.
*   **Crafted Keymap File:** The attack vector involves supplying a specially crafted keymap file which triggers the infinite loop during parsing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs the ability to write a malicious keymap file to the local file system.
*   **Knowledge of File Locations:** Some of the documents discuss users providing keymap files, suggesting the attacker may need to know where to place such files to impact a target.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Component:** The vulnerability is in the `compose/parser.c` file, also referred to as the keymap parser.
*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects versions of `xkbcommon` before 0.8.1.
*   **Patch:** The fix was implemented in commit `842e4351c2c97de6051cab6ce36b4a81e709a0e1`

*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 5.5, which indicates a "Moderate" severity.

*  **CWE:** The vulnerability is associated with CWE-835, indicating a loop that does not terminate correctly.
