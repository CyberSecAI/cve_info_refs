The provided content includes information about CVE-2018-15732.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of validation of the output buffer address in the STOPzilla AntiMalware kernel driver. Specifically, IOCTLs 0x80002063 and 0x8000206F are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Arbitrary write vulnerability: The driver allows writing to an arbitrary memory location because it does not validate the output buffer address provided in the IOCTL call.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Privilege escalation: An attacker can overwrite the `_SEP_TOKEN_PRIVILEGES` structure to gain the `SeCreateTokenPrivilege` privilege. This can be further exploited to create a new privileged token, leading to arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges (local system).
-  On Windows 7, a SYSTEM shell can be obtained by switching to session 0.
- On Windows 10, the current user can be added to the local administrators group.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted IOCTL request to the STOPzilla AntiMalware kernel driver using IOCTL codes 0x80002063 and 0x8000206F.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the STOPzilla AntiMalware driver (szkg64.sys) and send IOCTL requests.
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
