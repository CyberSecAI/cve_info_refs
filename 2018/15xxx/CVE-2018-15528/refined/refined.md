Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-15528:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `select_sso()` function of the Java System Solutions SSO Plugin for BMC MyIT. The vulnerability arises from the plugin's failure to sanitize user-supplied input in the URL, specifically within the `arslogin` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected XSS: The application takes input from the URL (specifically the `arslogin` parameter) and reflects it back in the response without proper sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can inject client-side scripts into the context of the vulnerable application.
- This can lead to various attacks, including:
    - Session hijacking
    - Phishing
    - Defacement
    - Redirection to malicious sites
    - Stealing sensitive user information.

**Attack vectors:**
- A remote attacker crafts a malicious URL containing JavaScript code within the `arslogin` parameter.
- The victim is tricked into opening this malicious URL, which executes the injected script in their browser when they hit the "Login" button.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL and convince a user to visit the URL.
- No specific network position is needed beyond being able to send the link to a victim.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code snippet is within the `select_sso()` function:
  ```javascript
    function select_sso() {
      console.log('SSO login');
      id('loginForm').action= 'javascript:alert(%27Deloitte%20XSS%20PoC%27)';
      id('username').name= 'username';
      id('password').name= 'password';
      usingsso(true);
    }
  ```
- The `loginForm.action` is directly assigned a value from the `arslogin` parameter. This allows for arbitrary javascript execution.

**Proof of Concept:**
- The provided PoC URL is: `https://<hostname>/ux/jss-sso/arslogin?javascript:alert(%27Deloitte%20XSS%20PoC%27)`
- When a victim opens this URL and clicks the "Login" button, the injected JavaScript (`alert('Deloitte XSS PoC')`) is executed.

**Affected software:**
- Java System Solutions SSO Plugin 4.0.13.1 for BMC MyIT is explicitly mentioned. It's also noted that other versions might be affected.
