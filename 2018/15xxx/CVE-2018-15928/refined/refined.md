Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-15928:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds write in Adobe Acrobat and Reader.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds write: This type of vulnerability occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory boundary. This can overwrite adjacent memory regions and lead to unexpected behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user. This means an attacker could potentially gain full control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
The vulnerability is present in Adobe Acrobat and Reader, specifically within the processing of certain file formats. The specific attack vector would likely involve crafting a malicious PDF document that triggers the out-of-bounds write vulnerability when opened by a vulnerable version of the software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create or deliver a malicious PDF file.
- The attacker requires the user to open the malicious PDF with a vulnerable version of Adobe Acrobat or Reader.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information comes from a Check Point research paper on fuzzing Adobe Reader and an Adobe security bulletin.
- The Check Point paper describes how they used a fuzzer to find over 50 vulnerabilities, including this one. They created a harness for the JP2KLib.dll, which is responsible for parsing JPEG2000 images.
- The Adobe security bulletin confirms the existence of the vulnerability and states that it is critical and can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- The affected versions include various tracks of Adobe Acrobat and Reader DC and 2017, 2015.
- The advisory also lists other CVEs that were discovered during the same research.
