The provided content does not directly relate to CVE-2018-15573. It discusses CVE-2021-44153, an authenticated remote binary execution vulnerability in Reprise License Manager (RLM) 14.2. However, the content mentions that exploitation of CVE-2021-44153 does not require CVE-2018-15573. It does state that if CVE-2018-15573 remains unpatched, it could be used in conjunction with the remote code execution to write arbitrary files to the filesystem.

Here is the extracted information regarding CVE-2021-44153 from the provided content:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The RLM application allows an admin user to specify an arbitrary executable to run via the license file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unvalidated user-specified binary execution
- Lack of input sanitization

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by crafting a malicious license file.

**Attack vectors:**
- Modifying the license file to include a command that executes a malicious binary.
- The code execution occurs upon startup or when triggering the "Reread/Restart Servers" function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be an authenticated admin user of the RLM application.
