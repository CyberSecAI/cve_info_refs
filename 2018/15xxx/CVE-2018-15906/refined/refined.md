  "CVE-2018-15906": {
    "Description": "SolarWinds Serv-U FTP Server is vulnerable to privilege escalation from remote authenticated users by leveraging the CSV user import function. This leads to obtaining remote code execution under the context of the Windows SYSTEM account in a default installation.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the CSV user import functionality of SolarWinds Serv-U FTP server. This function can be abused to inject malicious event configurations.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient privilege check for user creation/modification via CSV import.",
      "Lack of input validation when importing user events from a CSV file.",
	  "Inability to properly restrict the configuration of event triggers by lower-level administrators."
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution with SYSTEM privileges on the server.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Remote, authenticated access via the Serv-U web interface.",
      "Abuse of the CSV user import functionality."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Valid credentials for a 'Domain Administrator' account or a similar role with write access to user accounts",
	  "Ability to upload files via web interface"
    ]
  }
