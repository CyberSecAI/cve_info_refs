### Why is Telerik JustDecompile Being Retired?

Empowering development teams to work with the most comprehensive toolset requires a periodical revision of Progress Developer Tools offerings. It goes both ways - adding new products to meet evolving business needs and retiring products that have served their purpose. Investing our efforts in the right direction ensures you get the most up-to-date solutions to boost productivity and elevate user experience.

## What Does Telerik JustDecompile Discontinuation Mean?

Progress Software discontinues Telerik JustDecompile future downloads. If you have downloaded the product, you can continue using it for as long as you wish. However, since April 2, 2024, no new downloads are available, Telerik JustDecompile is no longer offered or supported as part of Progress Developer Tools portfolio.

To continue building highly functional digital experiences, we invite you to check the other Progress Telerik and Kendo UI products.
