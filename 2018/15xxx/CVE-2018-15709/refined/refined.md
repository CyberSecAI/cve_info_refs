Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-15709:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the `cmdsubsys.php` script in Nagios XI. Specifically, the script is vulnerable to command injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-provided input when handling subsystem commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. The `cmdsubsys.php` script uses `system()` function to execute commands constructed from user-supplied data without proper sanitization.
- **Unsafe Deserialization:** The script deserializes user-provided data (`$command_data`) using `unserialize()` before constructing the command. This data is used to construct a shell command, leading to the injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the server with the privileges of the web server user (typically 'nagios'). This includes reading, modifying, or deleting files, installing software, or taking control of the system.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Although the vulnerability is initially exploited with the privileges of 'nagios' user, it could be combined with a privilege escalation vulnerability to gain root access.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to `ajaxhelper.php`. The `cmd` parameter is set to `submitcommand` with crafted `opts` parameter that include the vulnerable command (e.g., `COMMAND_NAGIOSXI_SET_HTACCESS` (1100)) and injected commands in the `password` field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated as a user of Nagios XI. This vulnerability can be exploited by low-privileged users, not just administrative users.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Nagios XI server to send HTTP requests.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable code is located within the `cmdsubsys.php` script, specifically when handling the `COMMAND_NAGIOSXI_SET_HTACCESS` command.
- The `$command_data` variable is deserialized, and its contents are used to construct a command line that is executed using `system()`.
- The `password` field from the deserialized data is directly inserted into the command line without proper escaping or sanitization.

**Proof of Concept:**

The provided proof of concept demonstrates how an attacker can inject commands into the `password` field, which results in arbitrary command execution by the ‘nagios’ user on the system:

```
https://192.168.1.208/nagiosxi/ajaxhelper.php?cmd=submitcommand&opts={%22cmd%22:1100,%22cmddata%22:{%22username%22:%22test%22,%22password%22:%22test%27%3bwhoami%20%3E%20/usr/local/nagiosxi/tmp/whoami.txt%3b%27%22},%22cmdtime%22:0,%22cmdargs%22:%22%22}&nsp=30a86418c0953be277b67c5149f9b4be762f08e14a92fcbece756922f5df2312
```
The attacker injects `whoami > /usr/local/nagiosxi/tmp/whoami.txt` to demonstrate the vulnerability.
