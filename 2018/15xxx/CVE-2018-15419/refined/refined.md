  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper validation of ARF and WRF files"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Sending a user a malicious ARF or WRF file via a link or an email attachment",
    "Persuading the user to open the file by using the affected software"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send a malicious file to a user and persuade the user to open it."
