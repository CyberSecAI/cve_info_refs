The provided content describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in MiniCMS.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `date` parameter within the `page.php` script.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the webpage.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the webpage
    - Stealing sensitive information
    - Redirecting the user to malicious websites

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL with a specifically crafted `date` parameter. The injection point is within the `page.php` script via the URL parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick a victim into visiting it (e.g. via a phishing link). No specific user privileges or position in the network are needed, just the ability to send a URL.
