  "CVE-2018-15631": {
    "Description": "In case the module Discussion is installed, a weakness in the module allows an authenticated attacker to send document for which he has no access to the outside. In the public channel available in the discussion module is it possible to turn on a feature allowing to send content of published messages to all channel participants ( except the sender ) by e-mail. If a message is posted with an attachment this attachment is also send by e-mail. The module in charge of e-mail sending does not perform the authorization checks to ensure the e-mail receipients have at least read access to the attachment.",
    "Root cause": "The email sending module does not perform authorization checks to ensure email recipients have at least read access to the attachment.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper access control",
      "Missing authorization checks"
    ],
    "Impact": "An authenticated attacker can send documents they don't have access to by email. This can lead to sensitive data exposure.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network exploitation",
      "Crafted RPC requests"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have an authenticated user account (internal or external) to exploit the vulnerability. They also need to be able to create records for the `mail.message` and `mail.mail` models."
