Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-15172:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow in the TP-Link WR840N router's firmware when handling a long `Authorization` header in an HTTP request.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer Overflow: Sending an overly long string in the `Authorization` header overflows a buffer in the device's memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Successful exploitation causes the router to automatically log out and lose its network connection, effectively rendering it unusable.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based: The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable router.
- HTTP Request Manipulation: The attacker needs to intercept and modify an HTTP request to include the malicious `Authorization` header.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network Access: The attacker must have network access to the targeted router. This typically means being connected to the router's Wi-Fi network.
- Packet Interception: The attacker needs to use a tool like Burp Suite to intercept and modify HTTP requests.
- Knowledge of Router Configuration: The attacker needs to know that the router is vulnerable to this specific vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The Exploit-DB entry provides a step-by-step proof-of-concept (PoC) on how to exploit this vulnerability using Burp Suite. The blog post by the author provides a visual guide with screenshots to perform the attack.
- The vulnerable firmware version is specified as `0.9.1 3.16 v0001.0 Build 170608 Rel.58696n`.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the router is in the "Quick setup" configuration stage, which is typically a first time setup scenario.
- A string of 2000 zeros in the `Authorization` header is enough to trigger the overflow.
- The exploit is categorized as a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.
