All installations must be upgraded to [Vanilla 2.6.1](https://open.vanillaforums.com/addon/vanilla-core-2.6.1) immediately. Please follow the upgrade instructions in the README.

Full release notes will follow shortly. This release contains multiple security patches, including a critical exploit that was publicly disclosed today. There are no new features or backwards-incompatible changes.

A security-only update to the 2.5 branch of Vanilla will also follow, in this same discussion.

  For those still running PHP 5.6, we've now released [Vanilla 2.5.3 - now 2.5.4](https://open.vanillaforums.com/addon/vanilla-core-2.5.4) with a patch for the disclosed vulnerability and a few other security patches.

  If you are able to run PHP 7.0+ we **strong recommend** you do so immediately and upgrade to 2.6.1 (above).

  I've released 2.5.4 and edited my post above. It contains a fix for a persistent but intermittent problem where a user would get a "Garden.Community.Manage" permission error while trying to post. It was introduced in a security patch back in 2.5.1 and I was able to track it down this evening.

  Again, please use the 2.6 branch if you're on PHP 7.0+. This issue was not present in that release.

  Upgraded. All seems to work except Single Sign Off. I had to take out this:

  $Configuration['Garden']['Authenticator']['SignOutUrl'] = '/entry/signout/{Session\_TransientKey}?Target=<http://www.mydomain.org/wp-login.php?action=logout'>;

  as it was causing an infinite loop.

  Cleared cookies, tried re-entering the trusted domains.... I could not solve SSO logout tonight.

  We have upgraded to 2.6.1. However we have noticed the category follow/unfollow is not working properly. I have selected "View" to "Following". Once it is done, I cannot go back to "All" mode. If try to select "All", it throws Error.

  I believe you need to update your `.htaccess` file if you're using Apache.

  Make a backup of your existing one, first.
