- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when processing request ID 0x2002 for IDAMSPMASTER in the `coreServiceShell.exe` service process. This can lead to a memory access beyond the allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability due to insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute code with SYSTEM privileges, leading to privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors**: Local attack vector. An attacker must be able to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
