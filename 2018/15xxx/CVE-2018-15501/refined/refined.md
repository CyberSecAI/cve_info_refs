{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `ng_pkt` function in `transports/smart_pkt.c` uses `strchr` to search for a space or newline character in a smart-protocol 'ng' packet. It does not validate that the character exists within the remaining length of the packet, which leads to an out-of-bounds read if the crafted packet lacks a null byte.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Improper input validation"
     ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can send a crafted smart-protocol 'ng' packet without a '\\0' byte which can lead to an out-of-bounds read, causing a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a crafted smart-protocol 'ng' packet without a '\\0' byte"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to send network packets"
    ],
    "additional_details": "The fix uses `memchr` to limit the search within the remaining length of the packet, and also verifies that enough bytes remain to find a match."
