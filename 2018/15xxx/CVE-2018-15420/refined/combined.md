"title": "Summary",
"text": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player for Microsoft Windows and the Cisco Webex Player for Microsoft Windows could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected system.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerabilities exist because the affected software improperly validates Advanced Recording Format (ARF) and Webex Recording Format (WRF) files. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a user a malicious ARF or WRF file via a link or an email attachment and persuading the user to open the file by using the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181003-webex-rce [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181003-webex-rce\"]"

"text": "Cisco Webex Business Suite services and Cisco Webex Meetings Online are hosted, multimedia conferencing solutions that are managed and maintained by Cisco Webex. Cisco Webex Meetings Server is a multimedia conferencing solution that customers host, manage, and maintain in their private clouds.\r\n\r\nCisco Webex Business Suite services can be configured to allow users to store meeting recordings online and download those recordings as ARF files. These services can also be configured to allow users to record meetings directly on their local computers as WRF files.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Webex Network Recording Player is the application that is used to play back ARF files. It is available from Cisco Webex Business Suite sites (WBS31, WBS32, and WBS33), Cisco Webex Meetings Online, and Cisco Webex Meetings Server. The player can be installed manually from the Cisco Webex website [\"https://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html\"] or automatically when a user accesses an ARF file for streaming playback from a Cisco Webex Business Suite site.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Webex Player is the application that is used to play back WRF files. It is available from Cisco Webex Business Suite sites (WBS31, WBS32, and WBS33) and Cisco Webex Meetings Online. It is not available from Cisco Webex Meetings Server.

"title": "Workarounds",
"text": "There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities. However, customers may remove the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player and the Cisco Webex Player from a system by using the software-removal procedure for the operating system. For example, to remove a player from a Microsoft Windows 10 system, customers can use the Apps & Features app in the Windows Settings app.\r\n\r\nTo remove all Cisco Webex software from a Microsoft Windows system, customers can use the Meeting Services Removal Tool, which is available for download from the Cisco Collaboration Help article, Cisco Webex and 3rd Party Support Utilities [\"https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/WBX000026396\"]."

"title": "Fixed Software",
"text": "Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n Fixed Versions\r\nCisco fixed these vulnerabilities in the following versions of the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player and the Cisco Webex Player:\r\n\r\nCisco Webex Business Suite WBS32 sites ��� Webex Network Recording Player and Webex Player Versions WBS32.15.30 and later\r\nCisco Webex Business Suite WBS33 sites ��� Webex Network Recording Player and Webex Player Versions WBS33.5 and later\r\nCisco Webex Meetings Online ��� Webex Network Recording Player and Webex Player Versions 1.3.39 and later\r\nCisco Webex Meetings Server ��� Webex Network Recording Player Versions 3.0MR2 Patch 1 and later\r\n\r\nCisco has not and will not fix all these vulnerabilities in Cisco Webex Business Suite WBS31 sites because those sites have reached the end-of-version-support milestone. For information about this milestone and the upgrade plans for WBS31 sites, see Cisco Webex Meetings Suite End-of-Version Support Policy [\"https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/ns12j0bb\"].\r\n\r\nCustomers can upgrade to a fixed version of the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player in either of two ways:\r\n\r\nAutomatically: The player will be automatically upgraded to the latest version of the software when a user accesses an ARF file that is hosted on a Cisco Webex Business Suite site (WBS32 or WBS33), Cisco Webex Meetings Online site, or Cisco Webex Meetings Server.\r\nManually: The player can be downloaded and installed from https://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html [\"https://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html\"].\r\n\r\nNote: Customers who use locked-down Cisco Webex sites will not receive updated versions of the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player automatically. These customers should contact Cisco Webex Customer Support to obtain updates or obtain the latest version of the player from https://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html [\"https://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html\"].\r\n\r\nCustomers can upgrade to a fixed version of the Cisco Webex Player by uninstalling their current version of the player and then downloading and installing the latest version of the player from https://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html [\"https://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html\"].\r\n\r\nThe following table lists the Cisco bug IDs and fixed versions of the software for each vulnerability that is described in this advisory.

The vulnerabilities exist because the affected software improperly validates Advanced Recording Format (ARF) and Webex Recording Format (WRF) files. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a user a malicious ARF or WRF file via a link or an email attachment and persuading the user to open the file by using the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:   <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181003-webex-rce>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products These vulnerabilities affect the following versions of the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player for Microsoft Windows and the Cisco Webex Player for Microsoft Windows, which are available from Cisco Webex Business Suite sites, Cisco Webex Meetings Online sites, and Cisco Webex Meetings Server:    + Cisco Webex Business Suite WBS31 sites - All Webex Network Recording Player and Webex Player versions prior to Version WBS31.23   + Cisco Webex Business Suite WBS32 sites - All Webex Network Recording Player and Webex Player versions prior to Version WBS32.15.30   + Cisco Webex Business Suite WBS33 sites - All Webex Network Recording Player and Webex Player versions prior to Version WBS33.5   + Cisco Webex Meetings Online - All Webex Network Recording Player and Webex Player versions prior to Version 1.3.39   + Cisco Webex Meetings Server - All Webex Network Recording Player versions prior to Version 3.0MR2 Patch 1 To determine which version of the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player or the Cisco Webex Player is installed on a system, users can open the player and choose **Help > About**.  **Note:** Customers should contact Cisco Webex Customer Support if they do not receive automatic software updates and are running a vulnerable software version that has reached the end-of-software-maintenance milestone. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Cisco has confirmed that these vulnerabilities do not affect the Apple Mac OS X or Linux versions of the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player or the Cisco Webex Player.  Details  * Cisco Webex Business Suite services and Cisco Webex Meetings Online are hosted, multimedia conferencing solutions that are managed and maintained by Cisco Webex. Cisco Webex Meetings Server is a multimedia conferencing solution that customers host, manage, and maintain in their private clouds.  Cisco Webex Business Suite services can be configured to allow users to store meeting recordings online and download those recordings as ARF files. These services can also be configured to allow users to record meetings directly on their local computers as WRF files.  The Cisco Webex Network Recording Player is the application that is used to play back ARF files. It is available from Cisco Webex Business Suite sites (WBS31, WBS32, and WBS33), Cisco Webex Meetings Online, and Cisco Webex Meetings Server. The player can be installed manually from the [Cisco Webex website](https://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html) or automatically when a user accesses an ARF file for streaming playback from a Cisco Webex Business Suite site.  The Cisco Webex Player is the application that is used to play back WRF files. It is available from Cisco Webex Business Suite sites (WBS31, WBS32, and WBS33) and Cisco Webex Meetings Online. It is not available from Cisco Webex Meetings Server. The player can also be installed manually from the [Cisco Webex website](https://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html).  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities. However, customers may remove the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player and the Cisco Webex Player from a system by using the software-removal procedure for the operating system. For example, to remove a player from a Microsoft Windows 10 system, customers can use the Apps & Features app in the Windows Settings app.  To remove all Cisco Webex software from a Microsoft Windows system, customers can use the Meeting Services Removal Tool, which is available for download from the Cisco Collaboration Help article, [Cisco Webex and 3rd Party Support Utilities](https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/WBX000026396).  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Fixed Versions Cisco fixed these vulnerabilities in the following versions of the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player and the Cisco Webex Player:    + Cisco Webex Business Suite WBS32 sites - Webex Network Recording Player and Webex Player Versions WBS32.15.30 and later   + Cisco Webex Business Suite WBS33 sites - Webex Network Recording Player and Webex Player Versions WBS33.5 and later   + Cisco Webex Meetings Online - Webex Network Recording Player and Webex Player Versions 1.3.39 and later   + Cisco Webex Meetings Server - Webex Network Recording Player Versions 3.0MR2 Patch 1 and later Cisco has not and will not fix all these vulnerabilities in Cisco Webex Business Suite WBS31 sites because those sites have reached the end-of-version-support milestone. For information about this milestone and the upgrade plans for WBS31 sites, see [Cisco Webex Meetings Suite End-of-Version Support Policy](https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/ns12j0bb).  Customers can upgrade to a fixed version of the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player in either of two ways:    + **Automatically:** The player will be automatically upgraded to the latest version of the software when a user accesses an ARF file that is hosted on a Cisco Webex Business Suite site (WBS32 or WBS33), Cisco Webex Meetings Online site, or Cisco Webex Meetings Server.   + **Manually:** The player can be downloaded and installed from <https://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html>. **Note:** Customers who use locked-down Cisco Webex sites will not receive updated versions of the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player automatically. These customers should contact Cisco Webex Customer Support to obtain updates or obtain the latest version of the player from <https://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html>.  Customers can upgrade to a fixed version of the Cisco Webex Player by uninstalling their current version of the player and then downloading and installing the latest version of the player from <https://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html>.  The following table lists the Cisco bug IDs and fixed versions of the software for each vulnerability that is described in this advisory.

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 7.8 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 7.8 |
