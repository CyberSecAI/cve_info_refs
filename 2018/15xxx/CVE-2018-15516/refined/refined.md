{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The FTP server component of the D-LINK Central WifiManager (CWM-100) allows the use of the PORT command to perform bounce scans.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure FTP server configuration",
      "Lack of input validation on PORT command parameters"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can use the vulnerable FTP server as a man-in-the-middle to conduct network port scans, disguising the origin of the scans. This can lead to misattribution of malicious activity.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can send commands to the FTP server on the default port 9000 to conduct port scans.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable D-LINK Central WifiManager device and its FTP server. Default credentials ('admin'/'admin') are used."
