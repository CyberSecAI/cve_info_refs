Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-15394:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an insecure system configuration in the Cisco Stealthwatch Management Console (SMC).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Authentication bypass: The primary vulnerability is that an attacker can bypass authentication mechanisms.
- Insecure system configuration: The root cause lies in an insecure configuration of the system.
- Lack of input validation on crafted HTTP requests: The system is vulnerable to crafted HTTP requests, which leads to the bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthenticated access: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain access to the SMC without authentication.
- Elevated privileges: The attacker gains administrative privileges in the SMC.
- Arbitrary action execution: Once authenticated with administrative privileges, the attacker can execute arbitrary actions on the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attacker: The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
- Network-based attack: The attack is carried out by sending crafted HTTP requests over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Unauthenticated access: The attacker does not need to have valid credentials to launch the attack.
- Network access: The attacker needs network connectivity to the targeted system to send crafted HTTP requests.

**Summary:**
CVE-2018-15394 describes a critical authentication bypass vulnerability in the Cisco Stealthwatch Management Console. It stems from an insecure system configuration that allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain administrative privileges by sending crafted HTTP requests, leading to arbitrary action execution. The vulnerability is fixed in Cisco Stealthwatch Enterprise Release 6.10.3 and later, along with patches for earlier affected versions (6.7, 6.8, 6.9).
