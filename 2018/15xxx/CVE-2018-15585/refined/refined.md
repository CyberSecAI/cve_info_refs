Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed in the commit:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically the `nw_subject` field in the `newwinform.php` and `newwinformupdate.php` files. The code was directly using the POST parameter `nw_subject` to update the database without sanitizing it, making the application vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the `nw_subject` field, which would then be stored in the database and executed in the browsers of other users who view the popup.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Script Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Data theft
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirection to malicious websites
    - Other malicious activities

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the admin interface (`/adm/newwinform.php`) where an attacker with admin privileges could craft a malicious `nw_subject` payload and submit it to `newwinformupdate.php`.
- The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator to access the vulnerable admin interface

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrator Access:** The attacker needs to have administrator-level access to the GnuBoard system to modify the popup settings.

**Technical Details:**
- The commit log message "XSS 취약점 수정" clearly indicates the nature of the fix.
- The diff for `adm/newwinform.php` shows that `stripslashes()` is replaced by `get_sanitize_input()` for the `nw_subject` field.
- The diff for `adm/newwinformupdate.php` introduces sanitization for `$nw_subject` using `strip_tags()` before using it in the SQL query.
- Similar sanitization changes are made across multiple files including `boardgroup_form_update.php`, `boardgroup_list_update.php`, `contentformupdate.php`, `faqmasterformupdate.php`, `point_update.php`, `num_book_update.php` and `num_book_write.php` to address XSS vulnerabilities in other admin inputs as well.
