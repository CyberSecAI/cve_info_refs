Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-15536:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a path traversal issue during the unpacking of archives within the Responsive FileManager application. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize or validate file paths contained within the archive, allowing an attacker to specify directory traversal sequences like `../` within the archive's file paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal (ZipSlip):** The core vulnerability is a path traversal issue which occurs when extracting the contents of a ZIP archive.  The application allows the inclusion of  `../` sequences within the file paths contained in the archive. This allows the extraction of files to locations outside of the intended directory, leading to arbitrary file creation/overwrite.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite:** Attackers can create files in arbitrary locations on the server's filesystem by crafting malicious ZIP archives. This includes potentially overwriting existing files if they have the necessary permissions.
*   **Potential Remote Code Execution:** Although the vulnerability itself doesn't directly lead to RCE, the ability to create files with "legal" extensions can potentially be chained to achieve remote code execution in cases where the server runs with high privileges. For example, creating cron jobs may be possible.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious ZIP Archive:** The attack vector involves uploading a specially crafted ZIP archive containing file paths with directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`).
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerable `ajax_calls.php` endpoint's `extract` action is triggered by a POST request with the parameter `path` set to the name of the uploaded ZIP archive.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Upload Files:** An attacker needs the ability to upload a file (the crafted ZIP archive) to the affected web server and to trigger the extraction process.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable web server.

**Additional details:**

* The provided content indicates that the vulnerability was fixed in version 9.13.4 of Responsive FileManager.
*   The exploit is a classic ZipSlip vulnerability.
*   The content provides a base64 encoded example of a malicious ZIP file which creates a file named `source.txt` in the `/tmp/` directory.

**Summary**
The vulnerability allows an attacker to create and overwrite files in arbitrary locations of the server by crafting a malicious ZIP archive, potentially leading to remote code execution.
