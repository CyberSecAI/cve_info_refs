The provided content relates to CVE-2018-15871.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by an invalid memory address dereference within the `getString` function, triggered by the `decompileSingleArgBuiltInFunctionCall` function in the `libming` library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Invalid memory address dereference: The `getString` function attempts to dereference a pointer that points to an invalid memory location (specifically, address 0x000000000020 in the provided ASAN output).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability leads to a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV) and termination of the program. This can result in a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through processing a specially crafted SWF file that triggers the vulnerable code path.
- Specifically, when `swftocxx` parses the malicious SWF file, it crashes within the `getString` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a malicious SWF file as input to the `swftocxx` utility. This could involve having the target user process the attacker's crafted SWF file.
- The attacker needs the ability to execute the `swftocxx` tool using a malicious SWF file.
