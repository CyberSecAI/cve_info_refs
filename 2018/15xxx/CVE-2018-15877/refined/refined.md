  "description": "The Plainview Activity Monitor WordPress plugin is vulnerable to OS command injection. It passes unsafe user-supplied data to the 'ip' parameter in activities_overview.php. Although privileges are required, the plugin is also vulnerable to CSRF and Reflected XSS. These vulnerabilities combined can lead to Remote Command Execution with an admin click on a malicious link.",
