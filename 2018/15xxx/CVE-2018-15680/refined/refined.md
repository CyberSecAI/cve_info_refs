Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-15680:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Passwords in the `xbtit_users` table are stored as unsalted MD5 hashes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Hashing:**  The use of unsalted MD5 for password storage is a significant weakness. MD5 is a fast hashing algorithm, and without a salt, it's vulnerable to precomputed rainbow table attacks and brute force attempts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Password Reversal:** If an attacker gains access to the database, they can easily reverse the MD5 hashes to obtain the original user passwords. This can lead to unauthorized access to user accounts and potential data breaches.
*  **Brute-Force:** Even with strong passwords, the lack of salting allows for relatively quick brute-force attempts compared to more robust hashing methods.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Database Compromise:** An attacker needs access to the database to retrieve the password hashes, which could happen if there is an SQL injection or other vulnerability in the web application that allows access to the database, or if the server is compromised.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Database Access:** The attacker needs to be able to retrieve the contents of the `xbtit_users` table from the database.
*  **Basic Cryptography Knowledge:**  The attacker needs a basic understanding of hashing and a tool like hashcat to perform attacks.

**Additional Information:**

*   The content suggests that while XBTIT has an option to select different hashing schemes, it doesn't seem to work properly in version 2.5.4.  It also mentions a possible workaround by manually editing the database.
* The content shows the result of a SQL query that confirms the use of unsalted MD5 hashes.
