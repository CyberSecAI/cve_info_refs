The provided content is related to CVE-2018-15582.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in multiple files within the `adm` directory of the gnuboard5 project. Specifically, the code was directly using `$_POST` variables in SQL queries without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability present is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The code was vulnerable to XSS attacks due to the lack of proper sanitization of user inputs. Several files were identified that were vulnerable to this issue including `adm/boardgroup_form_update.php`, `adm/boardgroup_list_update.php`, `adm/contentformupdate.php`, `adm/faqmasterformupdate.php`, `adm/newwinformupdate.php`, `adm/point_update.php`, `adm/sms_admin/num_book_update.php` and `adm/sms_admin/num_book_write.php` . The commit addresses this by using the `strip_tags()` function to sanitize the input before using it in queries or displaying the content.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the application via the vulnerable input fields. This could lead to various impacts such as:
- Session hijacking
- Defacement of the web application
- Redirecting the victim to a malicious website
- Stealing sensitive information, such as user credentials or other data.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the web interface, specifically via the administrative forms. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code via input fields including:
- `gr_subject` in `adm/boardgroup_form_update.php` and `adm/boardgroup_list_update.php`
- `co_subject`, `co_include_head`, `co_include_tail` in `adm/contentformupdate.php`
- `fm_subject`, `fm_head_html`, `fm_tail_html` in `adm/faqmasterformupdate.php`
- `nw_subject` in `adm/newwinformupdate.php`
- `mb_id`, `po_point`, `po_content` in `adm/point_update.php`
- `bk_name` in `adm/sms_admin/num_book_update.php` and `adm/sms_admin/num_book_write.php`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker would need to have access to the administrative interface to exploit these vulnerabilities, which implies that the attacker needs some level of access to the back-end part of the application.
