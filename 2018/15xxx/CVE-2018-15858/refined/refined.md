Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-15858:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `CopyKeyAliasesToKeymap` function within `xkbcomp/keycodes.c`.
- Specifically, it arises when the function receives invalid aliases, leading to a scenario where `num_key_aliases` remains zero.
- Despite `num_key_aliases` being zero, the code proceeds to loop through the aliases, which are never allocated, resulting in a null-pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The primary vulnerability is the dereferencing of a NULL pointer. This occurs when the code attempts to access `key_aliases[i].alias` and `key_aliases[i].real` without ensuring that `key_aliases` has been allocated (which it isn't if `num_key_aliases` is zero).
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code fails to properly validate the input aliases, specifically the number of key aliases. When it's zero, the subsequent logic that assumes allocated memory is flawed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Exploitation of this vulnerability results in a crash due to the NULL pointer dereference. This can lead to a denial of service, affecting the availability of the system or application using the vulnerable `libxkbcommon` library.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** A local attacker with the ability to provide a crafted keymap file can trigger the vulnerability. The attacker must have the ability to cause the vulnerable code path to be executed (e.g., user interaction with an application that loads keymaps).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker requires local access to the system.
- **Ability to Supply a Crafted Keymap File:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted keymap file that triggers the code path with invalid aliases.
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker does not need high level privileges on the system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability involves ensuring that the alias copy operation only occurs if `num_key_aliases` is greater than 0. This prevents the null pointer dereference if the aliases are invalid.
- The vulnerability is present in `libxkbcommon` versions prior to 0.8.1.
- The vulnerability can be triggered via the XKB text format parser
- The vulnerability affects Ubuntu 16.04 ESM, Ubuntu 14.04 ESM and Ubuntu 18.04 ESM.
- The vulnerability has a moderate severity rating with a CVSS score of 5.5.
