Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is the combination of two vulnerabilities:

1.  **PowerGrid /SEE command line argument vulnerability:** The `PowerGrid` application (`pwrgrid.exe`) in Ivanti Workspace Control allows execution of arbitrary commands via the `/SEE` command line option. It takes an XML file as input and executes commands specified within that XML file.
2.  **FileGuard bypass:**  A separate vulnerability allows bypassing the FileGuard minifilter driver, which protects the `WMTemp` folder.  This bypass allows an attacker to create arbitrary XML files within the `WMTemp` folder, which is usually restricted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted Command Execution via `/SEE`:** The `PowerGrid` application does not properly validate or sanitize the commands specified in the XML files it processes using the `/SEE` command line argument.
*   **FileGuard Bypass:** The ability to circumvent the `FileGuard` mini filter allows for writing of arbitrary files into the WMTemp folder.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** `PowerGrid` doesn't validate commands specified within the XML files before executing them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Application Whitelisting Bypass:** An attacker can bypass the application whitelisting mechanism provided by Ivanti Workspace Control.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By creating a malicious XML file and using `PowerGrid` with the `/SEE` argument, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the target machine.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Although not explicitly stated, successful exploitation could lead to privilege escalation if the attacker executes malicious code with higher privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker requires local access to the target system, specifically the ability to execute code.
*   **Command Line:** The attack is carried out via the command line, by invoking the `pwrgrid.exe` application with the `/SEE` argument and a path to the malicious XML file.
*   **Malicious XML File:** The attacker must create a malicious XML file containing the command to be executed. This file needs to be placed in the `WMTemp` folder.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a valid local user account on the targeted Windows system.
*   **Ability to execute code:** The attacker needs the ability to execute a command on the system.
*   **Exploitable Workspace Control Installation:** The system must be running a vulnerable version of Ivanti Workspace Control (prior to 10.3.0.0).
*   **Knowledge of the FileGuard bypass:** The attacker needs to know how to exploit the secondary vulnerability that allows creating files within the WMTemp folder.
