We can't easily diagnose this error without them. Would you please attach the grafana logs mentioned here ? <http://docs.grafana.org/installation/troubleshooting/#logging>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1653273#c6)  Christina Meno    2018-11-27 16:19:55 UTC  ``` Maybe blocker, we are investigating now   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1653273#c7)  Boris Ranto    2018-11-27 23:06:10 UTC  ``` I could reproduce locally and I do consider this a blocker. This is happening when you deploy 3.1 cephmetrics (based on grafana 5.0.0) and then you re-run the playbook with grafana 5.3.2 image that we want to ship in 3.2.  It looks like, the best bet for us will be to roll back the new image version. I could reproduce this with upstream images as well and it is an internal grafana issue (nil pointer dereference) somewhere in the grafana code. It is also reproducible with the latest version 5.3.4 image.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1653273#c8)  Boris Ranto    2018-11-28 00:18:13 UTC  ``` My upstream testing shows that this is a regression in grafana 5.3.x. The upgrade to grafana 5.2.4 works fine for me. I will do a new downstream grafana build for 5.2.4. It should contain all the necessary security fixes while still being upgradeable from 5.0.0.  btw: Based on my testing, even the password prompt to change the default password that was broken in 5.3.2 ([bz1652427](show_bug.cgi?id=1652427 "CLOSED ERRATA - [ceph-metrics]Change password is not working")) works fine in 5.2.4.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1653273#c10)  Boris Ranto    2018-11-28 01:54:28 UTC  ``` The container build:  <https://brewweb.engineering.redhat.com/brew/taskinfo?taskID=19300192>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1653273#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-01-03 17:44:53 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# Grafana 5.2.3 and 4.6.4 released with important security fix

[![Torkel Ãdegaard](/static/img/about/torkel_odegaard.jpg?w=58)](/author/torkel/)

[Torkel Ãdegaard](/author/torkel/)

---

Today we are releasing Grafana 5.2.3 and Grafana 4.6.4. These patch releases includes a very important security fix for all Grafana installations which are configured to use LDAP or OAuth authentication.

Latest stable release in 5.x:

* [Download Grafana 5.2.3](/grafana/download/5.2.3)
* [Release notes](https://community.grafana.com/t/release-notes-v5-2-x/7894)

Latest stable release in 4.x:

* [Download Grafana 4.6.4](/grafana/download/4.6.4)
* [Release notes](https://community.grafana.com/t/release-notes-v4-6-x/3179)

## LDAP & OAuth login vulnerability (CVE-2018-558213)

On the 20th of August at 1800 CEST we were contacted about a potential security issue with the âremember meâ cookie Grafana sets upon login. The issue targeted users without a local Grafana password (LDAP & OAuth users) and enabled a potential attacker to generate a valid cookie knowing only a username. We immediately recognized the high severity of this vulnerability and quickly developed a patch for 5.x and 4.x.

### Affected versions

Grafana releases 2.0 through 5.2.2 are affected by this vulnerability. All instances
on [Grafana Cloud](/cloud) have already been updated to 5.2.3.

### Solutions and mitigations

All installations which use the Grafana LDAP or OAuth authentication features must be upgraded as soon as possible. If you cannot upgrade, you should switch authentication mechanisms or put additional protections in front of Grafana such as a reverse proxy.

**CVE ID**: CVE-2018-558213

We would like to thank Sebastian Solnica for reporting this issue.

### Timeline and postmortem

Here is a detailed timeline starting from when we originally learned of the issue. This is the first significant security issue that Grafana Labs has dealt with; we have used this incident as an opportunity to learn from, and will be improving our incident response going forward.

* 20 Aug 2018 1800 CEST
  + Torkel Ãdegaard received request via twitter DM for contact details
  + Received details of vulnerability from Sebastian Solnica 1 hour later
* 21 Aug 2018 08:00 CEST
  + Confirmed issue and began developing a fix.
  + Fix required a minor new feature in db migration system so commit message did not mention that it had any security implications.
  + Backported fix to 5.2.x branch
* 22 Aug 2018 11:00 CEST
  + Researched vulnerability disclosure handling
  + Started preparing 5.2.3 release
* 22 Aug 2018 20:33 CEST
  + Got outside counsel on how to handle vulnerability fixes. Learned that itâs best to request CVE, prepare fix in private, and to give non-public heads up to customers, distributions, etc while maintaining strict public embargo until release time.
  + Requested & received CVE ID CVE-2018-558213
  + Started preparations to handle future vulnerabilities better
* 23 Aug 2018
  + Started rolling out 5.2.3 to Grafana Cloud customers
  + Worked on backport of fix for old 4.6.x release branch.
  + Decided on making release public on Wed Aug 29 13:00 CEST. The date was chosen to give people time to prepare and not run into the weekend. The time was chosen to fall into main work time of the EU and US while still giving Asia a fair chance to react.
* 23 Aug 2018 22:05 CEST
  + Proactively contacted Grafana Enterprise customers with details and download links.
  + Completed rollout of 5.2.3 to Grafana Cloud.
* 29 Aug 2018 13:00 CEST
  + Publish of release & this blog post.

## Future considerations

We are not sure if omitting the security nature of the change in the commit message was correct or not. Apache [VULNERABILITY HANDLING](https://www.apache.org/security/committers.html#vulnerability-handling) guidelines state: â*No reference should be made to the commit being related to a security vulnerability*.â

We did do a private release that we circulated beforehand but the fix (and tag of v5.2.3) was then already in the public repo. The ordering here was obviously wrong. If doing a private release before going public, the fix should also stay private.

We are also putting in new processes for submitting and handling security incidents as you can see in the next section.

## Reporting security Issues

If you think you have found a security vulnerability please send a report to security@grafana.com. This address can be used for all of
Grafana Labs’s open source and commercial products (including but not limited to Grafana, Grafana Cloud, Grafana Enterprise, and grafana.com). We can accept only vulnerability reports at this address. We would prefer if you encrypted your message to us, please use our PGP key. The key fingerprint is

`F988 7BEA 027A 049F AE8E 5CAA D125 8932 BE24 C5CA`

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1624088#c0)  Laura Pardo    2018-08-30 22:11:09 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in Grafana 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x before 4.6.4 and 5.x before 5.2.3 allows authentication bypass because an attacker can generate a valid "remember me" cookie knowing only a username of an LDAP or OAuth user.   References: <https://grafana.com/blog/2018/08/29/grafana-5.2.3-and-4.6.4-released-with-important-security-fix/>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1624088#c1)  Siddharth Sharma    2018-08-31 11:11:04 UTC  ``` Reading code following seem to be fixes for this  For 5.2.x: <https://github.com/grafana/grafana/commit/df83bf10a225811927644bdf6265fa80bdea9137> For 4.6.x: <https://github.com/grafana/grafana/commit/7baecf0d0deae0d865e45cf03e082bc0db3f28c3>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1624088#c4)  Siddharth Sharma    2018-09-07 06:22:37 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  As per upstream (<https://grafana.com/blog/2018/08/29/grafana-5.2.3-and-4.6.4-released-with-important-security-fix>)  * Switch to authentication mechanism other than LDAP or OAuth * Grafana should be isolated from public networks   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1624088#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-12-17 17:06:21 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.4 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2018:3829 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3829](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A3829)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1624088#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-01-03 17:44:51 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ceph Storage 3.2  Via RHSA-2019:0019 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0019](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A0019)   ``` |  |
