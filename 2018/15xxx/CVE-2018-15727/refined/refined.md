    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Authentication bypass due to insecure cookie generation.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can bypass authentication and gain access to the Grafana system by creating a valid session cookie using a known username.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote, by forging a 'remember me' cookie.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Knowledge of a valid username, network access to the Grafana instance."
