Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is improper validation of user-controlled data passed to the Uplay desktop client's custom `uplay` URI protocol handler. The client uses Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) and doesn't properly sanitize or validate command-line arguments passed via the URI. This allows an attacker to inject Chromium flags, specifically the `--GPU-launcher` flag, to execute arbitrary commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **URI Parsing Command Injection:** The Uplay client fails to validate arguments passed via the custom URI protocol handler, specifically the `%1` argument in the command line.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The client doesn't sanitize special characters (quotes, backslashes) present in the URI, allowing command injection.
*   **Vulnerable CEF Integration:** The integration of CEF within the Uplay client makes it susceptible to exploitation via Chromium command-line switches.
*   **ShellExecute Misuse:** The vulnerability relies on how `ShellExecute` handles parameters with non-encoded spaces, quotes and backslashes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.
*   **Compromise of User's Machine:** Successful exploitation leads to full compromise of the victim's system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Webpages:** An attacker can embed a malicious `uplay` URI on a webpage.
*   **Malicious Links:** An attacker can send a specially crafted link to the victim.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Position:** The attacker does not need to be physically present on the victim's machine.
*   **Webserver or communication channel:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage or send a crafted link to the victim.
*   **User interaction:** The victim needs to click the malicious link or visit the webpage and consent to open the uplay application through the browser prompt.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit uses the `--GPU-launcher` flag in Chromium to execute commands.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when the custom protocol handler for `uplay://` URIs is invoked.
*   The exploit can be triggered through both webpage loading and hyperlink clicks within Microsoft Edge.
*   While the UplayService.exe process attempts to run with elevated privileges (potentially triggering a UAC prompt), the command execution is triggered prior to the UAC prompt in upc.exe, and is therefore not prevented by the user choosing to deny the prompt.
*  The vulnerability is present in Uplay desktop client version 63.0.5699.0
