Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Ivanti Workspace Control service exposes a Named Pipe for communication.
*   Normally, only the `Composer` process (`pfwsmgr.exe`) is intended to connect to this Named Pipe.
*   A local attacker can bypass this restriction.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Named Pipe Access:** The service does not properly restrict access to its Named Pipe, allowing unauthorized processes to connect.
*   **Lack of Input Validation/Authorization:** The service does not properly validate or authorize the commands received through the Named Pipe.
*   **Privilege Escalation via Dynamic Privileges:** The `Dynamic Privileges` feature, designed to grant temporary admin rights to applications, can be abused to launch arbitrary commands with elevated privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A local, unprivileged attacker can execute arbitrary commands with `Administrator` privileges.
*   This allows an attacker to fully compromise the workstation.
*   If application whitelisting is enabled, an attacker needs to first find a method to execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the machine running Ivanti Workspace Control.
*   **Process Injection:** The attacker spawns a new `Composer` process and injects a malicious thread into it.
*   **Named Pipe Communication:** The injected thread connects to the service's Named Pipe.
*   **Command Injection:** The thread sends a command to the service via the Named Pipe to launch an attacker-defined application with elevated privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Local user account with low privileges.
*   Ability to spawn new processes and inject threads.
*   Knowledge of the Named Pipe's name and the command structure expected by the service.

**Affected Versions:**

*   Ivanti Workspace Control versions 10.2.700.1 & 10.2.950.0.

**Resolution:**

*   This issue was resolved in Ivanti Workspace Control version 10.3.10.0.
