The provided content is related to CVE-2018-15584. This commit addresses an XSS vulnerability in the gnuboard5 project by sanitizing user inputs before using them in SQL queries, or outputting to the page.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability and fix:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before it is used in SQL queries or displayed on a web page. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application that will then be executed by a victim's browser when the attacker's injected data is displayed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application was vulnerable to XSS attacks. By not sanitizing user-supplied input in various admin forms (board group, content, FAQ, new window, point update, and SMS admin number book), an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code.
*   **SQL Injection:** Although not explicitly stated, the commit also mitigates the risk of SQL injection by preventing unsanitized data from being directly used in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **XSS:**
    *   An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, allowing them to perform actions such as:
        *   Stealing session cookies, leading to account compromise.
        *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
        *   Defacing the website.
        *   Performing actions on behalf of the victim.
*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   An attacker could potentially modify or delete data, gain unauthorized access, or disrupt the application's operations

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Admin Forms:** The attacker would need to gain access to the admin panels of the application. Once there, an attacker can inject malicious scripts through the vulnerable fields in the admin forms.
    *   `adm/boardgroup_form.php`, `adm/boardgroup_form_update.php`, `adm/boardgroup_list_update.php`
    *   `adm/contentform.php`, `adm/contentformupdate.php`
    *   `adm/faqmasterform.php`, `adm/faqmasterformupdate.php`
    *   `adm/newwinform.php`, `adm/newwinformupdate.php`
    *    `adm/point_update.php`
    *  `adm/sms_admin/num_book_update.php`,  `adm/sms_admin/num_book_write.php`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Access to Admin Panel:** The attacker must have administrative privileges or find a way to exploit a vulnerability to gain access to the administrative interface.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Input Fields:** The attacker needs to know which input fields in the admin interface are vulnerable to XSS or SQL injection attacks.

**Fix:**
The fix implemented in this commit involves the following:
*   **Input Sanitization:** The code now uses `strip_tags()` to remove HTML and PHP tags from user input. The `get_sanitize_input` is also used. This prevents the injection of malicious scripts.
*   **SQL query sanitization:** User input is sanitized before being included in the SQL queries, which helps prevent SQL injection.
