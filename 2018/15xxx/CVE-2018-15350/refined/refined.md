- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Kraftway-24F2XG router uses default credentials, which allows remote attackers to gain administrative privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of default credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated remote attacker can gain full administrative access to the router. This includes the ability to read sensitive information, modify settings, and disrupt services.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have network access to the router, but does not need any prior privileges or user interaction.
