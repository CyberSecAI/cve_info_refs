Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-15881

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Inadequate checks regarding disabled custom fields.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- ACL (Access Control List) Violation. This means that users might be able to access or manipulate data they shouldn't have access to based on their permissions. Specifically, the checks for disabled fields are insufficient, allowing potential bypass of access restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Low impact is stated in the document. However, it can lead to unauthorized access to custom fields, potentially allowing an attacker to view or manipulate sensitive data, depending on the nature of the custom fields.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  The attack vector is through the Joomla CMS's custom fields functionality, by manipulating the system in a way that disabled fields are still accessed or modified.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be a user with some level of access to the Joomla instance to exploit the ACL violation. The required level of access is not explicitly stated in the description, but it must be sufficient to interact with the custom field functionality.

**Affected Versions:**
- Joomla! CMS versions 3.7.0 through 3.8.11 are affected.

**Solution:**
- Upgrade to Joomla! CMS version 3.8.12

**Additional Notes:**
- The severity is marked as "Low".
- The vulnerability was reported on 2018-July-10 and fixed on 2018-August-28.
