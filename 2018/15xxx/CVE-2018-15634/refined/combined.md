## Description

[![@odony](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2039870?v=4&size=48)](/odony)[odony](https://github.com/odony)opened [on Dec 22, 2020](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/63702#issue-773033341)
# Security Advisory - [CVE-2018-15634](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v44r-mggx-92j8 "CVE-2018-15634")

**Affects**: Odoo 14.0 and earlier (Community and Enterprise Editions)

**CVE ID**: [CVE-2018-15634](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15634)

**Component**: Framework

**Credits**: Nathanael ROTA (Capgemini) and Alessandro Innocenti

Cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in attachment management in Odoo Community

14.0 and earlier and Odoo Enterprise 14.0 and earlier, allows remote

attackers to inject arbitrary web script in the browser of a victim via a

crafted link.

## I. Background

The system supports attaching files directly on any database record.

## II. Problem Description

The attributes of the attachments were not properly controlled.

This is a different vulnerability than [CVE-2018-15633](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15633)

## III. Impact

**Attack Vector**: Network exploitable

**Authentication**: No user account required

**CVSS3 Score**: High :: 7.1

**CVSS3 Vector**: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

A remote attacker could craft a special URL link and trick a user into

visiting it, in order to execute arbitrary web script in their browser.

This could lead to privilege escalation and execution of actions using the

session of the other victim.

Odoo S.A. is not aware of any use of this vulnerability in the wild.

## IV. Workaround

There is no known workaround, applying the patches is strongly recommended.

Odoo Cloud servers have been patched as soon as the correction was available.

## V. Solution

Apply the patches corresponding to your Odoo installation, or upgrade

to the latest revision, either via GitHub or by downloading the

latest version from <https://www.odoo.com/page/download>

or <http://nightly.odoo.com>

To apply the patch, change into the main directory of your Odoo

installation (the one containing "openerp" and "addons" directories),

then execute the patch command, typically:

```
   patch -p0 -f < /path/to/the_patch_file.patch

```

This command assumes your installation layout corresponds to

the latest source code layout of the Odoo project on GitHub.

If your installation differs, please extract the various patch

hunks from the files and apply them in the appropriate locations.

## VI. Correction details

The following list contains the revisions after which the vulnerability

is corrected:

* 11.0: [2c1f39a](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/2c1f39aca38b10803d1378e6d5730a908fcdbff2)
* 12.0: [4aeb006](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/4aeb006f1ee6f55a84867c0c497807275ff2ab0a)
* 13.0: [1fefdda](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/1fefddaed8ed5017f3435abf26e54b6bfbe2c3ea)
* 14.0: [88e5d2d](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/88e5d2df8d8d56881003320cbebaf95ed9ca7101)
* 14.0-ent, 13.0-ent, 12.0-ent and 11.0-ent (Enterprise): see 14.0, 13.0,

  12.0 and 11.0.

## Description

[![@odony](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2039870?v=4&size=48)](/odony)[odony](https://github.com/odony)opened [on Dec 22, 2020](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/63702#issue-773033341)
# Security Advisory - [CVE-2018-15634](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v44r-mggx-92j8 "CVE-2018-15634")

**Affects**: Odoo 14.0 and earlier (Community and Enterprise Editions)

**CVE ID**: [CVE-2018-15634](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15634)

**Component**: Framework

**Credits**: Nathanael ROTA (Capgemini) and Alessandro Innocenti

Cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in attachment management in Odoo Community

14.0 and earlier and Odoo Enterprise 14.0 and earlier, allows remote

attackers to inject arbitrary web script in the browser of a victim via a

crafted link.

## I. Background

The system supports attaching files directly on any database record.

## II. Problem Description

The attributes of the attachments were not properly controlled.

This is a different vulnerability than [CVE-2018-15633](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15633)

## III. Impact

**Attack Vector**: Network exploitable

**Authentication**: No user account required

**CVSS3 Score**: High :: 7.1

**CVSS3 Vector**: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

A remote attacker could craft a special URL link and trick a user into

visiting it, in order to execute arbitrary web script in their browser.

This could lead to privilege escalation and execution of actions using the

session of the other victim.

Odoo S.A. is not aware of any use of this vulnerability in the wild.

## IV. Workaround

There is no known workaround, applying the patches is strongly recommended.

Odoo Cloud servers have been patched as soon as the correction was available.

## V. Solution

Apply the patches corresponding to your Odoo installation, or upgrade

to the latest revision, either via GitHub or by downloading the

latest version from <https://www.odoo.com/page/download>

or <http://nightly.odoo.com>

To apply the patch, change into the main directory of your Odoo

installation (the one containing "openerp" and "addons" directories),

then execute the patch command, typically:

```
   patch -p0 -f < /path/to/the_patch_file.patch

```

This command assumes your installation layout corresponds to

the latest source code layout of the Odoo project on GitHub.

If your installation differs, please extract the various patch

hunks from the files and apply them in the appropriate locations.

## VI. Correction details

The following list contains the revisions after which the vulnerability

is corrected:

* 11.0: [2c1f39a](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/2c1f39aca38b10803d1378e6d5730a908fcdbff2)
