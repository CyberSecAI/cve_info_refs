The vulnerabilities exist because the affected software improperly validates Advanced Recording Format (ARF) and Webex Recording Format (WRF) files. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a user a malicious ARF or WRF file via a link or an email attachment and persuading the user to open the file by using the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:   <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181003-webex-rce>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products These vulnerabilities affect the following versions of the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player for Microsoft Windows and the Cisco Webex Player for Microsoft Windows, which are available from Cisco Webex Business Suite sites, Cisco Webex Meetings Online sites, and Cisco Webex Meetings Server:    + Cisco Webex Business Suite WBS31 sites - All Webex Network Recording Player and Webex Player versions prior to Version WBS31.23   + Cisco Webex Business Suite WBS32 sites - All Webex Network Recording Player and Webex Player versions prior to Version WBS32.15.30   + Cisco Webex Business Suite WBS33 sites - All Webex Network Recording Player and Webex Player versions prior to Version WBS33.5   + Cisco Webex Meetings Online - All Webex Network Recording Player and Webex Player versions prior to Version 1.3.39   + Cisco Webex Meetings Server - All Webex Network Recording Player versions prior to Version 3.0MR2 Patch 1 To determine which version of the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player or the Cisco Webex Player is installed on a system, users can open the player and choose **Help > About**.  **Note:** Customers should contact Cisco Webex Customer Support if they do not receive automatic software updates and are running a vulnerable software version that has reached the end-of-software-maintenance milestone. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Cisco has confirmed that these vulnerabilities do not affect the Apple Mac OS X or Linux versions of the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player or the Cisco Webex Player.  Details  * Cisco Webex Business Suite services and Cisco Webex Meetings Online are hosted, multimedia conferencing solutions that are managed and maintained by Cisco Webex. Cisco Webex Meetings Server is a multimedia conferencing solution that customers host, manage, and maintain in their private clouds.  Cisco Webex Business Suite services can be configured to allow users to store meeting recordings online and download those recordings as ARF files. These services can also be configured to allow users to record meetings directly on their local computers as WRF files.  The Cisco Webex Network Recording Player is the application that is used to play back ARF files. It is available from Cisco Webex Business Suite sites (WBS31, WBS32, and WBS33), Cisco Webex Meetings Online, and Cisco Webex Meetings Server. The player can be installed manually from the [Cisco Webex website](https://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html) or automatically when a user accesses an ARF file for streaming playback from a Cisco Webex Business Suite site.  The Cisco Webex Player is the application that is used to play back WRF files. It is available from Cisco Webex Business Suite sites (WBS31, WBS32, and WBS33) and Cisco Webex Meetings Online. It is not available from Cisco Webex Meetings Server. The player can also be installed manually from the [Cisco Webex website](https://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html).  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities. However, customers may remove the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player and the Cisco Webex Player from a system by using the software-removal procedure for the operating system. For example, to remove a player from a Microsoft Windows 10 system, customers can use the Apps & Features app in the Windows Settings app.  To remove all Cisco Webex software from a Microsoft Windows system, customers can use the Meeting Services Removal Tool, which is available for download from the Cisco Collaboration Help article, [Cisco Webex and 3rd Party Support Utilities](https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/WBX000026396).  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Fixed Versions Cisco fixed these vulnerabilities in the following versions of the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player and the Cisco Webex Player:    + Cisco Webex Business Suite WBS32 sites - Webex Network Recording Player and Webex Player Versions WBS32.15.30 and later   + Cisco Webex Business Suite WBS33 sites - Webex Network Recording Player and Webex Player Versions WBS33.5 and later   + Cisco Webex Meetings Online - Webex Network Recording Player and Webex Player Versions 1.3.39 and later   + Cisco Webex Meetings Server - Webex Network Recording Player Versions 3.0MR2 Patch 1 and later Cisco has not and will not fix all these vulnerabilities in Cisco Webex Business Suite WBS31 sites because those sites have reached the end-of-version-support milestone. For information about this milestone and the upgrade plans for WBS31 sites, see [Cisco Webex Meetings Suite End-of-Version Support Policy](https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/ns12j0bb).
