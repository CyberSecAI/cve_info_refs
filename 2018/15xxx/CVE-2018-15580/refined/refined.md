The provided content is a commit diff from a GitHub repository, which contains fixes for XSS vulnerabilities.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerabilities is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before being used in HTML context. Specifically, the code uses `$_POST` variables directly in SQL queries or output them directly to the HTML without proper escaping/sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the presence of XSS vulnerabilities due to the lack of sanitization of user inputs. Unfiltered user input injected into HTML can allow malicious scripts to be executed in the browser of users visiting affected pages.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **XSS:** If an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, they could perform various actions on behalf of the user, such as:
  - Stealing session cookies
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites
  - Defacing the website
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user
  - Accessing sensitive information

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP POST requests where user-controlled data is sent via form submissions (e.g., board group creation/update, content creation/update, etc).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to submit crafted HTTP POST requests with malicious code in the form fields. Usually, this can be done by any user with access to admin forms if the filtering is not correctly performed.

**Specific files and changes:**
The commit diff shows changes in multiple files, all aiming at sanitizing user input. The main changes involve using functions like `strip_tags()` and `get_sanitize_input()` to filter potentially malicious code before using it in SQL queries or HTML output. Some files and specific changes include:

- `adm/boardgroup_form_update.php`: Added `strip_tags()` to sanitize `$_POST['gr_subject']` before using it in the SQL query.
- `adm/boardgroup_list_update.php`:  Added `strip_tags()` to sanitize `$_POST['gr_subject'][$k]` before using it in the SQL query.
- `adm/contentformupdate.php`: Added `strip_tags()` to sanitize `$co_subject` before use.
- `adm/faqmasterformupdate.php`: Added `strip_tags()` to sanitize `$fm_subject` before use.
- `adm/newwinform.php`: Changed the `stripslashes()` to `get_sanitize_input()` function for the  `nw_subject` input field.
- `adm/newwinformupdate.php`:  Added `strip_tags()` to sanitize `$_POST['nw_subject']` before using it in the SQL query.
- `adm/point_update.php`: Added `strip_tags()` to sanitize `$_POST['mb_id']`, `$_POST['po_point']` and `$_POST['po_content']`.
- `adm/sms_admin/num_book_update.php`: Added `strip_tags()` to sanitize `$bk_name`.
- `adm/sms_admin/num_book_write.php`: Changed  output of `bk_name`  to `get_sanitize_input` function.

The changes consistently apply sanitization to user-provided input before its insertion into SQL queries or use in HTML, effectively addressing the reported XSS vulnerabilities.
