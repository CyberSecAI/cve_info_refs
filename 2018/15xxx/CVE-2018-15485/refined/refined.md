Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-15485:

**CVE-2018-15485: FTP without authentication and authorization**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The KONE Group Controller (KGC) has an FTP service enabled on port 21 that lacks any authentication or authorization mechanisms.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**:
    *   **Unauthenticated FTP Access**: The primary vulnerability is the lack of authentication on the FTP service. This allows anyone who can connect to the service to access it without providing credentials.
    *   **Unauthorized Access**: Since there is no authentication, there is also no authorization. This means any user can perform any available FTP operation.

*  **Impact of Exploitation**:
   *   An attacker could use the unauthenticated FTP access to read or modify any files accessible via the FTP service.
   * This could lead to unauthorized modification of the system's configuration or potentially further compromise it using other vulnerabilities.

*   **Attack Vectors**:
    *   **Network-based**: The attacker needs network access to the KGC's LAN. This is typically a dedicated network for the elevator group controller and related systems but could be connected to other building systems through a firewall.
    *  **Physical Access:** While not directly related to the FTP vulnerability, the document also mentions that physical access to the KGC would enable an attacker to bypass all network protections and exploit the device.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   The attacker needs to be on the same LAN as the KONE Group Controller (KGC).
    *   No specific user privileges or credentials are required for exploiting the FTP vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**

*   The document explicitly states that the vulnerabilities do not directly affect elevator safety, but can disrupt their operation by interfering with the group control functionality.
*   The provided text mentions that other vulnerabilities exist in the same KGC system (CVE-2018-15484, CVE-2018-15486, CVE-2018-15483).
*   The vulnerabilities are fixed in KGC software version 4.6.5 where HTTP and FTP services are disabled by default.
*   The report explicitly mentions that the vulnerability was reported by Sebastian Neuner (@sebastian9er) of Google Security Team.
