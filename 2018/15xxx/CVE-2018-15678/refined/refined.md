The provided content is related to CVE-2018-15678.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `act` parameter in the signup page at `/index.php?page=signup` is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application fails to properly sanitize the 'act' parameter in the signup page, allowing the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser by crafting a malicious URL. This can lead to stealing session cookies, hijacking user accounts, performing actions on behalf of the user, and other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker can craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload in the `act` parameter and trick a user into accessing it. The attacker can use social engineering or other methods to distribute the malicious link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to convince an authenticated user to click a malicious link. The user does not need to be on the signup page directly. The vulnerability exists in the signup page but is triggered by the crafted URL.
