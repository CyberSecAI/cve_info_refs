Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security issues:

**Issue 1: Unauthorized Access (Issue #2)**

*   **Root Cause:** The `addpage.php` file within the `simple-cms` application can be accessed without prior authentication as an administrator. This indicates a missing or improperly implemented authentication check.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Lack of proper access control on sensitive administrative functions.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Unauthenticated users can add pages to the CMS, potentially leading to content manipulation, defacement, or further malicious activities through injected content.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Direct access to the `addpage.php` URL.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable `simple-cms` instance.

**Issue 2: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (Issue #3)**

*   **Root Cause:** The application lacks CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to induce an authenticated admin user to perform unwanted actions (e.g., adding a page) via a crafted request.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Missing CSRF protection mechanism.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can use a crafted HTML page or link to execute unauthorized actions on the `simple-cms` application, such as creating new pages, on behalf of an authenticated administrator.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML file containing a form that submits a request to the vulnerable `addpage.php` endpoint. The attacker would then trick an authenticated user to visit this page.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to lure an authenticated admin user into clicking on the malicious link or html file, and have access to a way to host the malicious file, like a web server, or a shared file system.

**Summary of vulnerabilities identified:**

*   **Missing Access Control:** The `addpage.php` script lacks authentication, allowing anyone to add pages.
*  **CSRF Vulnerability:** The application does not implement CSRF protection, enabling attackers to forge requests on behalf of logged-in users.
