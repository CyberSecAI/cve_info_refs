Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-15486:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The KONE Group Controller (KGC) web interface allows for unauthenticated local file modification, specifically the `autoexec.bat` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Unauthenticated local file modification:** The web interface does not require authentication to modify files on the system. This allows an attacker to overwrite system files.
*   **Local File Inclusion:** While not explicitly stated as a direct LFI vulnerability, the ability to write to arbitrary files (including system configuration files like `autoexec.bat`) effectively acts as a method of achieving file inclusion as it allows control of files executed by the system.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** By modifying the `autoexec.bat` file, an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary operating system commands when the system boots. This allows for full control over the affected system.
*   **System Compromise:** This can be further leveraged to gain persistent access to the KGC system and potentially the connected network.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface of the KGC. Access to the web interface is required.
*   **Local Network:** The attacker must be on the same LAN as the KGC, which is typically in a physically secured location such as an elevator machine room.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the KGC system (same LAN).
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any credentials to exploit this vulnerability via the web interface.
