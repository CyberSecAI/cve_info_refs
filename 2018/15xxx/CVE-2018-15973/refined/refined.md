- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw in Adobe Experience Manager.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to sensitive information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could inject malicious scripts that are stored within the application. When a user interacts with the stored script, it executes in their browser, potentially exposing sensitive information.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need the ability to inject malicious scripts into the application's storage.
