    "description": "The Ghostscript suite contains utilities for rendering PostScript and PDF documents. Ghostscript translates PostScript code to common bitmap formats so that the code can be displayed or printed.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* ghostscript: shading_param incomplete type checking (699660) (CVE-2018-15909)\n\nIt was discovered that the ghostscript .shfill operator did not properly validate certain types. An attacker could possibly exploit this to bypass the -dSAFER protection and crash ghostscript or, possibly, execute arbitrary code in the ghostscript context via a specially crafted PostScript document.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Incomplete type checking in the `shading_param` function of Ghostscript, which is used to handle shading parameters in PostScript files. Specifically, the `.shfill` operator did not properly validate certain types.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation",
        "Type confusion"
      ],
       "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Ghostscript process by crafting a malicious PostScript document.",

        "Malicious PostScript file"
