  "CVE-2018-15594": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `paravirt_patch_call/jump()` functions in `arch/x86/kernel/paravirt.c` in the Linux kernel mishandle certain indirect calls.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Mishandling of indirect calls. Incorrect clobber test in `paravirt_patch_call()`.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can more easily conduct Spectre-v2 attacks against paravirtualized guests by exploiting the mishandling of indirect calls.",
    "Attack vectors": "Exploitation of a vulnerability in the paravirtualization implementation of the Linux kernel.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user within a paravirtualized guest."
