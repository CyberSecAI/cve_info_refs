Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A security vulnerability exists in Avaya Aura® Communication Manager that allows an administrative user to escalate their privileges. The specifics of the underlying cause are not detailed, however.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Privilege Escalation: An existing administrative user can gain higher levels of access within the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Full system compromise could be possible, as the vulnerability allows an attacker to escalate privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required, as specified by the "AV:L" (Local) vector in the CVSSv3 string.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must already have administrative-level access to the system, as indicated by "PR:H" (High Privileges) in the CVSSv3 string, and need user interaction "UI:R" (Required).
- The attack has a high complexity "AC:H".
- The vulnerability requires user interaction "UI:R".

**CVSS Score:**
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 6.3 (Medium).
- The CVSSv3 vector string is: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
    - AV:L (Attack Vector: Local)
    - AC:H (Attack Complexity: High)
    - PR:H (Privileges Required: High)
    - UI:R (User Interaction: Required)
    - S:U (Scope: Unchanged)
    - C:H (Confidentiality Impact: High)
    - I:H (Integrity Impact: High)
    - A:H (Availability Impact: High)

**Affected Products:**
- Avaya Aura® Communication Manager versions 6.3.x and 7.0 through 7.1.3.

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to version 7.1.3.1 or later.
- Implement network security best practices, such as firewalls, ACLs, and physical security.
- Implement additional restrictions based on the customer's security policies.
