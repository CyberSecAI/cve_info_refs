Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-15667:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Airmail 3 for Mac application registers and uses the `airmail://` URL scheme. The "send" command within this scheme allows external applications to send emails from an active account without requiring authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Inadequate Access Control:** The `airmail://` URL scheme handler lacks proper access controls, allowing any application to invoke the "send" command and send emails.
- **Lack of User Prompt:** The handler processes the "send" command without prompting the user for confirmation, allowing emails to be sent silently.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Email Sending:** An attacker can craft a malicious email and send it from the user's email account without their knowledge or consent.
- **Potential for Phishing/Malware Distribution:** Attackers can leverage this vulnerability to send phishing emails or emails with malicious attachments to the user's contacts, increasing the spread of malicious campaigns.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Hyperlinks:** An attacker can embed a crafted `airmail://` URL within a link in an email, a website, or other document, and when clicked, it can trigger sending a malicious email from the user's account.
- **External Application:** Any application capable of invoking the URL handler can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to create a crafted `airmail://` URL:** The attacker must be able to generate a URL with the desired "send" command and parameters (e.g., recipients, body, and attachments)
- **Ability to trigger the execution of the crafted URL:** The attacker must induce the user to click a link or have an application automatically invoke the crafted URL handler.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to send emails from a target's Airmail account, giving them the potential to distribute phishing attempts or malicious attachments.
