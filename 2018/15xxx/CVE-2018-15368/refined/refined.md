Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-15368:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper sanitization of command arguments within the Cisco IOS XE Software CLI parser. This lack of sanitization allows modifications to the underlying Linux filesystem.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The core issue is the failure to properly validate or sanitize command arguments before processing them.
- **Command Injection:** By crafting specific arguments, an attacker can inject malicious commands that are then executed by the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Root Shell Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain access to the underlying Linux shell of the affected device.
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary commands with *root* privileges on the device, leading to a complete compromise.
- **System Modification:** An attacker can modify the filesystem due to root access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the device.
- **CLI Interface:** Exploitation is performed through the device's CLI using specially crafted arguments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Privileged EXEC Mode (Level 15):** The attacker needs privileged EXEC mode access (privilege level 15) on the targeted Cisco IOS XE device.
- **CLI Access:** The attacker must be able to interact with the device's command-line interface.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in multiple versions of Cisco IOS XE Software.
- There are no known workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this issue.

**CVSS Score:**
- Base Score: 6.7 (Medium severity)
- Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
- The CVSS vector indicates:
    - **AV:L (Attack Vector: Local)**
    - **AC:L (Attack Complexity: Low)**
    - **PR:H (Privileges Required: High)**
    - **UI:N (User Interaction: None)**
    - **S:U (Scope: Unchanged)**
    - **C:H (Confidentiality Impact: High)**
    - **I:H (Integrity Impact: High)**
    - **A:H (Availability Impact: High)**
