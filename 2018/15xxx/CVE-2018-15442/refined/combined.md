"text": "A vulnerability in the update service of Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary commands as a privileged user.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by invoking the update service command with a crafted argument. An exploit could allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands with SYSTEM user privileges.\r\n\r\nWhile the CVSS Attack Vector metric denotes the requirement for an attacker to have local access, administrators should be aware that in Active Directory deployments, the vulnerability could be exploited remotely by leveraging the operating system remote management tools.\r\n\r\n Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nAfter an additional attack method was reported to Cisco, the previous fix for this vulnerability was determined to be insufficient. A new fix was developed, and the advisory was updated on November 27, 2018, to reflect which software releases include the complete fix.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181024-webex-injection [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181024-webex-injection\"]"

This is also documented in the article Check the Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App Version [\"https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/0usc4ab\"].\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco Webex Productivity Tools is installed on a Windows machine, users can right-click the Webex Productivity Tools icon on the Windows taskbar and select About from the menu; a popup window displaying the currently installed version will open.

"text": "Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n Fixed Releases Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App (Cisco Webex Meetings Suite WBS33)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is fixed in Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App Release 33.6.4 and later releases.\r\n\r\nUsers can update the Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App by launching the Cisco Webex Meetings application and clicking the gear icon in the top right of the application window and then choosing the Check for Updates entry from the drop-down list. This is also documented in the article Update the Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App [\"https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/n1kwkd6\"].\r\n\r\nAdministrators can update the Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App for their user base by following the instructions available in the document IT Administrator Guide for Mass Deployment of the Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App [\"https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/nulpixd\"].\r\n Cisco Webex Productivity Tools (Cisco Webex Meetings Suite WBS32, WBS31)\r\nCisco Webex Productivity Tools is an optional companion application that allows users to quickly schedule and join meetings from their desktop without the need to access the Meetings website. The application should not be confused with the Cisco Webex Meetings Client, which is the main client application that provides the core functionality to host or attend a Webex meeting. Cisco Webex Productivity Tools has been replaced with Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App since Cisco Webex Meetings Release 33.2.0.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is fixed in Cisco Webex Productivity Tools Release 33.0.6 and later.\r\n\r\n Users can update the Cisco Webex Productivity Tools by launching the Cisco Webex Meetings application and clicking Settings in the top right of the application window and then choosing Check for Updates from the drop-down list. This is documented in more detail in the article Check for Cisco Webex Productivity Tools Updates for Windows [\"https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/nk758tr\"].\r\n\r\nAdministrators can update the Cisco Webex Productivity Tools for their user base by following the instructions available in the document IT Administrator Guide for Mass Deployment of the Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App [\"https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/nulpixd\"]."

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  After an additional attack method was reported to Cisco, the previous fix for this vulnerability was determined to be insufficient. A new fix was developed, and the advisory was updated on November 27, 2018, to reflect which software releases include the complete fix.  This advisory is available at the following link:   <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181024-webex-injection>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects all Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App releases prior to 33.6.4, and Cisco Webex Productivity Tools Releases 32.6.0 and later prior to 33.0.6, when running on a Microsoft Windows end-user system.  To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App is installed on a Windows machine, users can launch the Cisco Webex Meetings application and click the gear icon in the top right of the application window, then choose the **About...** menu entry; a popup window displaying the currently installed version will open. This is also documented in the article [Check the Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App Version](https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/0usc4ab).  To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco Webex Productivity Tools is installed on a Windows machine, users can right-click the Webex Productivity Tools icon on the Windows taskbar and select **About** from the menu; a popup window displaying the currently installed version will open. This is also documented in the article [Check the Cisco Webex Productivity Tools Version for Windows](https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/nf387ab). Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:      <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.  **Customers Without Service Contracts**  Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Fixed Releases**Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App (Cisco Webex Meetings Suite WBS33)**   This vulnerability is fixed in Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App Release 33.6.4 and later releases.  Users can update the Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App by launching the Cisco Webex Meetings application and clicking the gear icon in the top right of the application window and then choosing the **Check for Updates** entry from the drop-down list. This is also documented in the article [Update the Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App](https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/n1kwkd6).  Administrators can update the Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App for their user base by following the instructions available in the document [IT Administrator Guide for Mass Deployment of the Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App](https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/nulpixd). Cisco Webex Productivity Tools (Cisco Webex Meetings Suite WBS32, WBS31) Cisco Webex Productivity Tools is an optional companion application   that allows users to quickly schedule and join meetings from their desktop   without the need to access the Meetings website. The application should not be confused   with the Cisco Webex Meetings Client, which is the main client   application that provides the core functionality to host or attend a   Webex meeting. Cisco Webex Productivity Tools has been replaced with Cisco Webex   Meetings Desktop App since Cisco Webex Meetings Release 33.2.0.  This vulnerability is fixed in Cisco Webex Productivity Tools Release 33.0.6 and later.  Users can update the Cisco Webex Productivity Tools by launching the Cisco Webex Meetings application and clicking **Settings** in the top right of the application window and then choosing **Check for Updates** from the drop-down list. This is documented in more detail in the article [Check for Cisco Webex Productivity Tools Updates for Windows](https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/nk758tr).  Administrators can update the Cisco Webex Productivity Tools for their user base by following the instructions available in the document [IT Administrator Guide for Mass Deployment of the Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App](https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/nulpixd).  Exploitation and Public Announcements  * The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is aware that proof-of-concept exploit code is available for the vulnerability described in this advisory. The Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any malicious use of the vulnerability that is described in this advisory.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 7.8 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 7.8 |
