  "CVE-2018-15862": {
    "description": "Unchecked NULL pointer usage in LookupModMask in xkbcomp/expr.c in xkbcommon before 0.8.2 could be used by local attackers to crash (NULL pointer dereference) the xkbcommon parser by supplying a crafted keymap file with invalid virtual modifiers.",
    "vulnerability": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an unchecked NULL pointer usage within the `LookupModMask` function located in `xkbcomp/expr.c`. This occurs when processing a crafted keymap file containing invalid virtual modifiers.",

      "impact": "A local attacker can cause a denial of service by crashing the xkbcommon parser.",
      "attack_vector": "Local. The attacker needs to provide a crafted keymap file.",
