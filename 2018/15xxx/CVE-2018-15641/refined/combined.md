## Description

[![@odony](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2039870?v=4&size=48)](/odony)[odony](https://github.com/odony)opened [on Dec 22, 2020](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/63704#issue-773033386)
# Security Advisory - [CVE-2018-15641](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j8r2-275f-f2p3 "CVE-2018-15641")

**Affects**: Odoo 11.0 through 14.0 (Community and Enterprise Editions)

**CVE ID**: [CVE-2018-15641](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15641)

**Component**: Framework

**Credits**: msg systems ag, Lauri Vakkala (Silverskin),

Bharath Kumar (Appsecco), Anıl Yüksel, Aitor Fuentes (kr0no)

Cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in web module in Odoo Community 11.0

through 14.0 and Odoo Enterprise 11.0 through 14.0, allows remote

authenticated internal users to inject arbitrary web script in the

browser of a victim via crafted calendar event attributes.

## I. Background

The calendar component of the Odoo framework provides a calendar view and personal

and shared calendars.

## II. Problem Description

A programming error in the calendar view causes improper input sanitization of

calendar event attributes.

## III. Impact

**Attack Vector**: Network exploitable

**Authentication**: "Employee" user account required

**CVSS3 Score**: Medium :: 6.3

**CVSS3 Vector**: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

An attacker with an Employee / Internal user account could craft a special

calendar event and then trick another user into viewing it, in order to execute

arbitrary web script in their browser. This could lead to privilege escalation

and execution of actions using the session of the other user.

Odoo S.A. is not aware of any use of this vulnerability in the wild.

## IV. Workaround

There is no known workaround, applying the patches is strongly recommended.

Odoo Cloud servers have been patched as soon as the correction was available.

## V. Solution

Apply the patches corresponding to your Odoo installation, or upgrade

to the latest revision, either via GitHub or by downloading the

latest version from <https://www.odoo.com/page/download>

or <http://nightly.odoo.com>

To apply the patch, change into the main directory of your Odoo

installation (the one containing "openerp" and "addons" directories),

then execute the patch command, typically:

```
   patch -p0 -f < /path/to/the_patch_file.patch

```

This command assumes your installation layout corresponds to

the latest source code layout of the Odoo project on GitHub.

If your installation differs, please extract the various patch

hunks from the files and apply them in the appropriate locations.

## VI. Correction details

The following list contains the revisions after which the vulnerability

is corrected:

* 11.0: [3f06c22](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/3f06c220bf0d8f4fa0ee8f5135a358ae26b26aab)
* 12.0: [7a54f8a](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/7a54f8a214b17dc55f37387aa69f0d01fd06f0e9)
* 13.0: [8f094a1](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/8f094a1aa4e380705bd198741f451430d3c5e31d)
* 14.0: [2876991](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/2876991646fdc8373f64f63764923001fe7746b4)

## Description

[![@odony](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2039870?v=4&size=48)](/odony)[odony](https://github.com/odony)opened [on Dec 22, 2020](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/63704#issue-773033386)
# Security Advisory - [CVE-2018-15641](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j8r2-275f-f2p3 "CVE-2018-15641")

**Affects**: Odoo 11.0 through 14.0 (Community and Enterprise Editions)

**CVE ID**: [CVE-2018-15641](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15641)

**Component**: Framework

**Credits**: msg systems ag, Lauri Vakkala (Silverskin),

Bharath Kumar (Appsecco), Anıl Yüksel, Aitor Fuentes (kr0no)

Cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in web module in Odoo Community 11.0

through 14.0 and Odoo Enterprise 11.0 through 14.0, allows remote

authenticated internal users to inject arbitrary web script in the

browser of a victim via crafted calendar event attributes.

## I. Background

The calendar component of the Odoo framework provides a calendar view and personal

and shared calendars.

## II. Problem Description

A programming error in the calendar view causes improper input sanitization of

calendar event attributes.

## III. Impact

**Attack Vector**: Network exploitable

**Authentication**: "Employee" user account required

**CVSS3 Score**: Medium :: 6.3

**CVSS3 Vector**: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

An attacker with an Employee / Internal user account could craft a special

calendar event and then trick another user into viewing it, in order to execute

arbitrary web script in their browser. This could lead to privilege escalation

and execution of actions using the session of the other user.

Odoo S.A. is not aware of any use of this vulnerability in the wild.

## IV. Workaround

There is no known workaround, applying the patches is strongly recommended.

Odoo Cloud servers have been patched as soon as the correction was available.

## V. Solution

Apply the patches corresponding to your Odoo installation, or upgrade

to the latest revision, either via GitHub or by downloading the

latest version from <https://www.odoo.com/page/download>

or <http://nightly.odoo.com>

To apply the patch, change into the main directory of your Odoo

installation (the one containing "openerp" and "addons" directories),

then execute the patch command, typically:

```
   patch -p0 -f < /path/to/the_patch_file.patch

```

This command assumes your installation layout corresponds to

the latest source code layout of the Odoo project on GitHub.

If your installation differs, please extract the various patch

hunks from the files and apply them in the appropriate locations.

## VI. Correction details

The following list contains the revisions after which the vulnerability

is corrected:

* 11.0: [3f06c22](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/3f06c220bf0d8f4fa0ee8f5135a358ae26b26aab)
* 12.0: [7a54f8a](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/7a54f8a214b17dc55f37387aa69f0d01fd06f0e9)
