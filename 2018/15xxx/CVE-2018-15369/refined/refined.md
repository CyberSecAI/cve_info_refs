Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-15369:

**1. Root Cause of the Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of crafted TACACS+ response packets within the TACACS+ client subsystem of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation/handling of TACACS+ response packets.
- Lack of proper security checks for crafted packets

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can cause an affected Cisco device to reload, leading to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition.

**4. Attack Vectors:**
- **Injected Packet:** An attacker can inject a crafted TACACS+ packet into an existing TACACS+ session between an affected device and a TACACS+ server.
- **Impersonated Server:** An attacker can impersonate a legitimate TACACS+ server and send a crafted TACACS+ packet to an affected device when establishing a new connection.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to communicate with the targeted Cisco device.
- **TACACS+ Secret:** The attacker needs to know the shared TACACS+ secret used between the device and the legitimate TACACS+ server.
- **Valid TACACS+ Request:** The attacker must send the crafted TACACS+ packet in response to a valid TACACS+ request initiated by the targeted device (acting as a client).

**Additional Notes:**
- There are no known workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability affects Cisco devices running vulnerable releases of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software and are configured as TACACS+ clients.
- Cisco has released software updates to address the issue.
- The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
