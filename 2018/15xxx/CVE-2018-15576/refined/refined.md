```
{
  "CVE-2018-15576": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to the insecure use of unserialize() function on user-controlled data within the 'Encryptor.php' file. An attacker can pass a crafted serialized object to the application, which when unserialized, allows for arbitrary PHP code execution.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Insecure deserialization",
      "Remote code execution"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve remote code execution on the target server, leading to complete compromise of the application and the underlying system.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through sending a specially crafted serialized PHP object as part of a cookie to the vulnerable application.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must know the encryption key used by the application to encrypt the cookie. This key could potentially be exposed through a separate vulnerability, such as a debug setting."
