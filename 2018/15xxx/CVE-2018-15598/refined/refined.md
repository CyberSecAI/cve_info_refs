  "vulnerability": {
    "cveID": "CVE-2018-15598",
    "description": "The provided content details a fix for CVE-2018-15598 in Traefik, a modern reverse proxy. This vulnerability involved the API of Traefik exposing sensitive information, including ACME private keys, via HTTP requests. This was addressed by removing TLS from the API endpoint and adding warnings in the documentation regarding the API's exposure.",
    "affected_component": "Traefik API",
    "root_cause": "The Traefik API was accessible over HTTP (without TLS), allowing potential eavesdropping or interception of sensitive data.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Exposure of sensitive information (ACME private keys)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive configuration data and ACME private keys, which could be used to impersonate the server or other malicious purposes.",
    "attack_vector": "Accessing the API endpoint via HTTP. The API port might be publicly exposed if not properly restricted.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need network access to the Traefik API endpoint. If the API is publicly accessible, an attacker on the internet could exploit this.  If the API is only accessible on a restricted network an attacker on the internal network would be able to exploit this vulnerability.",
    "fixes": [
      "Removal of TLS from the API endpoint.",
       "Added documentation with warnings about the risks of enabling the API without proper security measures, recommending the use of HTTP Basic Authentication and restricting network access to the API port."
    ],
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability was fixed in version v1.6.6 of Traefik. The related pull requests include #3788 (removing TLS from the API), #3790 (adding documentation warnings), and issues #3651 and #3669, which discuss the related security concerns. There was also a related fix in PR #3616 which removed an unusable flag."
