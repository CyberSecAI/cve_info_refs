Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2018-15564:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

**Root Cause:** The `simple-cms` application lacks CSRF protection. The application allows deletion of pages using GET requests, without requiring any CSRF token or verification.

**Weaknesses:**
- Lack of CSRF protection: The application does not implement any mechanism to prevent CSRF attacks.
- Vulnerable action using GET requests: The deletion of pages is triggered by a GET request.

**Attack Vector:**
1. An attacker crafts a malicious URL (e.g., `<http://192.168.2.129/simple/admin/?delpage=8>`) that, when visited by an authenticated administrator, will delete a page.
2. The attacker can use social engineering or other means to trick the administrator into clicking the malicious URL or visiting a webpage that automatically loads the malicious URL (e.g. using an `<img>` tag).
3. The administrator's browser will send the request to the server, including the user's session cookies, triggering the page deletion, without the administrator's explicit consent or awareness.
4. The attacker can shorten the malicious URL to disguise the purpose.

**Impact:**
- Unauthorized page deletion: An attacker can delete arbitrary pages on the website if an administrator visits a malicious URL while being authenticated.
- Data loss: Pages can be deleted without the admin's knowledge or authorization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to know the URL structure for page deletion.
- The attacker needs to be able to trick an authenticated administrator into clicking a malicious URL or visiting a page that makes the malicious request.
- The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability; they only need the targeted administrator to be authenticated on the affected `simple-cms` instance.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided issue details show a concrete example of the vulnerability being exploited by a crafted URL.
- The vulnerability does not seem to be limited to a specific page; any page can be deleted by changing the value of `delpage`.
- The attack can be performed using various methods, such as a malicious email or a webpage.
