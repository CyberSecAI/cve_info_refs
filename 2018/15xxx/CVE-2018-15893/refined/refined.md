Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically the `keywords` parameter, which is directly incorporated into an SQL query in `/coreframe/app/admin/copyfrom.php`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The `keywords` variable obtained from `$GLOBALS['keywords']` is used to construct the `where` clause of the SQL query without proper sanitization.  This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code through this parameter.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not validate or sanitize the `keywords` input before including it in the SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Database Compromise:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially allowing them to:
    - Extract sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials, configurations, and application data.
    - Modify or delete data.
    - Potentially gain control over the database server.
- The provided PoC demonstrates an attacker can extract data using `updatexml`.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Parameter:** The vulnerability is exposed through the `keywords` parameter in an HTTP GET request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely through the web interface without needing any prior authentication as it occurs in the copyfrom listing page.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable `keywords` parameter and the URL structure.
