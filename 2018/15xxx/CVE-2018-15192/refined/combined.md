## Description

when an attacker is able to set the url of webhooks , he may set it to an internal address.

here is the result i have tested in try.gogs.io

[![tester](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13290978/43711424-39adf64e-99a5-11e8-8ae8-9fa71a94e7d2.jpg)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13290978/43711424-39adf64e-99a5-11e8-8ae8-9fa71a94e7d2.jpg)

you could see that i get the http response of caddy running in 127.0.0.1:80 of try.gogs.io , which is only opened to local user

also , i could know which port is opened like mysql in port 3306 , even it just opened to a local user

## Patch

check the url that users may input , webhooks shouldn't allow such internal address access

reference on how GitLab deals with SSRF in webhooks
