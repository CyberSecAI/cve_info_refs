Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2018-15910:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability stems from a type confusion issue within the `LockDistillerParams` parameter in Ghostscript. Specifically, the code fails to properly validate the type of the `LockDistillerParams` parameter before processing it. This lack of type checking allows an attacker to supply a value of an unexpected type.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Type Confusion:** The primary weakness is the lack of type validation for the `LockDistillerParams` parameter. This enables a type confusion vulnerability.
* **-dSAFER Bypass:** The type confusion allows an attacker to bypass the `-dSAFER` protection mechanism which is intended to limit the operations that can be performed by the Ghostscript interpreter. This is a critical security sandbox mechanism.
* **Memory Corruption:** The type confusion may lead to memory corruption, which can be leveraged for further exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** A specially crafted PostScript file can cause Ghostscript to crash, leading to a denial of service.
* **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potentially):** By exploiting the memory corruption vulnerability, a remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the Ghostscript process. This implies the attacker gains the privileges associated with the process executing Ghostscript.
* **File Creation/Access:** Exploitation might also involve the ability to create or access arbitrary files.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Malicious PostScript File:** A specially crafted PostScript file is the primary attack vector.
* **User/Automated System Interaction:** An attacker could trick a user or automated system into processing the malicious file. This may be achieved through various means, such as email attachments, website downloads, or other data feeds processed by software that uses Ghostscript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need prior access or credentials on the target system.
* **Ability to deliver malicious file:** The attacker needs a way to get a malicious PostScript file processed by a vulnerable Ghostscript instance, be it directly or through another application.

**Technical Details and Descriptions:**
* **`LockDistillerParams`:** This parameter in Ghostscript is supposed to accept a boolean value, controlling certain behavior within the distiller. Due to the type checking failure, arbitrary data of other types may be injected.
* **`-dSAFER`:** The `-dSAFER` command-line option is designed to provide a sandbox environment to restrict potentially dangerous operations that Ghostscript can perform. Bypassing this mechanism is a serious security concern.
* **Exploit Code Available:** Publicly available exploit code exists, which amplifies the risk of wide scale exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was reported by Tavis Ormandy from Google Project Zero.
*   Multiple vendors (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, Red Hat, Gentoo, etc) were affected.
*   Patches were released by Artifex Software (Ghostscript maintainers) and included in Ghostscript version 9.24.
*   Some workarounds included disabling specific coders (PS, EPS, PDF, XPS) in applications like ImageMagick or removing Ghostscript entirely.

This vulnerability highlights the importance of proper input validation and type checking, especially when dealing with interpreters like Ghostscript, where untrusted code execution is a risk.
