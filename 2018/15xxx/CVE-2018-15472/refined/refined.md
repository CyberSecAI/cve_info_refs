Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-15472:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the diff formatter, which utilizes `rouge`, lacking a timeout mechanism when processing diffs within Sidekiq jobs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of timeout: The absence of a timeout for the diff formatter in Sidekiq jobs is the core weakness. This allows an attacker to submit specially crafted input that can cause the formatter to run indefinitely without finishing.
- Denial of Service: The vulnerability allows an attacker to cause a denial-of-service by overwhelming the server with diff formatting jobs that never complete.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service: Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition. The affected GitLab instance will become unresponsive and unavailable to users because server resources are consumed by the never-ending formatting jobs.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious diff input: Attackers can exploit this by submitting malicious or very complex diffs, possibly through merge requests or code commits, that trigger the vulnerable diff formatting process within a Sidekiq job.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- User Account: An attacker needs a user account on the GitLab instance and the ability to create or modify content such as merge requests or code commits.
- No Special Privileges: The attacker does not require admin-level privileges; a regular user account with the capacity to create content is enough to initiate the attack.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects GitLab CE/EE versions 7.6 and later.
