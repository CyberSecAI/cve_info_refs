- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Cisco Webex Network Recording Player and Cisco Webex Player improperly validate Advanced Recording Format (ARF) and Webex Recording Format (WRF) files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation of ARF and WRF files leading to a buffer overflow (CWE-787).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could send a user a malicious ARF or WRF file via a link or an email attachment and persuade the user to open the file using the vulnerable software.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious ARF/WRF file to the victim and convince them to open it with the vulnerable software.
