Based on the provided documents, here's the relevant information regarding CVE-2018-15441:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied input in SQL queries within the web framework code of Cisco Prime License Manager (PLM).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection (CWE-89)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries.
- This could allow the attacker to:
  - Modify and delete arbitrary data in the PLM database.
  - Gain shell access with the privileges of the `postgres` user.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can send crafted HTTP POST requests containing malicious SQL statements to the affected application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the affected Cisco Prime License Manager instance.
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication or privileges on the system.

**Affected Products:**
- Cisco Prime License Manager Releases 11.0.1 and later.
- Both standalone and coresident deployments (where PLM is installed as part of Cisco Unified Communications Manager and Cisco Unity Connection) are affected.

**Unaffected Products:**
- Cisco Unified Communications Manager and Cisco Unity Connection Releases 12.0 and later are not affected because they no longer include Cisco Prime License Manager.

**Additional Notes:**
- A patch `ciscocm.CSCvk30822_v2.0.k3.cop.sgn` has been released to address this vulnerability. An initial patch `ciscocm.CSCvk30822_v1.0.k3.cop.sgn` had functional issues, and should no longer be used.
- There are no workarounds that directly address the vulnerability, however, disabling the PLM feature in coresident deployments can close the attack vector for environments that do not use PLM.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 9.4 (Critical).
