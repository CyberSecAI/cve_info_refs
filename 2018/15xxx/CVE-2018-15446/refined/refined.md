Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-15446:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper protection of data returned in user meeting requests when the "Guest access via ID and passcode" option is set to "Legacy" mode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The system is improperly handling meeting request data, leading to the exposure of sensitive information. Specifically, meeting room unique identifiers are being revealed.
- **Insecure Configuration:** Using the "Legacy" mode for guest access makes the system vulnerable to this information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can discover the unique identifiers of meeting rooms.
- **Potential for Further Exploits:** Knowledge of meeting room IDs could enable further attacks. The advisory does not specify these further exploits in detail, but implies that access to the unique identifiers provides a foothold.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
- **Network:** The attack is carried out over the network.
- **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to the system to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected Cisco Meeting Server.
- **Ability to Send Meeting Requests:** The attacker needs the capability to send meeting requests to the target system.
- **No Credentials:** The attacker does not need any valid credentials or to be authenticated on the system.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is specific to the "Legacy" mode for "Guest access via ID and passcode". Switching to "Secure" mode prevents the exploit.
- There are no workarounds other than using the Secure mode.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is rated as medium severity with a CVSS score of 5.3.
- The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability.
