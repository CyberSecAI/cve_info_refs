## Description

[![@SwampDragons](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1008838?u=0cd143f84becfffc9515904fd6b6b6e4dd264d11&v=4&size=48)](/SwampDragons)[SwampDragons](https://github.com/SwampDragons)opened [on Aug 13, 2018](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/issues/6584#issue-350219254)

HashiCorp's security team pointed out an interesting potential exploit where if you request an amazon AMI via a source\_ami\_filter, but don't have "owner" selected, you can accidentally use a malicious base image instead of one from your own organization or a trusted vendor.

The impact of making the "owner" field required would be low for the users (I strongly suspect that a majority of people using the filter already define the owner field) but could save users from making a potentially dangerous mistake. I think we should have Packer fail during validation with an error that says this field must be designated; if we decide that there is a valid use case where people may not want to have to set this field, we could potentially allow an opt out like setting "owner" to "any" but honestly I can't think of a situation where this really makes a great deal of sense.

I'm going to slate this for v1.3.0 but I'd like to hear community thoughts.
