Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-15752:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The MensaMax Android application transmits authentication information (username and password) over plain HTTP. This means the data is sent in clear text without any encryption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unencrypted Communication:** The application uses plain HTTP for communication with the web server, exposing sensitive data during transmission.
*   **Clear Text Transmission:** Authentication information is transmitted in plain text within HTTP GET requests.
*   **Lack of Transport Layer Security:** The transport layer is not encrypted, leaving the data vulnerable to eavesdropping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Eavesdropping:** An attacker can intercept the unencrypted communication between the application and the server.
*   **Credential Exposure:**  The attacker can obtain the user's login username and password transmitted in plain text.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Once the attacker obtains the credentials, they can potentially gain unauthorized access to the user's account.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Sniffing:** An attacker can position themselves on the network and intercept the unencrypted HTTP traffic.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker could intercept the connection between the app and the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the user or in a position to intercept network traffic between the user's device and the server.
*   **Passive Observation:**  The attacker can passively monitor network traffic to capture credentials.

**Additional Notes**
The provided document also discusses another vulnerability, CVE-2018-15753, which is related to the use of a hardcoded encryption key, but that is not the subject of the current analysis.

The advisory provides a CVSS score of 8.2 for this vulnerability which is considered high.
