**Vulnerable App:**

```
CVE-2018-15685 - Electron WebPreferences Remote Code Execution
This is a minimal Electron application with a POC for CVE-2018-15685.

A remote code execution vulnerability has been discovered affecting apps with the ability to open nested child windows on Electron versions (3.0.0-beta.6, 2.0.7, 1.8.7, and 1.7.15). This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2018-15685.

For more information see my full write up on the Contrast Security blog (https://www.contrastsecurity.com/security-influencers/cve-2018-15685) or the write up on the offical blog from Electron (https://electronjs.org/blog/web-preferences-fix)

The project contains the fillowing files:

main.js - This is the app's main process. Note this has nodeIntegration disabled so it should not be possibe use "process"
index.html - This is an example rendered page. This could be remotely controlled URL, or a page from an application with an XSS. In this example even though it is a local file but should not have access to node bindings.
You can learn more about each of these components within the Quick Start Guide.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# CVE-2018-15685 - Electron WebPreferences Remote Code Execution

This is a minimal Electron application with a POC for [CVE-2018-15685](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15685).

> A remote code execution vulnerability has been discovered affecting apps with the ability to open nested child windows on Electron versions (3.0.0-beta.6, 2.0.7, 1.8.7, and 1.7.15). This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2018-15685.

For more information see [my full write up on the Contrast Security blog](https://www.contrastsecurity.com/security-influencers/cve-2018-15685) or the [write up on the offical blog from Electron](https://electronjs.org/blog/web-preferences-fix)

The project contains the fillowing files:

* `main.js` - This is the app's **main process**. Note this has `nodeIntegration` disabled so it should not be possibe use "process"
* `index.html` - This is an example rendered page. This could be remotely controlled URL, or a page from an application with an XSS. In this example even though it is a local file but should not have access to node bindings.

You can learn more about each of these components within the [Quick Start Guide](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start).

### Duane LaFlotte

CTO, Pulsar Security

  I feel like every person's first experience in cybersecurity should be OffSec. Before you go out to figure out how to create a zero-day and you get confused, if you start with OffSec, that won't happen due to how methodologically all the training is put together.      ![Emile Kok](/_astro/emile.C3f2EqfQ.png)

Contrast Labs has discovered a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting apps with the ability to open nested child windows on Electron versions (3.0.0-beta.6, 2.0.7, 1.8.7, and 1.7.15). This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2018-15685](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15685).

POC Available at: <https://github.com/matt-/CVE-2018-15685>

# What's Electron?

[Electron](https://electronjs.org/) is a framework that powers many of the applications you use every day. Slack, Atom, Visual Studio Code, WordPress Desktop, Github Desktop, Skype, and Google Chat are just a few applications built on the Electron framework. It allows a developer to quickly port a traditional web application to a native cross platform desktop application.

# Vulnerability Details

A recent [post](https://blog.bentkowski.info/2018/07/vulnerability-in-hangouts-chat-aka-how.html) was made by [@SecurityMB](https://twitter.com/SecurityMB) about a security issue in Google Chat where he could create a link that, when clicked, would redirect away from a Google site to content controlled by the attacker, but it would stay inside the Electron app. Upon Google’s review, they found that the reported issue could lead to remote code execution and paid a sizeable bounty.

Although Google quickly fixed the issue related to the redirect, I could not help but wonder what exactly the path to code execution could be. Google Chat is built on the Electron framework. Electron has a detailed security section [(available here)](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/security.md), and Google followed most of these practices. More specifically, they set “nodeIntegration” to false. Normally the web content of an Electron window has access to the Node Javascript engine underneath it. Node has many core libraries that give you access to the file system and let you execute code. This can be handy when building an app, but something you don’t want user-controlled code to have access to. With “nodeIntegration” set to false, even with the ability to load remote content we “should” be safe.

However, after a bit of testing I came across a relatively simple payload that gave me access to the Node bindings:

open('about:blank').open('data:text/html,<script>document.write(process.cwd())</script>')

At first, I thought that this must have just been an oversight by the Google Chat team, but after digging some more, I discovered that was not the case. Every window that is created should have these properties set:

After a bit more digging and a couple of conversations with Luca Carettoni <https://twitter.com/lucacarettoni>  (who has done some really great research / work with Electron in the past), it became apparent that this was a bug in the core Electron framework. We came across what seemed to be related to a commit in an unmerged PR: <https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/13222/commits/444b6f987bd793989999f64f40062f68217cf0ba>

Properties of the window were not being inherited properly through nested windows and iframes. This meant vulnerable windows are able to be spawned by any application where:

* user code runs inside an iframe, or
* can create an iframe, or
* if you open any of your windows with the “nativeWindowOpen: true” or “sandbox: true” options

(It’s a bit ironic that the two conditions leading to the issue are security controls)

See a video [here](https://contrastsecurity.wistia.com/medias/u3nt710b8r).

We then followed appropriate channels to notify the various teams.

The Electron team responded quickly to the issue, and had a patch ready to go in just a couple of days. They were truly great to work with!

At the end of the day, the “root cause” of the issue is insecure default settings. In this case, with the default settings, a window has access to Node bindings and is not isolated. So, with this bug, when a window did not inherit properties as expected, it fell back to the insecure defaults. It would be great if the fallback was safe defaults. While changing an API can be a difficult process I hope this is something the Electron Team will work towards.

# Recommendations for Electron

1. Follow the security guidelines at <https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/security.md>These are not the default so you need to make sure these are in place.
2. Most importantly, set contextIsolation to true and nodeIntegration to false.
3. Don’t allow user controlled HTML / Javascript (or an XSS) in an electron window if you can avoid it.
4. Handle how new windows are created (or block them if they are not needed)
   mainWindow.webContents.on('new-window', e => e.preventDefault())

# Protecting your Enterprise from similar CVEs

# As you leverage third party frameworks, be sure to validate the default security settings. Default values are often not those optimized for security.

We'd also like to thank the Electron team for being extremely responsive and for quickly working to provide a patch.

# WebPreferences Vulnerability Fix

August 22, 2018 Â· 2 min read[![ckerr](https://github.com/ckerr.png?size=96)](https://github.com/ckerr)[ckerr](https://github.com/ckerr)

A remote code execution vulnerability has been discovered affecting apps with the ability to open nested child windows on Electron versions (3.0.0-beta.6, 2.0.7, 1.8.7, and 1.7.15). This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2018-15685](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15685).

---

## Affected Platforms[â](#affected-platforms "Direct link to Affected Platforms")

You are impacted if:

1. You embed *any* remote user content, even in a sandbox
2. You accept user input with any XSS vulnerabilities

*Details*

You are impacted if any user code runs inside an `iframe` / can create an `iframe`. Given the possibility of an XSS vulnerability it can be assumed that most apps are vulnerable to this case.

You are also impacted if you open any of your windows with the `nativeWindowOpen: true` or `sandbox: true` option. Although this vulnerability also requires an XSS vulnerability to exist in your app, you should still apply one of the mitigations below if you use either of these options.

## Mitigation[â](#mitigation "Direct link to Mitigation")

We've published new versions of Electron which include fixes for this vulnerability: [`3.0.0-beta.7`](https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/tag/v3.0.0-beta.7), [`2.0.8`](https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/tag/v2.0.8), [`1.8.8`](https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/tag/v1.8.8), and [`1.7.16`](https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/tag/v1.7.16). We urge all Electron developers to update their apps to the latest stable version immediately.

If for some reason you are unable to upgrade your Electron version, you can protect your app by blanket-calling `event.preventDefault()` on the `new-window` event for all `webContents`'. If you don't use `window.open` or any child windows at all then this is also a valid mitigation for your app.

```
mainWindow.webContents.on('new-window', (e) => e.preventDefault());

```

If you rely on the ability of your child windows to make grandchild windows, then a third mitigation strategy is to use the following code on your top level window:

```
const enforceInheritance = (topWebContents) => {
  const handle = (webContents) => {
    webContents.on(
      'new-window',
      (event, url, frameName, disposition, options) => {
        if (!options.webPreferences) {
          options.webPreferences = {};
        }
        Object.assign(
          options.webPreferences,
          topWebContents.getLastWebPreferences(),
        );
        if (options.webContents) {
          handle(options.webContents);
        }
      },
    );
  };
  handle(topWebContents);
};

enforceInheritance(mainWindow.webContents);

```

This code will manually enforce that the top level windows `webPreferences` is manually applied to all child windows infinitely deep.
