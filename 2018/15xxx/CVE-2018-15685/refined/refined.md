  "CVE-2018-15685": {
    "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability has been discovered affecting apps with the ability to open nested child windows on Electron versions (3.0.0-beta.6, 2.0.7, 1.8.7, and 1.7.15).",
    "root_cause": "Insecure default settings and improper inheritance of window properties through nested windows and iframes.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Remote Code Execution (RCE)",
      "Improper inheritance of webPreferences in nested windows and iframes",
      "Insecure default settings"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Opening nested child windows",
        "User code running inside an iframe",
        "Creating an iframe",
         "Opening windows with the 'nativeWindowOpen: true' or 'sandbox: true' options"
    ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to run code inside an iframe, create an iframe, or leverage an XSS vulnerability.",
       "additional_info": "The vulnerability stems from the fact that properties of the window were not being inherited properly through nested windows and iframes, which caused the application to fall back to insecure defaults, where Node.js integration was not disabled. This allowed the execution of arbitrary code through the 'process' object. The fix involves ensuring that webPreferences are correctly inherited and preventing new windows from being opened if they are not needed. The vulnerability is triggered when a new window is opened from a vulnerable window using 'window.open()'"
