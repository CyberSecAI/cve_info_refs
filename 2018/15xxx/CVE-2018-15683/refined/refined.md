The provided content contains detailed information about multiple vulnerabilities in XBTIT Torrent Tracker. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information for CVE-2018-15683:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `returnto` parameter in the login page (`/index.php?page=login`) is vulnerable to an open redirect because it lacks proper validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Open Redirect:** The application does not validate or sanitize the `returnto` parameter, allowing an attacker to redirect users to an arbitrary external website.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Phishing:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL that includes the vulnerable `returnto` parameter, leading a user to a fraudulent website that may resemble the original site. This can be used to steal user credentials or other sensitive information.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Attackers could redirect to a site hosting malware, infecting users' systems.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** An attacker crafts a URL containing the vulnerable parameter with the target malicious URL as the value.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker could then send this malicious URL to users (through email, chat, etc.) that will be redirected after successful login.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker only needs to trick a user into clicking the malicious link, which requires no prior authentication or specific access to the application.
*   The user must already be logged in to the application for the redirect to occur instantly upon accessing the malicious link.
