Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-15416:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists because the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player and Cisco Webex Player improperly validate Advanced Recording Format (ARF) and Webex Recording Format (WRF) files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper validation of ARF and WRF files leads to a memory corruption vulnerability. The specific type of memory corruption is not described in detail but is likely a buffer overflow (CWE-787 is referenced) which allows arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a user a malicious ARF or WRF file via a link or email attachment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to persuade the user to open the malicious ARF or WRF file using the vulnerable software. This requires user interaction (UI:Required).
- The attacker does not need any special privileges on the target system (PR:None) prior to exploitation.
- The attack vector is local (AV:L) which means the attacker needs to get the malicious file onto the local machine first.
