Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-15440:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data written to log files and displayed on certain web pages of the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) web-based management interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. The lack of proper sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious script code into log files, which are later displayed on the web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary script code within the context of the ISE web-based management interface.
*   Potential access to sensitive browser-based information.
*   Possible compromise of the web interface, enabling further malicious actions by the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to convince a user of the ISE web interface to either:
    *   Click a specific, crafted link, or
    *   View an affected log file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Remote access to the affected Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE).
*   Ability to craft specific links or log entries with malicious script code.
*   Ability to convince a user of the ISE web interface to interact with the crafted link or view a specific malicious log.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is categorized as medium severity.
*   No workarounds are available.
*   Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
*   Public exploit code exists for this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is identified by Cisco bug ID CSCvm79609
*   CVSS v3 score: 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)
