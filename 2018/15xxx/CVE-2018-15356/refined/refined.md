Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a command injection flaw.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Command injection vulnerability exists in the Eltex ESR-200 router firmware version 1.2.0. This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the affected device.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 7.7, indicating a high severity. The specific impacts are rated as low confidentiality (C:L), low integrity (I:L), and low availability (A:L).
    *   This means an attacker could gain limited access to sensitive information, make limited changes to the system's configuration, and cause a limited disruption of the device's functionality.
*   The exploit requires authenticated access, making the attack less severe than an unauthenticated remote exploit.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), indicating that the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely through the network.
*   The attack complexity is low (AC:L), meaning the vulnerability is easy to exploit.
*   No user interaction (UI:N) is required.
*   The vulnerability has a scope change (S:C), suggesting that the vulnerability might affect other components or systems outside of the router itself.
*  The attacker must have low privileges (PR:L)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be authenticated to the device.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects Eltex ESR-200 routers running firmware version 1.2.0.
*   The vendor has released a patch in firmware version 1.3.0.
*   Kaspersky ICS CERT is the entity that reported the vulnerability.
