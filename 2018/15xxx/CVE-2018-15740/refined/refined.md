Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-15740:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. It occurs because the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when displaying it in the "Workflow Delegation" "Requesters" screen. Specifically, the "searchText" parameter in the request is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored XSS:** Malicious JavaScript code is stored within the application database or persistent storage. When a user views the affected page, the stored script is executed within their browser.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization/Output Encoding:** The application fails to sanitize user-provided input in the `searchText` parameter before rendering it in the web page. This allows the attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the context of a victim's browser. This can be used for a variety of attacks:
  - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing session cookies to gain unauthorized access to the victim's account.
  - **Data Theft:** Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive information within the application.
  - **Defacement:** Modifying the content of the web page to display misleading or malicious content.
  - **Malware Delivery:** Redirecting users to malicious sites for further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP POST request to the `/ADMPTechnicians.do` endpoint, specifically targeting the `listTechnicianRows` method.
- **Payload in "searchText" Parameter:** The malicious JavaScript payload is embedded within the `searchText` parameter of the POST request, which is then stored by the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to send HTTP requests:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Authenticated user:** It is implied by the form data that the attacker may require an authenticated session to reach the vulnerable functionality.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the specific URL (`/ADMPTechnicians.do`) and method (`listTechnicianRows`) that are vulnerable.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit specifically uses the following payload within the `searchText` parameter: `"><img src=x onerror=alert('TESTER')>`. This payload, when rendered within the page, will trigger an alert box displaying the text "TESTER", verifying the XSS vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is present in ManageEngine ADManager Plus version 6.5.7.
- The exploit was published on 2018-08-26, with the vulnerability discovery dated 2018-08-21.
- The exploit is categorized as a web application vulnerability and targets Windows x86-64 systems.
