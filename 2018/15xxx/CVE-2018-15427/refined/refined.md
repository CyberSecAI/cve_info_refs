Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-15427:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root account of the affected Cisco Video Surveillance Manager (VSM) software was not disabled before installation on specific Cisco Connected Safety and Security Unified Computing System (UCS) platforms.
- Default, static, and undocumented user credentials exist for this root account.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Hardcoded Credentials (CWE-798):** The vulnerability lies in the use of default, static user credentials for the root account that are not publicly documented.
- **Insecure Default Configuration:** The root account should have been disabled or have its credentials changed before deployment.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can log in to the affected system using the default root credentials.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Successful login grants the attacker root privileges.
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary commands with root privileges, potentially leading to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** No prior authentication is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the vulnerable system.
- **Knowledge of Default Credentials:** The attacker needs knowledge of the undocumented, static credentials for the root account.

**Summary**
The vulnerability is caused by the presence of default static credentials for the root account on Cisco Video Surveillance Manager software preinstalled on certain Cisco UCS platforms. A remote attacker can exploit this by using these credentials to gain root access and execute arbitrary commands.
