Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-15131:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of authentication responses when accessing the `/service/user/$user` URL without providing credentials. The presence or absence of the `WWW-Authenticate` header in the response reveals whether a user account exists on the system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Account Enumeration (CWE-203):** The system discloses the existence of valid user accounts based on the server's response headers, allowing an attacker to identify valid usernames without needing to guess or brute-force them directly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can discover valid usernames on the Zimbra system, which can then be used in further attacks such as password guessing or other account-based exploits.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** Sending HTTP GET requests to a specific URL (`/service/user/$user`) on the Zimbra server.
*   **Analyzing HTTP Headers:** Checking the presence or absence of the `WWW-Authenticate` header in the server's response to determine if the specified user exists.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target Zimbra server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users, as the detection mechanism relies on the serverâ€™s response to requests with or without valid credentials.
*   **Basic tools**: A standard browser or command-line tools like `curl` is sufficient to send the requests and analyze the response headers.

**Technical Details:**

1.  **Unauthenticated Request:** When accessing `https://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/service/user/$user` without authentication, the server responds with a `WWW-Authenticate: BASIC realm="Zimbra"` header.
2.  **Invalid Credentials:** When accessing with invalid username/password, the server *does not* include the `WWW-Authenticate` header.
3.  **Valid Username (HTTP Auth):** When accessing the URL with a valid username (even with an incorrect password) in the HTTP Authorization header, the server responds with the `WWW-Authenticate` header.

This behavior allows an attacker to probe different usernames and map out the existing user base by simply observing the HTTP response headers.

**Fix Information:**
The vulnerability was fixed in the following versions:
* 8.7.11 Patch 6
* 8.8.8 Patch 9
* 8.8.9 Patch 3
