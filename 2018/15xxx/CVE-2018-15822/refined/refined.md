Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2018-15822:

**Root Cause:**
- The `flv_write_packet` function in `libavformat/flvenc.c` did not properly check for empty audio packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Lack of input validation: The function proceeded to process audio packets without verifying if the packet size was non-zero.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The vulnerability leads to an assertion failure, potentially causing the application using the library to crash.
- This could be triggered by a crafted media file.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted media file: An attacker could create a specially crafted FLV file containing empty audio packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to provide a crafted file to a user or application using the vulnerable FFmpeg library. The user or application needs to attempt to process the crafted file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is related to FLV (Flash Video) encoding.
- The fix involves adding a check for empty audio packets and returning an error code (AVERROR(EINVAL)) if an empty packet is encountered.
- The vulnerability was initially reported by Chen Hongxu.
- This vulnerability was present in older versions of FFmpeg, specifically affecting Ubuntu 16.04 LTS before the patch was applied, and Debian 8 "Jessie".
-  The issue is triggered by encountering an empty audio packet during the encoding process for the FLV container format.
