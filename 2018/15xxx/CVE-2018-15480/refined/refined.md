- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The cloud API had a hidden parameter that allowed an authenticated user to reconfigure the server URL for a device registered to their account. This would cause a server URL reconfiguration command to be pushed to the device.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Hidden parameter in the cloud API that allows server URL reconfiguration.
    - Insecure device registration (CVE-2018-15478)
    - Lack of server certificate verification (CVE-2018-15476)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could reconfigure a maliciously registered device to their own rogue replica of the myStrom API and issue commands to the device, including firmware update commands, gaining full control over the device.
- **Attack vectors:** 
    - Network-based, leveraging the hidden parameter in the cloud API.
    - Exploits of other vulnerabilities: Insecure device registration and lack of server certificate verification are required to be chained for successful exploitation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** 
    - The attacker needs to have registered the device to their account by exploiting CVE-2018-15478.
    - The attacker needs to be able to modify network traffic via a MitM attack or by controlling the device's network configuration.
    - The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the myStrom cloud API.
