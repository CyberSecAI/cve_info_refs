Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) traffic by the SIP inspection engine in Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The core weakness is the insufficient validation or processing of SIP requests, allowing specially crafted requests to trigger a denial-of-service condition. Specifically, SIP requests with an invalid "Sent-by Address" of 0.0.0.0 have been observed to cause problems.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- This can manifest as:
    - Device reload (crash).
    - High CPU utilization, rendering the device unresponsive.
    - Incomplete SIP connections.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
- Attackers send crafted SIP requests to the affected device at a high rate.
- Attackers can use spoofed IP packets to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the affected device.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- SIP inspection is enabled by default in both Cisco ASA and FTD software.
- The vulnerability is present in Cisco ASA Software Release 9.4 and later and Cisco FTD Software Release 6.0 and later on both physical and virtual appliances when SIP inspection is enabled.
- Observed exploits show the offending traffic with a “Sent-by Address” of 0.0.0.0
- Indicators of compromise include a high number of incomplete SIP connections and high CPU utilization.
- The vulnerability is being actively exploited.
- There are no workarounds, but several mitigation options, like disabling SIP inspection, blocking the offending host, filtering on sent-by address, and rate limiting SIP traffic are available.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
