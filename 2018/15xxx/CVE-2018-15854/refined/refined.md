As part of ignoring it, the float AST node and various keywords were removed, and instead NULL was returned by their parsing actions. However, the rest of the code does not handle NULLs, and so when they appear crashes usually ensue.\n\nThe vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference in the XKB parser when encountering geometry tokens.\n\nThe impact of exploitation is a crash, leading to a denial of service.\n\nThe attack vector is by supplying a crafted keymap file that contains geometry tokens.\n\nThe required attacker capabilities is the ability to supply a crafted keymap file to the xkbcommon library."
