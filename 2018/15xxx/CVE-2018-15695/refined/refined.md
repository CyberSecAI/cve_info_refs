Based on the provided content, here's the information related to CVE-2018-15695:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Path traversal vulnerability in `wallpaper.cgi`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path traversal: The application does not properly sanitize user-provided input for the `appdirpath` and `file` parameters in the `wallpaper.cgi` script, allowing a malicious actor to specify paths outside of the intended directory.
- Arbitrary file deletion: Due to the path traversal, an attacker can specify any file on the filesystem and delete it.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file deletion: An attacker can delete any file on the filesystem. This could lead to data loss, system instability, or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via HTTP requests.
- Authenticated: The attacker must have valid credentials to access the system's web interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be a non-administrative user with network access to the vulnerable ASUSTOR device. They must also have a valid session ID to perform the actions.

**Technical Details:**

The Tenable research advisory provides the following curl command to demonstrate the vulnerability:
```
$ curl -k "https://192.168.1.10:8001/portal/apis/wallpaper/wallpaper.cgi?sid=2LEyW3.EhAYUCWVF&act=removewallpaper&appdirpath=../../../tmp&file=test.file"
```

This command sends a request to the `wallpaper.cgi` script with the `act` parameter set to `removewallpaper`. The `appdirpath` parameter is set to `../../../tmp`, which allows the attacker to traverse up several directories from the intended directory. The `file` parameter specifies the file to be deleted, in this case `test.file`.

This demonstrates that an attacker can delete any file on the filesystem accessible to the webserver with the privileges of the web server process.
