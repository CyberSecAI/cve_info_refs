Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2018-15677:

**Root Cause:**
- Lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection when posting new news items.
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the title of news items.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **CSRF:** The application doesn't validate the origin of requests when adding new news items. This allows an attacker to trick a user into submitting a crafted form.
- **Stored XSS:** The title field for news items is not sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code that is then stored in the database and executed when the news item is viewed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can lure an authenticated user to a malicious web page that automatically submits a form to create a new news item with a malicious title.
- When other users view the compromised news item, the injected JavaScript code will be executed in their browsers, potentially allowing the attacker to:
    - Steal session cookies
    - Perform actions on behalf of the user.
    - Deface the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious website that contains a form submitting to the vulnerable news posting endpoint (`/index.php?page=news&act=confirm`)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious web page.
- The attacker needs to lure an authenticated user of the XBTIT tracker to the malicious page.
