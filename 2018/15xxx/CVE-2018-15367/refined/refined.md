- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of a user-supplied value before it is dereferenced as a pointer within the `ctl_set KERedirect` kext function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Untrusted pointer dereference.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel, leading to privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors:** Local attackers.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
