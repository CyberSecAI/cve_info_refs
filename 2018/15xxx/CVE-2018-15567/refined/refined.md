Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input in the `title` field of the CMSUno application. Specifically, the application allows a user to insert arbitrary HTML and Javascript into a `title` field, which is then rendered in the context of the web page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a persistent or stored XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, allowing them to:
  - Steal session cookies
  - Redirect users to malicious websites
  - Modify the content of the page
  - Perform actions on behalf of the victim user
- **Account Compromise:** Through session hijacking or other means, the attacker could potentially gain control over the user's account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **User Input:** The attack vector is through user input in the `title` field of the CMSUno application, as the provided description states that the vulnerability is located in `title[titre]`.
- **Persistent XSS:** The injected payload is stored and executed whenever a user views the affected page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the CMSUno application and must have the ability to modify the title field.
- **Access to CMSUno:** Attacker requires access to the CMSUno application itself to inject malicious payload into the `title` field.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided images confirm the successful execution of the injected JavaScript payload, demonstrating the XSS vulnerability.
- The specific payload used was `<script>alert(1)</script>`.
- The vulnerability was found in CMSUno version 1.5.2.
