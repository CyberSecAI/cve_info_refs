The provided content describes two vulnerabilities in the MensaMax Android application. This response focuses on the second vulnerability which is associated with CVE-2018-15753.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application uses a static, hardcoded DES key to encrypt login credentials.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-   **Hardcoded Encryption Key (CWE-321):** The DES key is embedded directly within the Android application's APK file. This makes it easily accessible to anyone who obtains the application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-   An attacker can extract the hardcoded DES key from the APK.
-   The attacker can then use this key to decrypt login credentials transmitted over unencrypted HTTP connections (as described in the first vulnerability)
-   The impact is primarily confidentiality, as user credentials can be exposed.

**Attack vectors:**
-   **Network eavesdropping:** Intercepting the HTTP traffic between the application and the server.
-   **APK Analysis:** Obtaining the application's APK file and reverse engineering it to find the hardcoded key.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   Ability to intercept network traffic or access the application's APK file.
-   Basic knowledge of reverse engineering Android applications and cryptography.
