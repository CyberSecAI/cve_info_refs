- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Devices did not authenticate themselves to the cloud in device-to-cloud communication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of device authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could impersonate any device by guessing or learning their MAC address, allowing injection of fake metrics into cloud statistics.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could send malicious requests to the cloud API, impersonating a device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to be able to guess or learn a device's MAC address.
