Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2018-15979:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A flaw in Microsoft's NTLM authentication implementation allowed attackers to redirect a user to a malicious resource outside the organization. This was triggered through Adobe Acrobat and Reader when processing a crafted PDF, leading to the exposure of NTLM authentication messages.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- NTLM SSO hash theft, which can be categorized as an information disclosure vulnerability.
- The vulnerability arises from how Adobe Acrobat and Reader interact with the NTLM authentication process.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could lead to an inadvertent leak of the user's hashed NTLM password. This can be used for further attacks like credential stuffing or pass the hash attacks on other resources.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted PDF document.
- An attacker can redirect a user to a malicious resource outside the user's organization to obtain NTLM authentication messages.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious PDF to the target user.
- The user must open the PDF using a vulnerable version of Adobe Acrobat or Reader.

**Additional Information:**
- Proof-of-concept code for CVE-2018-15979 is publicly available.
- Adobe categorizes this as an "Important" severity vulnerability.
- The vulnerability can be mitigated by updating Acrobat and Reader to the latest versions, which include a fix for this issue. Also, enabling the Protected View feature in Acrobat/Reader helps mitigate the risk, especially when opening PDFs within Internet Explorer.
- Microsoft has issued an optional security enhancement to disable NTLM SSO authentication as a method for public resources, mitigating the vulnerability. However, this mitigation is primarily for Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016.
- The EdgeSpot team was credited for discovering and reporting this vulnerability.
