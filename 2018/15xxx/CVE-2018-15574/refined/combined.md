# Whatâs New in RLM 16.1[ï](#what-s-new-in-rlm-version "Link to this heading")

Important

Version 16.0 brings an all-new web management interface to RLM, with many changes.
End-user documentation may need to be updated before distributing RLM to your users. For an
overview of the new interface, [see the overview video on our blog.](/new-rlm-release-v16-0)

* **There are new build requirements for Mac and Windows:**

  + Mac - Link with:

    - fobjc-arc
    - framework CoreWLAN
  + Windows - Add link:

    - bcrypt.lib
* **Upgraded to OpenSSL 3.0.15**

  + Removed the rlmssl namespace. If you need to link an older or newer build of OpenSSL to RLM, build the NOSSL from the RLM makefile.
  + Removed the rlmssl\_ERR\_remove\_state(0); call. This call must be removed from your code after upgrading.
* **The following have been added back to the web interface:**

  + Metered licenses
  + Alternate Server Hostid
  + License Transfer

## Problems fixed in this release[ï](#problems-fixed-in-this-release "Link to this heading")

* CVE-2018-15573
* CVE-2018-5716
* **Bug**: Debuglog now works correctly in web interface.
* **Bug**: UI functions not working when ISV name is 10 characters.
* **Bug**: RLM crashing when no certificate is present.
* **Bug**: License usage not displaying when license password is set.
* **Bug**: Web server error when license file is larger than 1024KB (Linux) / 2048KB (Windows).

## Known issues in this release[ï](#known-issues-in-this-release "Link to this heading")

* License signing with rlmsign fails when the filename contains a non-ASCII character.
* RLM Cloud web services API fails to retrieve log files if it contains wide/8-bit characters (can still retrieve log files via web portal).
* Activating a license using the web server fails when an IP address is used as the hostid.
* Product returned from rlm\_actinfo2() is incorrect if variable is not sized specifically.
* RLM web interface performance may be slow when running RLM on Windows. Sentinel HASP drivers can be installed to improve this.
* Unable to reset passwords without at least one login.

## Platform changes[ï](#platform-changes "Link to this heading")

* Added Windows ARM64

## Dependency changes[ï](#dependency-changes "Link to this heading")
