  "cve": "CVE-2018-15705",
  "description": "WADashboard API in Advantech WebAccess 8.3.1 and 8.3.2 allows remote authenticated attackers to write or overwrite any file on the filesystem due to a directory traversal vulnerability in the writeFile API. An attacker can use this vulnerability to remotely execute arbitrary code.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A directory traversal vulnerability exists due to the lack of input validation when processing the 'folderpath' parameter in an HTTP POST request to '/WADashboard/api/dashboard/v1/files/writeFile'.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Directory Traversal",
       "Insufficient Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can write or overwrite any file on the filesystem, leading to arbitrary code execution. Specifically, by writing a malicious ASP script to the web server directory, attackers can execute OS commands with Administrator privileges through the 'webdobj.webdraw' class.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP POST request to `/WADashboard/api/dashboard/v1/files/writeFile`"
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Remote, authenticated attacker with low-privilege access. The attacker must have valid credentials to login to the WADashboard API."

    "Advantech WebAccess 8.3.1",
