Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2018-15890:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `Ethash` class in `ethereumj` uses standard Java object serialization to store light and full datasets. This process is inherently vulnerable to exploitation due to unsafe deserialization practices.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unsafe Java Object Deserialization:** The application uses Java's built-in serialization mechanism without proper safeguards against malicious payloads. This allows an attacker to potentially inject arbitrary code during the deserialization process if the data is obtained from an untrusted source.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  The impact is not specifically stated to be high in this issue, the main issue is the use of unsafe Java serialization. Exploitation can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution on the system running the vulnerable application. The ysoserial project (linked) includes proof-of-concept tools demonstrating various code execution exploits using unsafe Java deserialization.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could craft malicious serialized Java objects and supply them to the application where `Ethash` data is deserialized. The specific attack vector would depend on how and where the application reads the serialized data. This could involve exploiting a network service, file system, or other data input points.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious serialized data to the vulnerable application. The precise required access will depend on the application design.
- The attacker needs to have the knowledge to create malicious Java serialized objects. This is easily achieved using tools like ysoserial.

**Additional Notes:**
- The linked `ysoserial` project demonstrates exploits against unsafe Java deserialization and provides a tool for creating malicious payloads targeting various libraries.
- The issue report suggests switching to custom serialization to mitigate this risk.
- The report notes that while the vulnerability is present, it may not be easily exploitable in this particular case.
