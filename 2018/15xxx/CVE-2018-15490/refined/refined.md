Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-15490:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation in the `XVPN.GetPreference` and `XVPN.SetPreference` JSON-RPC methods within the `xvpnd.exe` process of ExpressVPN. The "key" parameter, intended for specifying preference names, is treated as a file path without proper sanitization, allowing path traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The application does not properly validate the 'key' parameter allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary paths.
- **Insecure RPC Interface:** The `xvpnd.exe` process, running with SYSTEM privileges, exposes an RPC interface on TCP port 2015 which communicates via HTTP and JSON-RPC.
- **World Readable Access Token:** The access token needed to interact with the RPC interface is stored in a file (`C:\ProgramData\ExpressVPN\v4\access_token`) that is readable by all authenticated users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker can read any file on the filesystem with SYSTEM privileges using `XVPN.GetPreference`.
- **Arbitrary File Write:** An attacker can create or overwrite files anywhere on the filesystem with SYSTEM privileges using `XVPN.SetPreference`, which enables local privilege escalation.
- **Local Privilege Escalation:** By writing a malicious command script to a location and tricking ExpressVPN to execute the script, an attacker can elevate their privileges to SYSTEM level.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** Exploiting the JSON-RPC interface on TCP port 2015.
- **Local:** Requires local access to the system but does not require administrative privileges.
- **File System:** Manipulating the file system by reading files and writing malicious scripts to disk.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must be able to log into the Windows system as any authenticated user.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to reach the RPC service exposed by ExpressVPN's `xvpnd.exe` process via the network interface (localhost).
- **Read Access:** The attacker must be able to read the `access_token` file.
