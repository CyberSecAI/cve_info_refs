  "cve": "CVE-2018-15137",
  "description": "Cela Link CLR-M20 2.7.1.6 allows unauthorized users to upload arbitrary files via WebDAV using the PUT method. This can lead to remote code execution by uploading executable file types (e.g., asp, aspx, cfm, html, jhtml, jsp, shtml).",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the use of WebDAV without proper access controls, allowing unauthenticated users to upload arbitrary files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper access control",
       "Unrestricted file upload"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution is possible by uploading and then accessing malicious scripts or executable files.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based",
      "HTTP PUT method"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without requiring prior authentication.",
     "details": "The vulnerability allows arbitrary file upload by using the PUT method. The proof of concept demonstrates uploading a simple HTML file. However, more dangerous file types such as ASP, ASPX, CFM, HTML, JHTML, JSP, SHTML can be uploaded."
