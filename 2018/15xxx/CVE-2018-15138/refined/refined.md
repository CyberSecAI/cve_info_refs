```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application allows directory traversal through the `filename` parameter in the `/ipecs-cm/download` URI.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Directory Traversal",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read sensitive files on the vulnerable system, potentially gaining access to configuration files.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a GET request to the `/ipecs-cm/download` endpoint with a manipulated `filename` parameter containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`), an attacker can access files outside of the intended directory.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application, without requiring authentication."
