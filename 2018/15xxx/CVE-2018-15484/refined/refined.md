Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-15484:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the ability to modify the `autoexec.bat` file via the KONE Group Controller (KGC) web interface through an unauthenticated local file modification method. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary operating system commands. These commands are then executed at boot time, effectively granting the attacker the ability to run malicious code on the KGC system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary code remotely without needing to authenticate to the system. This is achieved by exploiting the file modification vulnerability.
*   **Unauthenticated Local File Modification:** An attacker can modify sensitive system files (`autoexec.bat`) without authentication, allowing for malicious changes.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The web interface does not properly sanitize input when modifying the `autoexec.bat`, leading to the possibility of injecting arbitrary commands.
*   **Insecure Default Configuration:** The KGC software has a default configuration that allows HTTP and FTP services, which are enabled and unauthenticated, exposing the system to potential remote attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the KGC system, potentially leading to complete system compromise and control over the elevator group controller.
*   **Denial of Service:** If the attack results in system crashes or reboots the attacker can cause a DoS by repeatedly rebooting the system.
*   **Manipulation of Elevator Control:** Depending on the building's setup, attackers could:
    *   Cause a denial of elevator service in buildings with destination control systems, parking elevators and preventing users from calling them
    *   Reduce transport capacity in buildings with conventional elevator control.
    *   Open access to locked floors or close access to unlocked floors in buildings with integrated access control.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The primary attack vector is through network access. An attacker needs to be on the same LAN as the KGC, typically a dedicated network in the elevator machine room.
*   **Web Interface:** Attackers exploit the web interface of the KGC to modify files.
*   **FTP:** The presence of an unsecured FTP service also provides an avenue to manipulate files on the system, although this is a separate vulnerability (CVE-2018-15485).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **LAN Access:** Attackers require access to the same Local Area Network (LAN) as the KGC device.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No credentials or authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network knowledge:** The attacker has to have a degree of network knowledge in order to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Sebastian Neuner (@sebastian9er) of Google Security Team.
*   The vulnerabilities were fixed in KGC software version 4.6.5.
*   The fixes involve disabling HTTP and FTP services by default.
*   Physical access to the KGC computer still poses a risk even after the software is updated.
