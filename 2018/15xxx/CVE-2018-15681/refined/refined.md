Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-15681:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the way XBTIT stores user passwords and sets the "pass" cookie. The system uses an unsalted MD5 hash of the user's password and concatenates a random number ($RND) to the beginning and end of this hash. It then MD5 hashes the entire resulting string and stores it in the 'pass' cookie. The random number is limited between 100000 and 999999.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Unsalted MD5 Password Hashing:** User passwords are initially stored as unsalted MD5 hashes, making them vulnerable to rainbow table attacks.
2.  **Password Hash in Cookie:** The 'pass' cookie stores a second MD5 hash, derived from the concatenation of the user’s unsalted MD5 password hash and a predictable random number.
3.  **Predictable Random Number:** The random number used for the second hash has a limited range, making it possible to create a wordlist of all possible combinations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker who can obtain the 'pass' cookie (e.g., via an XSS attack) can reverse the double hashing using the generated wordlist to find the original MD5 hash of the user’s password. After obtaining the original password hash, the plain text password can be obtained using a wordlist or rainbow table. This allows the attacker to completely compromise user accounts and gain unauthorized access to the XBTIT system.

**Attack Vectors:**
1. **XSS Attack:** An attacker needs to execute arbitrary JavaScript in a victim's browser (using any of the multiple XSS vulnerabilities).
2. **Cookie Theft:** The JavaScript would steal the `pass` cookie value.
3. **Offline Brute-force:** The attacker uses the stolen 'pass' cookie to generate all possible permutations of the password hash and random number.
4. **Password Recovery:** The original password MD5 hash is recovered from the generated list. Then, using the hash and a wordlist, the original password is recovered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1. **Ability to inject malicious JavaScript:** The attacker needs to be able to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in a victim's browser. This can be achieved by exploiting the XSS vulnerabilities.
2. **Offline computation capabilities:** An attacker needs to have the resources to generate a large wordlist of all the possible combinations and a tool capable of performing MD5 hash cracking using the generated wordlists
