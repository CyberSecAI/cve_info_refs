Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-15465:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper validation of user privileges within the web management interface of Cisco ASA software. Specifically, the authorization subsystem fails to correctly verify the privileges of authenticated users when accessing the web interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Authorization:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authorization checks for unprivileged users (levels 0 and 1) when they interact with the web management interface. This allows them to perform actions they shouldn't be able to.
- **Insufficient Privilege Separation:** The system does not adequately differentiate between unprivileged and privileged users when command authorization is disabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:**  An unprivileged attacker can gain the ability to perform privileged actions.
- **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can retrieve files from the device, including the running configuration, which could contain sensitive information.
- **Software Manipulation:** Attackers can upload and replace software images on the device, which could lead to further compromise.
- **Full System Control**: By uploading a malicious software image, a complete compromise of the device can be achieved.
- **Configuration Changes**: Attackers can modify the system configuration by adding privileged users via the API.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:**  The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over a network.
- **Web Management Interface:** The attack vector is through the web management interface via HTTPS.
- **HTTP Requests:** Exploitation is achieved by sending specially crafted HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected Cisco ASA device.
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with unprivileged access (levels 0 or 1). This implies a user with very limited access to the device.
- **Web Interface Access:** The attacker needs to access the web management interface.
- **Knowledge of the API**: The attacker needs to know the specific HTTP requests needed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is present when command authorization is disabled, which is the default setting on Cisco ASA devices.
- Enabling command authorization is a workaround, but requires careful configuration of privilege levels.
- Cisco has released software updates to address the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Ken Johnson of Tenable, Inc.
- The advisory from Tenable includes a proof of concept using curl to download the running configuration and add a privileged user, demonstrating the ease of exploitation.
