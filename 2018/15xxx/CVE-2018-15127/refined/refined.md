{
  "CVE-2018-15127": {
    "Description": "LibVNCServer contains a heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the server code of the file transfer extension, which can result in remote code execution.",
    "Root cause": "Heap out-of-bounds write in `rfbProcessFileTransferReadBuffer()` function within the server code's file transfer extension.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Heap out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "Impact": "Potential for remote code execution.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "Network connectivity to a vulnerable VNC server with file transfer enabled."
     ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Remote, unauthenticated attacker with network access to the affected system.",
    "Additional Details": "The vulnerability exists in the `rfbProcessFileTransferReadBuffer()` function within the server's file transfer extension. It stems from improper handling of the file transfer buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds write. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, requiring no user interaction or privileges, and successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution."
