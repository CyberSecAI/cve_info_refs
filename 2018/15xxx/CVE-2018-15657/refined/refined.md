```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly validate the URL provided in the `url` parameter of the `/api/DownloadUrlResponse.ashx` endpoint, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary URLs, including local file paths.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)",
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can force the web server to request remote files and display the output, or access local files on the server. This can lead to sensitive information disclosure, including SQL server credentials and configuration files.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "By sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/api/DownloadUrlResponse.ashx` endpoint with a malicious URL in the `url` parameter.",
      "The file:// URI scheme can be used to access local files."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can be unauthenticated and needs to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint, accessible over the network."
