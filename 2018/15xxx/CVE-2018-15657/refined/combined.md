## What is Mobile Device Management (MDM)?

Mobile Device Management (MDM) is a system that enables IT administrators to securely manage both company-owned and employee-owned mobile devices used within their organization. By employing an MDM system, administrators can exercise control over the software, hardware, security, and other aspects of mobile devices, ensuring enhanced security, compliance, and productivity.

SureMDM by 42Gears is an intuitive and powerful MDM solution and app available for Android, iOS/iPadOS, macOS, Windows 10 and 11, Linux, Wear OS, VR, ChromeOS, and IoT platforms. With SureMDM, IT teams can secure, monitor, and manage company-owned devices for dedicated use, as well as employee-owned devices used to access company data ([Bring Your Own Device or BYOD](https://www.42gears.com/blog/what-is-bring-your-own-device-byod/)). SureMDM encompasses all aspects of enterprise mobility management (EMM) and unified endpoint management (UEM), that includes Mobile Application Management, Mobile Device Management, and Mobile Content Management. All SureMDM plans include SureLock (industry-leading kiosk solution), SureFox (secure browser), and SureVideo (digital signage solution).

## Why is Mobile Device Management important?

In the modern business world, mobile devices have almost replaced conventional desktops. Companies are also increasingly shifting their infrastructure to the cloud, allowing employees to access applications, corporate data, and other resources from anywhere and on any device. This has provided businesses with greater mobility and flexibility.

However, this new wave of mobility has brought along greater cybersecurity risks and made device management even more difficult. These challenges make it imperative for businesses to adopt device management solutions.

## Mobile Device Management Solution for Device Lifecycle Management

Even for businesses asking “What is MDM?” it’s never too early or late to start using a mobile device management solution. Enterprise devices have different needs at different points in their life cycles. Using an MDM solution will help with every one of those points, helping businesses get the best return on investment.

![Android MDM for Device Lifecycle Management](data:image/svg+xml...)![Android MDM for Device Lifecycle Management](https://www.42gears.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/MDM-for-Device-Lifecycle-Management-1.webp)

![enroll](data:image/svg+xml... "enroll")![enroll](https://www.42gears.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/enroll.png "enroll")

**Enrollment**

SureMDM provides a comprehensive hub for enrolling any kind of device into your network. Where applicable, the MDM software works with [Android](https://www.42gears.com/products/mobile-device-management/android-device-management/) Zero-Touch Enrollment (ZTE), Apple Business Manager, and [Windows](https://www.42gears.com/products/mobile-device-management/windows-device-management/) Autopilot to rapidly build your device network. You can also manually enroll devices by installing an on-device MDM app and easily connecting the app to the central MDM console. Plus, you can enroll employee-owned [(BYOD)](https://www.42gears.com/solutions/byod/) devices through Android Work Profiles and Apple User Enrollment, and generate a secure virtual container to store sensitive data.

![provision (1)](data:image/svg+xml... "provision (1)")![provision (1)](https://www.42gears.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/provision-1.png "provision (1)")

**Provisioning**

MDM software makes it simple to provision devices with the apps and content they need. Use Apple Business Manager or Managed Google Play to push apps, or allow employees to access a secure, exclusive Enterprise App Store. For secure files, offer employees an exclusive File Store. You can also lock devices down to several apps, or a single app, to ensure employees use devices as intended once you deploy them. SureMDM’s [kiosk lockdown](https://www.42gears.com/products/kiosk-software/) component allows you to easily limit device functionality so devices can serve a dedicated purpose. Plus, mobile device management software also lets you lock down Internet browsing to pre-approved websites for safe browsing.

![deployment](data:image/svg+xml... "deployment")![deployment](https://www.42gears.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/deployment.png "deployment")

**Deployment**

Deploying devices to employees can be challenging if security certificates and other important credentials don’t reach every device properly. SureMDM gives you a straightforward way to push and check security certificates at any time, making sure that devices work well once deployed. Another potential problem is that devices may not properly sync to Wi-Fi, but if they are locked down, users can’t reconfigure Wi-Fi. SureMDM’s lockdown solution automatically opens network settings when necessary, even when device settings are normally blocked, making sure everyone can access the Internet at any time after deployment.

![management](data:image/svg+xml... "management")![management](https://www.42gears.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/management.png "management")

**Management**

Managing active devices requires admins to keep track of many things at once, and [42Gears](https://www.42gears.com/)’ device management solution makes that possible. With an MDM solution, you can automatically restrict device activity based on time of day and location, for example, and monitor data consumption to warn or block data-hungry devices. Plus, you can coordinate remote app updates across every device from the central console, even when devices are in the field. This keeps device software consistent between users without demanding excessive time from those users. Perhaps most importantly, remote troubleshooting allows admins to get devices working from anywhere, eliminating most travel costs and minimizing device downtime.

![retirement](data:image/svg+xml... "retirement")![retirement](https://www.42gears.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/retirement.png "retirement")

**Retirement**

When it comes time to phase out devices, you can use a mobile device management solution to keep track of devices and ensure they are all factory-reset. You can remotely wipe lost devices as well, to guarantee the data on those devices doesn’t fall into the wrong hands. With employee-owned devices, SureMDM makes it easy to remove the secure enterprise container from the device.

Lower maintenance costs by replacing many in-person repairs with remote troubleshooting via a device management solution.

Boost productivity by blocking access to games and entertainment via the on-device MDM app.

## Types of SureMDM Deployment

When setting up SureMDM, it’s important for you to choose between two deployment methods - cloud-hosted (SaaS) deployment and on-premise deployment. That’s because the method of deployment has a significant impact on how you  operate and maintain the  solution later on.

**Cloud-Hosted or SaaS Deployment**

If you choose to go for a SaaS deployment, 42Gears will host all of your company’s data on servers actually hosted by cloud-infrastructure service providers such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. It’s a great choice for companies looking for a straightforward way to quickly set up a mobile device management solution.

**Pros:**

* You can save substantial time and money by relying on pre-existing infrastructure.
* All maintenance activities are handled by 42Gears, so you don’t have to worry about behind-the-scenes logistics.
* You can scale up as needed as there will always be more space in the server whenever you feel the need to support more devices.

**Cons:**

* You have to trust us to keep your data safe. But rest assured, we have all sorts of safeguards to ensure data stays safe. You can check our security compliance certificates [here](https://www.42gears.com/security-and-compliance/).

****On-Premise Deployment****

If you choose to go ahead with an on-premise deployment, 42Gears will  lease its software (SureMDM) for use on your own servers. In this case, you will be fully responsible for maintaining and protecting the solution infrastructure.

**Pros:**

* You don’t have to store your company  data externally.

**Cons:**

* You will need to build and set up your on-site infrastructure, and then maintain and update it regularly. You will also need time to train your IT staff to do all related tasks.

Industries across the world are riding the wave of digitization. Like any other progressive enterprise, we need to keep up with the changing times by adopting new technologies into our business process. To do so, we offer our students special packages that would provide tablets to access study materials and files. We are happy with the way 42Gears products have ensured that the devices are only used for the educational intent they were meant for. Using 42Gears UEM tool, we are able to easily update and manage our app content, while keeping our tablets in secure lockdown.

### Mobile Device Management FAQs

#### **What is MDM?**

MDM stands for Mobile Device Management, which refers to the technology and policies used by businesses to
manage, monitor, and secure both employee-owned and company-owned mobile devices, such as smartphones and
tablets, used by their employees for business operations.

#### **What types of devices can be managed with MDM?**

MDM can be used to manage, monitor, control, and secure a wide range of mobile devices, including smartphones,
tablets, laptops, and other IoT devices used in corporate settings.

#### **What are MDM's features?**

MDM offers a range of features, including device enrollment and configuration, security policy enforcement,
application distribution and management, content distribution, fencing, remote support, device monitoring and
reporting, remote wiping and locking, and location tracking. Some MDM solutions may also offer advanced features
such as containerization, app wrapping, and secure browsing.

#### **Is MDM only for large enterprises?**

No, MDM is not only for large enterprises. Organizations of all sizes can deploy MDM solutions to manage and
secure mobile devices used in corporate settings.

#### **What does mobile device management do?**

Mobile device management allows businesses to manage and secure mobile devices used by their employees to access
corporate data and applications. MDM solutions enable organizations to enforce security policies, manage and
monitor devices, distribute applications, and remotely wipe data in the event of device loss or theft.

#### **What is Computer Device Management?**

Computer Device Management is the process and tools for managing the various devices that are connected to a
computer system, such as printers, scanners, external drives, and more. This process usually involves setting
up
the devices, configuring their settings, monitoring their performance, and providing maintenance and updates
when necessary.

#### **How much does Mobile Device Management cost?**

Mobile Device Management (MDM) software can vary in price depending on the features and capabilities it
includes. Generally speaking, prices range from $3 per device per month for basic device management features
to
$9 per device per month for more advanced and feature-rich MDM solutions. It is important to evaluate your
needs
before deciding which MDM solution to use, as this will help determine the most cost-effective solution for
your
organization.

#### **What types of devices are managed by a mobile device management solution?**

An MDM solution can manage a variety of devices, including smartphones, tablets, and other mobile computing
devices. It supports a range of operating systems and versions, including Android, iOS, Linux, MacOS and
Windows. Additionally, some solutions can also be used to manage desktop computers, laptops, and other common
workplace devices. Very few solution providers also offer custom solutions for less common platforms, such as
Blackberry and Windows Phone.

#### **Can a mobile device management solution spy on you?**

No, a solution that used to manage devices remotely cannot spy on you. Mobile device management tools are
technologies that allows businesses to remotely configure and manage their mobile devices, and protect the
data
on these devices, in order to ensure security and compliance with corporate policies. However, someone having
access to the MDM tool with elevated permissions can perform undesirable actions on the user's device,
including
surviellance.
The most common misuses of these solutions include using them to view personal
information such as emails, texts, or web browsing activities, accessing company data without the employee's
permission, and attempting to access information or devices that are beyond the scope of the solutions.
Other
misuses include using the solution's remote access capability to unlawfully monitor an employee's
activities,
collecting and storing personal information without consent, and using the solution to gain access to
confidential information.

#### **Can a mobile device management solution be used to listen to phone calls?**

It depends on the MDM (Mobile Device Management) provider and the type of MDM solution being used. Some MDM
solutions have features that allow businesses to manage and monitor their employees' mobile devices, but it is
typically not possible to use these features to listen to phone calls. Generally speaking, employers should
not
attempt to listen to employees' phone calls, as this could be illegal.

#### **What Can My Company See with Mobile Device Management (MDM)?**

MDM allows your company to monitor and manage certain aspects of your device for security purposes. Here's a transparent look at what your company can and cannot see:
##### What Your Company CAN See:

* Device information (model, OS version, serial number)
* Work email and corporate app usage
* Device security status (encryption, passcode settings)
* Installed apps list
* Network connection details
* Location data (if enabled by policy)
* Corporate data storage and usage
* Security compliance status

##### What Your Company CANNOT See:

* Personal photos and videos
* Personal text messages and phone calls
* Personal emails and social media
* Personal browsing history
* Passwords
* Banking apps and data
* Private files and documents
* Personal calendar events

##### Important Privacy Notes:

* BYOD (personal devices) have more privacy protections than company-owned devices
* Android work profiles keep personal and work data completely separate
* iOS maintains strict boundaries between work and personal content
* You have the right to know what data your company collects

Remember: Company-owned devices typically allow more extensive monitoring compared to personal devices used for work. Always check your organization's MDM policy or consult IT for specific details about monitoring on your device.

#### **Can MDM see photos?**

No, Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions cannot directly view or access personal photos on your smartphone, unless they are conifgured to do so. When you use your personal device for work (BYOD), MDM software like SureMDM only has access to work-related data and basic device information like model and OS version.

#### **Can an MDM do location tracking?**

Yes, MDM solutions have features that allow businesses to track the location of their employees' mobile
devices.
This can be an important security feature for businesses, as it allows them to ensure that their mobile
workforce is in compliance with company policies and regulations. Location tracking can also be used to
optimize
resource utilization and improve customer service.

#### **Can MDM see what apps I have downloaded?**

It depends on how the device was enrolled into the MDM. Some MDM solutions have features that allow businesses
to monitor the apps that their employees have downloaded to their mobile devices. This can be used to ensure
compliance with company policies, as well as to track the effectiveness of employee device usage. In addition,
businesses can also use MDM to restrict access to certain apps, and even remotely uninstall apps if necessary.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Multiple Vulnerabilities Found in Mobile Device Management Software

January 31, 2019

A few months ago during a penetration test, we stumbled upon a Windows based mobile device management [MDM] system named SureMDM. MDM systems aim to provide an efficient means of managing a large number of mobile devices, ensuring that they are all configured to the same standard and kept secure.

The customers section of the vendor’s website boasts quite the impressive list, including organisations such as AT&T, Facebook and Siemens, to name a few. With a wide user base, it was presumed the system would be quite extensive and have a larger attack surface to explore.

Initially, there was not a great deal presented to us. Pretty much the entire system required authentication and we had no credentials. However, there were two dangerous misconfigurations that allowed cross-origin requests; which were the first of several vulnerabilities, that when combined with other issues that were found, could lead to a severe compromise.

### Weak CORS Configuration: CVE-2018-15655

The first of the misconfiguration issues was in the CORS policy. The CORS policy would allow requests to be made from any origin. As a result of this, if an attacker was able to lure a user to a website that they either control or have compromised in some way, they could effectively carry out any action as the victim and exfiltrate sensitive data.

To confirm this, we hosted a small proof of concept on one of our servers, the markup for which can be found below:

```
<html>
<head>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <pre class="remote-content">
  </pre>

  <script type="text/javascript">
    var url = (location.search.split('url=')[1] || '').split('&')[0]
    $.get(url, null, function (data) {
      $('.remote-content').text(data)
    }, 'text')
  </script>
</body>
</html>

```

This page will attempt to load the address provided to the `url` query string parameter, and display the data on screen. If a URL is requested from a website with a secure CORS policy, it will result in an error, as can be seen in the below screenshot when requesting a resource from Google:

![](/assets/img/2019-01-31-multiple-vulnerabilities-found-in-mobile-device-management-software/secure-cors.png)

However, when changing the URL to one being served by the SureMDM system, the request is successful and the content available to be processed:

![](/assets/img/2019-01-31-multiple-vulnerabilities-found-in-mobile-device-management-software/insecure-cors.png)

### Weak Silverlight Access Policy: CVE-2018-15659

Much like the weak CORS policy, the weak Silverlight access policy meant that a request could be made from any origin via a Silverlight application. To test this, we used [This PoC from NCC Group](https://github.com/nccgroup/CrossSiteContentHijacking).

When a resource served by SureMDM was specified as the target page, the Silverlight application could successfully access the resource from a different origin:

![](/assets/img/2019-01-31-multiple-vulnerabilities-found-in-mobile-device-management-software/silverlight-poc.png)

### Incorrect Access Control: CVE-2018-15658

After discovering the cross-origin issues, we were left with only theoretical scenarios to present to the client as we weren’t sure of what could be achieved from the web UI; then we came across `/console/ConsolePage/Master.html`.

As one would expect from a page that requires authentication, when we tried to access this, we were redirected back to the login page - something was not quite right though. When reviewing our request history - there was no sign of any responses with a [3xx code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#3xx_Redirection).

This prompted us to take a look at the request being made to `Master.html` and revealed that the session validation and redirection was being carried out in the JavaScript as the page is loaded. The result of this? We were able to see the markup that would be presented to an authenticated user:

![](/assets/img/2019-01-31-multiple-vulnerabilities-found-in-mobile-device-management-software/console-markup.png)

Upon examining the markup, we were able to gather links to unprotected resources which when pooled together revealed over 100 different API endpoints. These endpoints included functions to carry out a number of highly sensitive actions, such as:

* Retrieve call logs from a managed device
* Retrieve SMS logs from a managed device
* Manipulate device blacklists / whitelists
* Retrieve and manipulate user account data

With so many API functions available, the CSRF vulnerabilities that were previously identified were of a much higher severity, putting the mobile devices being managed by SureMDM and the MDM system itself at risk of compromise.

### Unauthenticated Information Exposure: CVE-2018-15656

At this point, we had several highly sensitive resources as well as two vulnerabilities that could be used to reliably carry out cross-site request forgery attacks. To add to this, we were able to identify an API endpoint which did not require authentication and would confirm whether a specified e-mail address is registered against a user account within the SureMDM system.

By making a `GET` request to `/api/register/$1`, where `$1` is a base64 encoded e-mail address, the web server will respond with either `true` or `false` in the response body, indicating that the e-mail is in use or not.

In addition to specifying the e-mail address, it was also required that a `ApiKey` header be declared with the value `apiKey`. For example, to verify whether `jenny@8675309.ext` exists in the system, the below request would have to be made:

```
GET /api/register/amVubnlAODY3NTMwOS5leHQ= HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:65.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/65.0
Accept: application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Referer: http://127.0.0.1/console/?16.0
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
Content-Length: 0
Connection: close
ApiKey: apiKey

```

By utilising this information exposure, it further increases the chances of a successful phishing campaign paired up with the CSRF vulnerabilities.

### Server Side Request Forgery: CVE-2018-15657

Lastly, we were able to identify another unauthenticated endpoint which posed a more significant issue than the one documented in CVE-2018-15656. The resource we identified can be found at `/api/DownloadUrlResponse.ashx` and accepts user input via a query string parameter named `url`.

The URL provided in the `url` parameter will subsequently be requested by the web server and the content output in the response to the user. This opens up the possibility of cross-site scripting attacks, with complete evasion of the default protections in several browsers, as no markup is being passed via the URL; but rather the address of the resource to load:

![](/assets/img/2019-01-31-multiple-vulnerabilities-found-in-mobile-device-management-software/rfi.png)

In addition to being able to serve remote files from the SureMDM host, it was also possible to use this SSRF vulnerability to serve files from the local filesystem of the server. As the URI schema is not validated, `file://` URIs can be passed in the `url` parameter, such as `file://C:/WINDOWS/System32/drivers/etc/hosts`:

![](/assets/img/2019-01-31-multiple-vulnerabilities-found-in-mobile-device-management-software/lfi-hosts.png)

After enumerating some older documentation of SureMDM that we were able to find online, we identified the default install path of the IIS application, and confirmed that the vulnerability can be used to recover the SQL server credentials and other sensitive pieces of information within the `Web.config` and `webConnection.config` files:

![](/assets/img/2019-01-31-multiple-vulnerabilities-found-in-mobile-device-management-software/lfi-connections.png)

### What our clients say

> As a developer, I’ve often seen pen testing as little more than a checkbox exercise, where senior management bring in a big name who run some automated scans and give you a certificate at the end. Digital Interruption were different, they understood the domain and the architecture of the app which allowed them to test in a more thorough way which gave us a lot of confidence when talking to clients about the security of the app.

Chris Northwood; Lead Developer and author of The Full Stack Developer

> Reports were especially useful for our management to understand their business risks and for developers to quickly remediate the discovered vulnerabilities. Needless to say, our team was very thankful to have had the opportunity to work with Jahmel!

Senior Security Engineer; Company Name under NDA

> We really enjoyed working with Jahmel and the team on the pen test. They were extremely professional and diligent in their work, and their report was extensively detailed. Their knowledge of all matters security was second to none, and their advice proved invaluable to our business.

Kieran Innes; Co-founder and CTO at Tootoot | Forbes 30 under 30
