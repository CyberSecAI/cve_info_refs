Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-15468:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the incorrect handling of the `MSR_DEBUGCTL` register within the Xen hypervisor. Specifically, when vPMU (virtual Performance Monitoring Unit) is disabled, the hypervisor skips value checking for the `MSR_DEBUGCTL` register. This allows a guest operating system to set any arbitrary value for the register.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Lack of input validation**: The Xen hypervisor fails to properly validate the values written to the `MSR_DEBUGCTL` register by a guest when vPMU is disabled.
- **Incorrect virtualization of debugging features**: The hypervisor incorrectly allows a guest to control features like Branch Trace Store (BTS), which are not properly virtualized by the processor.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A malicious or buggy guest can exploit this vulnerability to lock up the entire host system. This is achieved by improperly configuring the Branch Trace Store, which can cause the core to hang.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Guest OS:**  The vulnerability can be triggered by a malicious or compromised guest OS running on the Xen hypervisor.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Guest administrator privileges:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges within a virtualized guest OS.
- **x86 HVM or PVH guests:** The exploit is only applicable to HVM (Hardware Virtual Machine) or PVH (Paravirtualized Hardware) guests. x86 PV (Paravirtualized) guests cannot trigger this vulnerability.
- **Intel CPUs:** The vulnerability only affects systems with Intel CPUs, ARM and AMD systems are not affected.

**Additional details:**
- The issue affects Xen versions 4.6 and later.
- The vulnerability is fixed by applying the provided patches.
