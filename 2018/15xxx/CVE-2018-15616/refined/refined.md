- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Deserialization vulnerability in the System Platform Web UI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated deserialization vulnerability leading to remote code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to potentially gain full control of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack; an unauthenticated user can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No authentication is required; attacker can be remote. The attack complexity is high.
