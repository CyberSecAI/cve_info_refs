```
Root cause of vulnerability: Incorrect access control and lack of authentication in salt-api leading to remote command execution.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Improper method call validation in salt-master's ClearFuncs class
- Missing authentication checks for certain methods
- Allows for remote command execution.

Impact of exploitation:
- Remote attackers can bypass authentication.
- Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on salt minions.
- Attackers can retrieve user tokens from the salt master.
-  Can lead to exfiltration of sensitive information, arbitrary code execution, or a denial of service.

Attack vectors:
- Network access to the salt-api endpoint.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Remote network access to the vulnerable salt-api endpoint.
- No authentication is required for some actions.
