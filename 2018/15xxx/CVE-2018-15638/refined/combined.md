## Description

[![@odony](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2039870?v=4&size=48)](/odony)[odony](https://github.com/odony)opened [on Dec 22, 2020](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/63703#issue-773033360)
# Security Advisory - [CVE-2018-15638](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3mhr-8gcj-264p "CVE-2018-15638")

**Affects**: Odoo 13.0 and earlier (Community and Enterprise Editions)

**CVE ID**: [CVE-2018-15638](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15638)

**Component**: Discuss

**Credits**: Subash SN and Bharath Kumar (Appsecco), Dipanshu Agrawal

Cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in mail module in Odoo Community 13.0

and earlier and Odoo Enterprise 13.0 and earlier, allows remote attackers

to inject arbitrary web script in the browser of a victim via crafted

channel names.

## I. Background

The Discuss module handles discussions and chats between users, and allows

any internal user to create new discussion channels.

## II. Problem Description

The channel attributes were not properly sanitized.

## III. Impact

**Attack Vector**: Network exploitable

**Authentication**: Employee / Internal user account required

**CVSS3 Score**: High :: 7.1

**CVSS3 Vector**: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

An attacker with an Employee / Internal user account could create a

specially-crafted channel and then add another user in order to execute

arbitrary web script in their browser. This could lead to privilege

escalation and execution of actions using the session of the victim.

Odoo S.A. is not aware of any use of this vulnerability in the wild.

## IV. Workaround

There is no known workaround, applying the patches is strongly recommended.

Odoo Cloud servers have been patched as soon as the correction was available.

## V. Solution

Apply the patches corresponding to your Odoo installation, or upgrade

to the latest revision, either via GitHub or by downloading the

latest version from <https://www.odoo.com/page/download>

or <http://nightly.odoo.com>

To apply the patch, change into the main directory of your Odoo

installation (the one containing "openerp" and "addons" directories),

then execute the patch command, typically:

```
   patch -p0 -f < /path/to/the_patch_file.patch

```

This command assumes your installation layout corresponds to

the latest source code layout of the Odoo project on GitHub.

If your installation differs, please extract the various patch

hunks from the files and apply them in the appropriate locations.

## VI. Correction details

The following list contains the revisions after which the vulnerability

is corrected:

* 11.0: [4179af6](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/4179af66f4c7665808dccf3e208615d7b92c9943)
* 12.0: [4827ef3](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/4827ef3ab24569db09513378e664d289b427fae3)
* 13.0: [0433588](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/0433588eb78f79dc3dcb1ef7d0d381a7ac1a6d13)
* 13.0-ent, 12.0-ent and 11.0-ent (Enterprise): see 13.0, 12.0 and 11.0.

## Description

[![@odony](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2039870?v=4&size=48)](/odony)[odony](https://github.com/odony)opened [on Dec 22, 2020](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/63703#issue-773033360)
# Security Advisory - [CVE-2018-15638](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3mhr-8gcj-264p "CVE-2018-15638")

**Affects**: Odoo 13.0 and earlier (Community and Enterprise Editions)

**CVE ID**: [CVE-2018-15638](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15638)

**Component**: Discuss

**Credits**: Subash SN and Bharath Kumar (Appsecco), Dipanshu Agrawal

Cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in mail module in Odoo Community 13.0

and earlier and Odoo Enterprise 13.0 and earlier, allows remote attackers

to inject arbitrary web script in the browser of a victim via crafted

channel names.

## I. Background

The Discuss module handles discussions and chats between users, and allows

any internal user to create new discussion channels.

## II. Problem Description

The channel attributes were not properly sanitized.

## III. Impact

**Attack Vector**: Network exploitable

**Authentication**: Employee / Internal user account required

**CVSS3 Score**: High :: 7.1

**CVSS3 Vector**: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

An attacker with an Employee / Internal user account could create a

specially-crafted channel and then add another user in order to execute

arbitrary web script in their browser. This could lead to privilege

escalation and execution of actions using the session of the victim.

Odoo S.A. is not aware of any use of this vulnerability in the wild.

## IV. Workaround

There is no known workaround, applying the patches is strongly recommended.

Odoo Cloud servers have been patched as soon as the correction was available.

## V. Solution

Apply the patches corresponding to your Odoo installation, or upgrade

to the latest revision, either via GitHub or by downloading the

latest version from <https://www.odoo.com/page/download>

or <http://nightly.odoo.com>

To apply the patch, change into the main directory of your Odoo

installation (the one containing "openerp" and "addons" directories),

then execute the patch command, typically:

```
   patch -p0 -f < /path/to/the_patch_file.patch

```

This command assumes your installation layout corresponds to

the latest source code layout of the Odoo project on GitHub.

If your installation differs, please extract the various patch

hunks from the files and apply them in the appropriate locations.

## VI. Correction details

The following list contains the revisions after which the vulnerability

is corrected:

* 11.0: [4179af6](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/4179af66f4c7665808dccf3e208615d7b92c9943)
* 12.0: [4827ef3](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/4827ef3ab24569db09513378e664d289b427fae3)
* 13.0: [0433588](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/0433588eb78f79dc3dcb1ef7d0d381a7ac1a6d13)
* 13.0-ent, 12.0-ent and 11.0-ent (Enterprise): see 13.0, 12.0 and 11.0.
