# CVE-2018-15758: Privilege Escalation in spring-security-oauth2

CRITICAL | OCTOBER 16, 2018 | CVE-2018-15758
# Description

Spring Security OAuth, versions 2.3 prior to 2.3.4, and 2.2 prior to 2.2.3, and 2.1 prior to 2.1.3, and 2.0 prior to 2.0.16, and older unsupported versions could be susceptible to a privilege escalation under certain conditions. A malicious user or attacker can craft a request to the approval endpoint that can modify the previously saved authorization request and lead to a privilege escalation on the subsequent approval. This scenario can happen if the application is configured to use a custom approval endpoint that declares `AuthorizationRequest` as a controller method argument.

This vulnerability exposes applications that meet all of the following requirements:

* Act in the role of an Authorization Server (e.g. `@EnableAuthorizationServer`)
* Use a custom Approval Endpoint that declares `AuthorizationRequest` as a controller method argument

This vulnerability does not expose applications that:

* Act in the role of an Authorization Server and use the default Approval Endpoint
* Act in the role of a Resource Server only (e.g. `@EnableResourceServer`)
* Act in the role of a Client only (e.g. `@EnableOAuthClient`)

# Affected Spring Products and Versions

* Spring Security OAuth 2.3 to 2.3.3
* Spring Security OAuth 2.2 to 2.2.2
* Spring Security OAuth 2.1 to 2.1.2
* Spring Security OAuth 2.0 to 2.0.15
* Older unsupported versions are also affected

# Mitigation

Users of affected versions should apply the following mitigation:

* 2.3.x users should upgrade to 2.3.4
* 2.2.x users should upgrade to 2.2.3
* 2.1.x users should upgrade to 2.1.3
* 2.0.x users should upgrade to 2.0.16
* Older versions should upgrade to a supported branch

There are no other mitigation steps required.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1643048#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2018-10-25 12:26:57 UTC  ```  Spring Security OAuth, versions 2.3 prior to 2.3.4, and 2.2 prior to 2.2.3, and 2.1 prior to 2.1.3, and 2.0 prior to 2.0.16, and older unsupported versions could be susceptible to a privilege escalation under certain conditions. A malicious user or attacker can craft a request to the approval endpoint that can modify the previously saved authorization request and lead to a privilege escalation on the subsequent approval. This scenario can happen if the application is configured to use a custom approval endpoint that declares AuthorizationRequest as a controller method argument.  External References:  <https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2018-15758>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1643048#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-08-08 10:08:39 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Fuse 7.4.0  Via RHSA-2019:2413 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2413](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2413)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1643048#c3)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-08-08 13:18:32 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2018-15758>   ``` |  |
