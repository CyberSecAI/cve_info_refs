{
  "CVE-2018-15758": {
    "Description": "Spring Security OAuth, versions 2.3 prior to 2.3.4, and 2.2 prior to 2.2.3, and 2.1 prior to 2.1.3, and 2.0 prior to 2.0.16, and older unsupported versions could be susceptible to a privilege escalation under certain conditions. A malicious user or attacker can craft a request to the approval endpoint that can modify the previously saved authorization request and lead to a privilege escalation on the subsequent approval. This scenario can happen if the application is configured to use a custom approval endpoint that declares `AuthorizationRequest` as a controller method argument.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from the ability to modify a previously saved authorization request via a crafted request to the approval endpoint.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper authorization request handling",
      "Lack of validation of the authorization request"
    ],
    "Impact": "A malicious user can escalate their privileges by modifying authorization requests, potentially granting themselves access to resources they shouldn't have.",
    "Attack vectors": "Crafting a malicious request to the application's custom approval endpoint.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the approval endpoint. The application must act as an Authorization Server with a custom Approval Endpoint that declares `AuthorizationRequest` as a controller method argument."
