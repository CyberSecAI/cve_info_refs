Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-15364:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the improper validation of user-supplied data when processing information from a named pipe within the `Ntrtscan.exe` process of Trend Micro OfficeScan.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Out-of-bounds Read:**  The lack of proper input validation allows an attacker to provide data that leads to a read operation beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer. This can result in information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially read sensitive information from the memory of the vulnerable process due to the out-of-bounds read.
- **Privilege Escalation (Indirect):** The advisory notes that an attacker can combine this vulnerability with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges to SYSTEM. However, the text doesn't specify what these other vulnerabilities are or how exactly they are combined with the current issue to achieve the escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Attack:** The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- **Named Pipe:** The vulnerability is triggered through the processing of data received via a named pipe.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have a foothold on the target machine, specifically the ability to execute low-privileged code on the affected system.
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted data to the named pipe used by the `Ntrtscan.exe` process.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information mentions that Trend Micro has released an update to address the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2018-04-25, and the advisory was released on 2018-08-30
