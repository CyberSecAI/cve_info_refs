Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-15370:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the presence of a hidden command in the Cisco IOS ROM Monitor (ROMMON) Software. This hidden command allows for unauthorized memory manipulation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Boot Process:** The primary weakness is the ability to bypass the Cisco Secure Boot validation checks.
- **Hidden Command:** The existence of a hidden command in the ROMMON software that allows writing to specific memory addresses without proper authorization.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The hidden command does not properly validate the input provided, enabling the writing of malicious data to memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypass Secure Boot:** An attacker can bypass signature validation checks of Cisco Secure Boot.
- **Load Compromised Image:** The attacker can load a compromised (not digitally signed by Cisco) software image on the affected device.
- **Full Compromise:** Successfully loading a compromised software image can lead to complete control of the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Physical Console Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the device's console port.
- **ROMMON Mode:** The attacker must force the device into ROMMON mode.
- **Memory Manipulation:** The attacker then needs to use the hidden command to write a malicious pattern to a specific memory address.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker must have physical access to the device and console access to interact with the device via a serial console connection.
- **Ability to Force ROMMON Mode:** The attacker must be able to interrupt the boot process to force the device to boot into ROMMON mode.
- **Knowledge of Hidden Command & Memory Address:** The attacker needs specific knowledge of the hidden command and the exact memory address to write to in order to exploit the vulnerability successfully.

**Additional Notes:**
- There are no workarounds for this vulnerability; a software update is required to fix it.
- The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
- The affected products include:
    - Catalyst 6800 Series Supervisor Engine 6T
    - Catalyst 6840-X Series Fixed Backbone Switches
    - Catalyst 6880-X Series Extensible Fixed Aggregation Switches
- The CVSS v3 base score is 6.4 (Medium) with the vector string: `CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`
