Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `index.php` file located at `/coreframe/app/admin/pay/admin/index.php`. Specifically, the `keyValue` parameter, received from the `GET` request, is directly incorporated into a SQL query without sufficient validation or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The core issue is the direct inclusion of the `$keyValue` variable into a SQL query, specifically within the `WHERE` clause of the query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. The vulnerable code section is:
    ```php
    $keyValue = strip_tags($GLOBALS['keyValue']);
    ...
    switch ($fieldtype) {
        case 0:
            $where .= " AND `order_no`='$keyValue'";
            break;
        case 1:
            $where .= " AND `telephone`='$keyValue'";
            break;
        case 2:
            $where .= " AND `kf_username`='$keyValue'";
            break;
        case 3:
            $where .= " AND `jxs_username`='$keyValue'";
            break;
    }
    ```
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** Although `strip_tags` is used on the `$keyValue`, this does not prevent SQL injection. It only removes HTML and PHP tags. It is insufficient to prevent malicious SQL payloads from being injected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Database Exposure:** A successful SQL injection attack can lead to the exposure of sensitive database information, including user credentials, financial data, and other confidential information.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could also modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** In some cases, SQL injection can be used to cause a denial of service by overloading the database server.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Gaining control over the database might allow attackers to pivot further into the system to achieve more malicious objectives, possibly remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted GET request to the vulnerable endpoint (`index.php`). The vulnerable parameter is `keyValue`.
*   **URL:** The vulnerable URL is provided as an example:
     `index.php?m=pay&f=index&v=listing&keytype=0&_su=wuzhicms&_menuid=36&search=&fieldtype=0&keyValue={sql payload}&status=&starttime=&endtime=`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs remote access to the application through the network.
*   **Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker must have some knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft the malicious payload.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable parameter (`keyValue`) within the URL structure.
*   **No Authentication Required:** Based on the provided code, it does not appear authentication is required, but access to the admin panel is likely.

**Additional Details:**

The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates the exploitation using the `updatexml` function in MySQL:

```
index.php?m=pay&f=index&v=listing&keytype=0&_su=wuzhicms&_menuid=36&search=&fieldtype=0&keyValue='+and+updatexml(7,concat(0x7e,now(),0x7e),7)%23&status=&starttime=&endtime=
```
This payload leverages a MySQL-specific function (`updatexml`) to expose the database version, demonstrating the ability to run arbitrary SQL queries.

The information provided offers a clear and complete picture of the SQL injection vulnerability, exceeding the level of detail typically found in a standard CVE description.
