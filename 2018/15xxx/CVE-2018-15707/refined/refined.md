Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2018-15707 and related vulnerabilities:

**CVE-2018-15707**

*   **Root cause:** A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the `bwmainleft.asp` page of Advantech WebAccess due to the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the `pname` GET parameter.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
    *   Reflected XSS
    *   Disclosure of session credentials (username and password) within the HTML source code, accessible via client-side JavaScript.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can steal user credentials by injecting malicious JavaScript code via the `pname` parameter. This can lead to unauthorized access to the WebAccess application.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript in the `pname` parameter.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to induce a user to click a specially crafted URL.

**Additional Information (from Tenable advisory TRA-2018-35 and Exploit-DB)**

*   The vulnerability exists in Advantech WebAccess/SCADA versions 8.3.1 and 8.3.2.
*   The vulnerability is related to the `bwmainleft.asp` page, which does not sanitize the `pname` GET parameter.
*   The credentials are included in the JavaScript code block.
*   The Tenable advisory groups this vulnerability with two other related vulnerabilities:
    *   **CVE-2018-15705:** WADashboard API `writeFile` authenticated directory traversal, which allows an attacker to write or overwrite any file on the file system. An attacker can use this to remotely execute arbitrary code.
    *   **CVE-2018-15706:** WADashboard API `readFile` authenticated directory traversal, which allows an attacker to read any file on the file system.

**CVE-2018-15705**

*   **Root cause:** A directory traversal vulnerability in the `writeFile` API of the WADashboard API.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
    *   Directory Traversal
    *   Lack of input validation for the `folderpath` parameter
    *   Ability to write/overwrite arbitrary files on the file system.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can write malicious files (e.g., ASP scripts) to the server, which can be used for remote code execution. Since the API process runs with Administrator privileges, files can be written to nearly any directory. The ASP script, when executed by the webserver, also runs with elevated privileges, allowing for OS command execution.
*   **Attack vectors:** An HTTP POST request to `/WADashboard/api/dashboard/v1/files/writeFile` with a crafted `folderpath` parameter to specify the write location and a `msg` parameter to specify the file content.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the WADashboard API with at least "restricted" privileges.

**CVE-2018-15706**

*   **Root cause:** A directory traversal vulnerability in the `readFile` API of the WADashboard API.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
    *   Directory Traversal
    *   Lack of input validation for the `filepath` parameter
    *   Ability to read arbitrary files on the file system.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read any file on the filesystem, which can lead to sensitive information disclosure.
*   **Attack vectors:** An HTTP GET request to `/WADashboard/api/dashboard/v1/files/readFile` with a crafted `filepath` parameter to specify the file to be read.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the WADashboard API with at least "restricted" privileges.

**Exploit Chain**

The Exploit-DB entry details how the three vulnerabilities can be chained together:
1.  The XSS vulnerability (CVE-2018-15707) is used to steal user credentials (username and password) of an authenticated user.
2.  These credentials are then used to authenticate to the WADashboard API.
3.  The `writeFile` directory traversal vulnerability (CVE-2018-15705) is used to write an ASP file (malicious payload) to the web server.
4.  The ASP script (malicious payload) is then executed to achieve remote code execution.

This exploit chain demonstrates how an attacker could escalate from an XSS vulnerability to full remote code execution using directory traversal.
