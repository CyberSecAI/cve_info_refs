Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the dynamic assignment of Security Group Tags (SGTs) during a wireless roam from one Service Set Identifier (SSID) to another within a Cisco TrustSec domain. Specifically, the authentication and authorization checking mechanisms in Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software are not properly handling SGT assignments during wireless roaming.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper authorization checking.
- Incorrect dynamic assignment of SGTs during wireless roaming.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain unauthorized network access to a Cisco TrustSec domain, potentially gaining privileged access that should be restricted under normal circumstances.
- Successful exploitation leads to a bypass of intended security policies.
- Attackers can obtain Security Group Tags (SGTs) from different SSIDs within the domain, which should not be possible.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A). The attacker needs to be within the same network segment (Layer 2 adjacent) as the vulnerable device.
- It is a network-based attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated (PR:L) to the wireless network.
- The attacker must be adjacent to the vulnerable Cisco WLC.
- The attacker must be able to initiate a wireless roam between SSIDs within the same TrustSec domain.

**Additional Notes:**
- There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is present in Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software.
- The vulnerability was found during internal security testing.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 5.4.
- Cisco has released software updates to address the issue.
