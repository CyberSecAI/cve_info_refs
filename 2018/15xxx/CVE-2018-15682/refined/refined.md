Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-15682:

**Root Cause:**
- Lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection when sending private messages.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- CSRF vulnerability: The application does not validate the origin of the request for sending private messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can trick an authenticated user into sending private messages to an arbitrary recipient.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page that includes a form targeting the private message sending functionality of the vulnerable application. The malicious form is automatically submitted when the user opens the page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to lure an authenticated user to visit the crafted malicious page. The attacker also needs to know a valid recipient user ID.
- The attacker does not need to interact directly with the vulnerable application. The attack relies on the victim's browser making the request after the victim is tricked into visiting the attacker's malicious web page.
