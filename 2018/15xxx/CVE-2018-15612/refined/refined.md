Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-15612:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The root cause is a lack of protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks in some administrative functions of Avaya Aura® Orchestration Designer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. This allows an attacker to potentially perform administrative actions without the user's knowledge or consent.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to add, change, or remove administrative settings. This could have severe consequences, potentially compromising the system's security and functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), requiring the user to be tricked into clicking a malicious link or visiting a compromised page.
*   The attack requires the victim to have an active authenticated session within the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious request that can be triggered by a legitimate user. 
*   The attacker does not need to have prior access to the application.
*   The attacker exploits the trust the application has for authenticated users by forcing their browser to send malicious requests to the application.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability affects Avaya Aura® Orchestration Designer versions 7.x through 7.2.1.
*   A patch is available in version 7.2.2 or later.
*   The vulnerability is classified as High severity with a CVSS v3 base score of 8.3.
*   The CVSS v3 vector string is `AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H` which means:
    *   **AV:N (Network):** Attack vector is via network
    *   **AC:H (High):** The attack complexity is high.
    *   **PR:N (None):** No privileges are required for the attacker.
    *   **UI:R (Required):** User interaction is required for successful exploitation.
    *   **S:C (Changed):** The scope of the vulnerability changes.
    *   **C:H (High):** Confidentiality impact is high.
    *   **I:H (High):** Integrity impact is high.
    *   **A:H (High):** Availability impact is high.
