Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-15853:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies within the expression evaluator in `src/xkbcomp/expr.c` of the `libxkbcommon` library.
- The issue arises during the evaluation of boolean expressions involving negation (e.g., `!True`).
- Instead of recursing to the underlying value being negated, the evaluator would recursively call itself with the same negated expression, leading to an infinite recursion. This infinite recursion would cause a stack overflow and crash the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Infinite recursion when evaluating boolean negation expressions.
- Stack overflow vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) is the primary impact.
- An attacker could crash applications using `libxkbcommon` by providing a specially crafted keymap file with the vulnerable boolean expression.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Attackers, specifically through a maliciously crafted keymap file.
- The vulnerability is triggered by the `xkbcomp` tool when parsing the crafted keymap file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to supply the crafted keymap file to a system or application using the vulnerable `libxkbcommon` library.
- Requires the ability to trigger the parsing of the malicious keymap (likely through an application that utilizes libxkbcommon for input or keyboard mappings).
- A local attacker that has the ability to supply a specifically crafted keymap file to an application using the vulnerable libxkbcommon would be enough to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is a bug that was inherited from the upstream xkbcomp project.
- It was identified through fuzzing using the AFL fuzzer.
- The fix was implemented by modifying the `ExprResolveBoolean` function within `src/xkbcomp/expr.c` to correctly recurse to the underlying value.
