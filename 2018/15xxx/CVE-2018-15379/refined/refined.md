Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-15379

**Root Cause:**
- Incorrect directory permission settings within the Cisco Prime Infrastructure (PI) HTTP web server. Specifically, important system directories have unrestricted permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** The unrestricted directory permissions allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to upload arbitrary files to the system.
- **Command Execution:** The uploaded files can be executed with the privileges of the `prime` user.
- **TFTP Vulnerability:** The vulnerability can be exploited by uploading a malicious file using TFTP, which is accessible through the web interface GUI and enabled by default.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the targeted Cisco PI system.
- **Compromised System:** The attacker gains the ability to run commands with the privileges of the `prime` user. The `prime` user does not have root access but has access to execute the runrshell script that can bypass execution restrictions.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Through the exploitation of a separate SUID binary vulnerability, an attacker can achieve root access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network:** The attack is performed over the network.
- **TFTP:** The attacker utilizes the TFTP protocol to upload malicious files.
- **Web Interface:** The TFTP functionality is accessed through the web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Cisco PI instance.
- **No Credentials:** The attacker does not need any valid credentials.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerability, including the TFTP upload path, and the ability to craft the appropriate exploit.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco PI Software Releases 3.2 through 3.4 prior to the first fixed release.
- The TFTP server is enabled by default in the affected versions of Cisco PI.
- Cisco PI Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) image has TFTP disabled by default
- The vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling the TFTP server on the Cisco PI appliance.
- A Metasploit module has been developed to automate the exploitation of this vulnerability, including privilege escalation to root via a SUID binary.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 7.3 (HIGH).
