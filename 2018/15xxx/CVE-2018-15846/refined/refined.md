The provided content describes a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in fledrCMS, specifically related to changing the administrator's password.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of CSRF protection in the `index.php?p=done&savedata=1` endpoint. This endpoint allows password changes without verifying the origin of the request.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSRF: The application is vulnerable to CSRF attacks, where an attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into performing unintended actions (in this case, changing their password).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can change the administrator's password, potentially leading to complete control over the CMS. This would allow the attacker to modify content, install malicious code, and cause other damage.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can create a malicious webpage (like the provided `one.html` file) that includes a form that automatically submits a password change request to the vulnerable endpoint.
- The attacker can then trick a logged-in administrator into visiting this malicious page (e.g., through social engineering).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting a malicious webpage.
- The administrator must be logged into fledrCMS when the request is made.
- The attacker does not need to have any prior access to the system or the administrator's credentials.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided HTML PoC demonstrates how an attacker could craft a page to change the password to "19971106".
- The vulnerable endpoint is `index.php?p=done&savedata=1`.
