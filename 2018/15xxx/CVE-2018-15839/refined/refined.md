{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow in the handling of the Authorization HTTP header or the SessionID cookie, when a long string is provided.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Buffer Overflow"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (DoS). The router will automatically log out and the network connection will be lost, requiring a reboot to restore functionality.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through an HTTP request with an overly long Authorization header or SessionId cookie.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable D-Link DIR-615 router and be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests."
