- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the configuration of the Shell Access Filter, when used with a specific type of remote authentication. This configuration leads to unbounded writes to a system file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unbounded writes to a system file, specifically a log file, leading to excessive disk space consumption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to the lack of available disk space, potentially causing the device to function abnormally and become unstable.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a steady stream of remote authentication requests to the appliance.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to send remote authentication requests to the vulnerable Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) appliance. No prior authentication or specific privileges are required.
