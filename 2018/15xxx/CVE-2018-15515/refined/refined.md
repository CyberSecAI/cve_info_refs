- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The D-Link Central WiFiManager (CWM-100) version 1.03 r0098 loads a malicious DLL file named `quserex.dll` if present in the `CaptivelPortal.exe` directory and executes it with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software loads and executes a DLL file from a non-protected location without proper validation. This is a classic case of DLL hijacking or planting.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges leading to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to place a malicious `quserex.dll` file in the `CaptivelPortal.exe` directory and restart the CaptivePortal service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access to the system to place the malicious DLL file.
