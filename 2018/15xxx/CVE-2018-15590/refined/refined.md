Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Ivanti Workspace Control software fails to properly restrict access to protected folders when accessed through a `localhost` UNC path. The Data Security feature uses a path blacklist and does not account for the UNC paths, thus allowing bypass.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Data Security Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass the Data Security feature of Ivanti Workspace Control, which is designed to restrict access to specific files and folders.
- **UNC path traversal:** The software doesn't consider UNC paths (specifically `\\localhost\c$\secret`) when enforcing Data Security policies, allowing access through an alternate path.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** A local attacker can access files and folders that should be protected by Data Security.
- **Data Exposure:** Depending on the underlying NTFS permissions, sensitive data within these protected folders could be exposed to unauthorized local users.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, requiring an attacker to have local access to the machine where Ivanti Workspace Control is running.
- **UNC Path Exploitation:** The attacker utilizes a localhost UNC path to bypass restrictions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system with the vulnerable Ivanti Workspace Control installation.
- **Basic understanding of Windows paths:** The attacker needs to understand the concept of UNC paths and how to use them to access files and folders on the local system.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was confirmed on Ivanti Workspace Control versions 10.2.700.1 and 10.2.950.0.
- It was resolved in version 10.3.0.0.
