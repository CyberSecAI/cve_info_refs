The content relates to CVE-2018-15870.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
An invalid memory address dereference occurs in the `getName` function, which is called from `decompileGETVARIABLE` during the processing of a SWF file. This dereference happens because the code attempts to access a memory location that is either invalid or doesn't belong to the program. The crash occurs when processing a specific SWF file (014-unknown-def-swf-398).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Invalid memory address dereference.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) due to program crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- Processing a crafted SWF file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted SWF file.
