{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an unchecked NULL pointer dereference in the `ExprResolveLhs` function within `xkbcomp/expr.c`. This occurs when parsing invalid atoms in a keymap file, specifically when the `xkb_atom_text` function fails and returns NULL, which is not properly handled.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unchecked NULL pointer usage"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability by supplying a crafted keymap file, leading to a NULL pointer dereference and a crash of the `xkbcommon` parser, resulting in a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local attacker supplying a crafted keymap file."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to supply a crafted keymap file to the vulnerable system.",
     "cve_id": "CVE-2018-15859"
  }
