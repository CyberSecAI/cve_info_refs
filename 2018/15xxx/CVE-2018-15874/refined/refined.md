{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The D-Link DIR-615 router does not properly sanitize the hostname received via DHCP, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper input sanitization on the hostname field from DHCP.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the router's web interface via DHCP. This could lead to various attacks, such as session hijacking, defacement of the web interface, or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a crafted DHCP request with a malicious hostname to the router. This is typically done from a local network.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be on the same local network as the vulnerable router and be able to send DHCP requests. They would need the MAC address of their network interface and knowledge of the router's local IP address to successfully conduct the attack."
