The provided content includes information about CVE-2018-15807, which is a vulnerability in POSIM EVO for Windows.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application includes an "Emergency Override" administrative account that can be accessed through a deterministic algorithm.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The override feature uses a locally computed, deterministic code, allowing attackers to generate the code and bypass the login prompt.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Bypassing the login prompt allows attackers to access the administrative account and gain unauthorized access to the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can generate the override code using the deterministic algorithm.
- This code can be used to bypass the login prompt through the "override" feature.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the application's login prompt.
- The attacker needs to understand or reverse-engineer the deterministic algorithm.
