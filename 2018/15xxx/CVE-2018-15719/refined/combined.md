# [R1] Open Dental Multiple Vulnerabilities

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

### CVE-2018-15717: Weak Password Hashing

Open Dental stores credentials in an insecure manner.

The application stores credentials in the "userod" table with the username in plaintext and the password hash stored as a base64 encoded MD5 hash, which is a known insecure hashing method. Furthermore, no salt is used with the hash.

### CVE-2018-15718: User Table Information Disclosure

Open Dental transmits credential information in an insecure manner.

When the application launches and a user is presented with a log-in prompt, the application sends a request to the database for all user information. This includes usernames, privilege levels, password hashes, etc. This unnecessarily exposes user information.

![](/sites/drupal.dmz.tenablesecurity.com/files/files/advisory/creds.png)
### CVE-2018-15719: Default Database Credentials

Open Dental contains a security bypass due to insecure installation defaults.

Upon installation of the application, the mysql database created has the default credentials of "root" with a blank password. This allows anyone on the network with access to the server to access all database information (including confidential patient information and PII).

[CVE-2016-6531](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6531) was previously assigned to this issue. However, Open Dental disputed the vulnerability. According to the release notes of 18.4, Open Dental will now "prompt to create a username and password for MySQL."

### Solution

Open Dental Software has reported that the vulnerabilities are fixed in version 18.4.0.
