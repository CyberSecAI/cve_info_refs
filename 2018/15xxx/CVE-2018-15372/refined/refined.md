- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A logic error in the Cisco IOS XE Software when handling MACsec Key Agreement (MKA) using Extensible Authentication Protocol-Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass authentication when a Layer 3 interface is configured for MACsec MKA using EAP-TLS and is running in *access-session closed* mode. Specifically, it's a logic error within the authentication process that can be exploited.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker can bypass 802.1x network access controls and gain access to the network. The attacker can pass traffic through the affected Layer 3 interface.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to be adjacent to the affected device. They must connect to and pass traffic through a Layer 3 interface that is misconfigured.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker must be adjacent to the vulnerable device and capable of sending traffic to a Layer 3 interface. They do not need any prior authentication to the network.
