Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2018-15750:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a directory traversal issue within the `salt-api` component of SaltStack Salt. Specifically, it arises when handling queries to `/run` or `/events` endpoints.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The `salt-api` fails to properly sanitize file paths when processing requests, allowing attackers to potentially access files beyond the intended directories.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit this flaw to determine the existence of arbitrary files on the server. This capability can be used to gather sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via network access to the `salt-api` service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the server running `salt-api`.
*   **No Authentication Required:**  The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication with `salt-api`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is described as allowing an attacker to "determine what files exist on a server when querying /run or /events." This implies that the attacker can't necessarily read the content of arbitrary files, but the ability to check for existence can be a significant step in an attack.
*   The advisory from SaltStack indicates that this issue was fixed in versions 2017.7.8 and 2018.3.3.
*   Several sources also note that this vulnerability is closely linked to CVE-2018-15751, which is also a security issue in `salt-api`.
