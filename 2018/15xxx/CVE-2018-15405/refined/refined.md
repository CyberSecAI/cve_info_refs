Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-15405

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an authorization check within the web interface of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) Supervisor and Cisco UCS Director. This check fails to properly account for the access level of the web interface user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Improper Authorization:** The core issue is the inadequate authorization mechanism that doesn't correctly restrict access based on user privileges. This allows users to potentially bypass intended access controls.
*   **Information Disclosure:** This vulnerability exposes sensitive information belonging to other users due to the faulty authorization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Information Access:** An attacker with valid, but low-privileged application credentials, can gain access to sensitive data of other users by sending crafted HTTP requests to the web interface.
*   **Reconnaissance Attacks:** The attacker can leverage the disclosed information to perform further reconnaissance activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack is initiated via the network (AV:N).
*   **Crafted HTTP Requests:** The attacker sends specifically crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must possess valid, but potentially low-privileged, application credentials for Cisco IMC Supervisor or Cisco UCS Director.
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability remotely by sending network requests to the affected web interface.
