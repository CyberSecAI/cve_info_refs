*[NOTE: This bug is part of a series of three related Android bugs with the same root cause: [CVE-2018-9489](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2018/08/29/sensitive-data-exposure-via-wifi-broadcasts-in-android-os-cve-2018-9489/), [CVE-2018-9581](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2018/11/11/cve-2018-9581/) and [CVE-2018-15835](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2018/11/11/cve-2018-15835/). [A presentation](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2018/11/05/speaking-bsidesde-this-friday-on-android-privacy-bugs-cve-2018-9489-cve-2018-9581-and-cve-2018-15835/) covering all three bugs was given at BSides DE in the fall of 2018.]*

# Summary

**System broadcasts by the Android operating system expose detailed information about the battery.** Prior research has demonstrated that the same charging information – when exposed via browser battery status API – can be used to uniquely identify and track users. As the result, the battery API was removed from most browsers.

On Android however, this information is made available with high precision. Furthermore, no special permission is required by any application to access this information. **As the result, this can be used to uniquely identify and track users across multiple apps.** This was verified via limited testing to be possible within a short period of time.

**Android versions 5.0 and later** are affected. The vendor (Google) does not classify this bug as a security issue and has not released any fix plans. **CVE-2018-15835** has been assigned by MITRE to track this issue. Further research is also recommended to see whether this is being exploited in the wild.

# Background

**Android** is an open source operating system developed by **Google** for mobile phones and tablets. It is estimated that over two billion devices exist worldwide running Android. Applications on Android are usually segregated by the OS from each other and the OS itself. However, interaction between processes and/or the OS is still possible via several mechanisms.

In particular, Android provides the use of “**Intents**” as one of the ways for inter-process communication. A broadcast using an “Intent” allows an application or the OS to send a message system-wide which can be listened to by other applications. While functionality exists to restrict who is allowed to read such messages, application developers often neglect to implement these restrictions properly or mask sensitive data. This leads to a common vulnerability within Android applications where a malicious application running on the same device can spy on and capture messages being broadcast by other applications.

Another security mechanism present in the Android is **permissions**. These are safeguards designed to protect the privacy of users. Applications must explicitly request access to certain information or features via a special “**uses-permission**” tag in the application manifest (“**AndroidManifest.xml**”). Depending on the type of permission (“normal”, “dangerous”, etc”) the OS may display the permission information to the user during installation, or may prompt again during run-time. Some permissions can only be used by system applications and cannot be used by regular developers.

Screenshots of application permissions in Google Play and at run-time:

![pic3](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pic3.png?w=169&h=300) ![pic4](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pic4.png?w=169&h=300) ![pic6](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pic6.png?w=169&h=300)

# Vulnerability Details

The Android OS broadcasts information about the battery system-wide on a regular basis including charging level, voltage and temperature. No special permission is needed to access this information. This is exposed via the “**android.intent.action.BATTERY\_CHANGED**” intent and is only available on **Android 5.0 or later**. The same information is also available via Android’s **BatteryManager** without a special permission.

A similar capability existed in browsers via W3C’s Battery Status API. However, extensive research by Łukasz Olejnik et al. showed that this API can be used to fingerprint devices, thus leading to tracking of users. Additional research revealed this being used in the wild by multiple websites, and the API was removed from most web browsers as the result.

In our limited testing we were able to distinguish devices located behind the same NAT device within a short period of time, thus leading to session re-spawning, but we were not yet able to replicate all the prior research regarding the HTML5 battery status API. This testing was based on the uniqueness of the current battery charging counter as being different across defines.

As the result, the same privacy issues that applied in the original Battery Status API should apply for Android applications resulting in applications being able to fingerprint and track users, and re-spawn session across multiple apps on the same device. Further research is needed to see if this is being actively exploited in the wild.

# Steps to Replicate by Regular Users

For Android device users, you can replicate these issues as follows:

1. Install [the “Internal Broadcasts Monitor” application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=lt.andro.broadcastlogger) developed by Vilius Kraujutis from Google Play.
2. Open the application and tap “Start” to monitor broadcasts.
3. Observe system broadcasts, specifically “android.net.wifi.STATE\_CHANGE” and “android.net.wifi.p2p.THIS\_DEVICE\_CHANGED”.

Screenshot example:

![text](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/text.png?w=175&h=300)

# Steps to Replicate by Developers via Code

To replicate this in code, create a Broadcast receiver and register it to receive the action “android.intent.action.BATTERY\_CHANGE”). Sample code appears below:

```
public class MainActivity extends Activity {
@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle state) {
    IntentFilter filter = new IntentFilter();
    filter.addAction(
	android.intent.action.BATTERY_CHANGE);
    registerReceiver(receiver, filter);
}

BroadcastReceiver receiver = new BroadcastReceiver() {
@Override
public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
    Log.d(intent.toString());
    ….
}
};
```
# Vendor Response and Mitigation

The vendor (Google) classified this issue as “NSBC” = “Not Security Bulletin Class” – meaning ““It was rated as not being a security vulnerability that would meet the severity bar for inclusion in an Android security bulletin.” **CVE-2018-15835** was assigned by the vendor for tracking. No fix is yet available.

# [Insecure Bootstrap Process in Google’s Cloud SQL Proxy](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2023/03/19/insecure-bootstrap-process-in-googles-cloud-sql-proxy/)

[March 19, 2023](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2023/03/19/insecure-bootstrap-process-in-googles-cloud-sql-proxy/) [nightwatchcyber](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/author/nightwatchcyber/)

## Summary

The bootstrap process for Google’s cloud SQL Proxy CLI uses the “curl | bash” pattern and didn’t document a way to verify authenticity of the downloaded binaries. The vendor updated documentation with information on how to use checksums to verify the downloaded binaries.

## Vulnerability Details

[As part of our ongoing research into supply chain attacks](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2021/07/12/speaking-appsec_village-defcon-29/), we have been analyzing bash installer scripts using the “curl | bash” pattern. [Google provides such script](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-sql-proxy#installation) used to install the Cloud SQL proxy. However, the documentation doesn’t indicate how to verify downloaded files prior to execution.

## Vendor Response

The vendor [updated their documentation](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-sql-proxy/pull/1676/files) with information on how to verify downloaded binaries via checksums.

# [GitBleed – Finding Secrets in Mirrored Git Repositories – CVE-2022-24975](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2022/02/11/gitbleed/)

[February 11, 2022July 2, 2024](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2022/02/11/gitbleed/) [nightwatchcyber](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/author/nightwatchcyber/)

## Summary

Due to a discrepancy in Git behavior, partial parts of a source code repository are visible when making copies via the [“git clone”](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone) command. There are additional parts of the repository that only become visible when using the “–mirror” option. This can lead to secrets being exposed via git repositories when not removed properly, and a false sense of security when repositories are scanned for secrets against a cloned, non-mirrored copy.

Attackers and bug bounty hunters can use this discrepancy in Git behavior to find hidden secrets and other sensitive data in public repositories.

Organizations can mitigate this by analyzing a fuller copy of their repositories using the “–mirror” option and remove sensitive data using tools like [BFG](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) or [git-filter-repo](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo) (which do a more thorough job).

MITRE assigned [CVE-2022-24975](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24975) to track this issue.

***[ADDED APRIL 2022: This bug is NOT the same as [NotGitBleed](https://www.notgitbleed.com/) – see their website here]***

**[ADDED JULY 2024: [A more in-depth article](https://www.aquasec.com/blog/undetected-hard-code-secrets-expose-corporations/) on this issue from AquaSec]**

## Technical Details

Git is a popular open source tool used for version control of source code. When users make a copy of a local or remote git repository, they use the [“git clone”](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone) command. However, this command doesn’t copy all of the data in the originating repository such as deleted branches and commits. On the other hand, there is a “–mirror” option which copies more parts of the repository. The discrepancy between the two behaviors can lead to secrets and other sensitive data lingering in the original repository. Additionally, existing tools for secrets detection often operate on cloned repositories and do not detect secrets in the mirror portion of the repository unless cloned via the “–mirror” command.

**[ADDED July 2024: More technical details [are available in this blog post from AquaSec](https://www.aquasec.com/blog/undetected-hard-code-secrets-expose-corporations/)]**

We also tested forking in GitHub and GitLab, and in both systems forking uses the regular “git clone” behind the scenes and not the “–mirror” version. That means that repositories containing secrets in the mirrored portion will not propagate those secrets to their forks.

MITRE assigned [CVE-2022-24975](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24975) to track this issue.

We provide two examples of repositories containing hidden secrets that are only visible when cloning with the “–mirror” option. These can be found here:

* [gb\_testrepo\_delete](https://github.com/nightwatchcybersecurity/gb_testrepo_delete) – secret is retained after a branch is deleted
* [gb\_testrepo\_reset](https://github.com/nightwatchcybersecurity/gb_testrepo_reset) – secret is retained after the git history is reset

If you try to clone the repository without the “–mirror” option, and retrieve the secret, it will not work:

![](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/delete_clone.png?w=605)

And:

![](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/reset_clone.png?w=605)

If you try the same with the “–mirror” option, you can now retrieve the secret (also note the larger number of objects retrieved):

![](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/delete_mirror.png?w=669)

And:

![](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/reset_mirror.png?w=669)

If you run [gitleaks](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks) on the cloned repositories, no secrets are found:

![](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/gitleaks_delete_clone.png?w=314)
![](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/gitleaks_delete_mirror.png?w=314)

However, running [gitleaks](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks) on the mirrored copies, finds the secrets stashed in deleted areas:

![](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/gitleaks_reset_mirror.png?w=437)
## Tooling

There are plenty of existing tools out there that can manipulate git repositories, scan them for secrets and remove specific commits. During our research, we used git for checking out repositories, [git-filter-repo](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo) for figuring out the delta between cloned and mirrored copies of the same repository, and [gitleaks](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks) to scan for secrets.

For examples on how to use these tools, please see sample scripts that we have [published to GitHub](https://github.com/nightwatchcybersecurity/gitbleed_tools).

## Mitigations

Organizations can mitigate this by analyzing a larger part of their repositories using the “–mirror” option and remove sensitive data using tools like [BFG](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) or [git-filter-repo](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo). Garbage collection and pruning in git is also recommended.

Organizations should not analyze regular cloned copies (without the “–mirror” option) since that may provide a false sense of security, and should not rely on methods of removing secrets such as deleting a branch or rewinding history via the “[git reset](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reset)” command.

## Branding

[![logo](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/gitbleed_icon-3.png?w=383)](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/gitbleed_icon-3.png)

There seems to be a recent trend to name vulnerabilities. While we think it’s silly, why not go with the flow?

Therefore we named this one “**GitBleed**“, since it leads to bleeding of secrets from repositories – with [a mirrored logo](https://github.com/nightwatchcybersecurity/gitbleed_tools/blob/main/gitbleed_icon.png) since it involves mirrored repositories.

# [Insecure Bootstrap Process in Oracle Cloud CLI](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2022/02/06/insecure-bootstrap-process-in-oracle-cloud-cli/)

[February 6, 2022](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2022/02/06/insecure-bootstrap-process-in-oracle-cloud-cli/) [nightwatchcyber](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/author/nightwatchcyber/)
[Research](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/category/research/)
[oracle](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/oracle/)

## Summary

The bootstrap process for Oracle Cloud CLI using the “curl | bash” pattern was insecure since there was no way to verify authenticity of the downloaded binaries. The vendor is now publishing checksums that can be used to verify the downloaded binaries.

## Vulnerability Details

[As part of our ongoing research into supply chain attacks](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2021/07/12/speaking-appsec_village-defcon-29/), we have been analyzing bash installer scripts using the “curl | basj” pattern. [Oracle provides such script](https://github.com/oracle/oci-cli#linux) used to install the CLI command for interaction with Oracle Cloud. However, there was no way to check whether the files that the script downloads are legitimate, which could potentially open the end-user to supply chain attacks. The installer is run as follows:

```
bash -c "$(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/oci-cli/master/scripts/install/install.sh)"
```
## Vendor Response

The vendor [started publishing SHA-256](https://github.com/oracle/oci-cli/releases) checksums for the CLI.

# [Three Reasons Why Log4J Is So Bad: Ubiquity, Severity and Exploitability](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2021/12/31/three-reasons-why-log4j-is-so-bad-ubiquity-severity-and-exploitability/)

[December 31, 2021December 30, 2021](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2021/12/31/three-reasons-why-log4j-is-so-bad-ubiquity-severity-and-exploitability/) [nightwatchcyber](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/author/nightwatchcyber/)
[Opinion](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/category/opinion/)
[log4j](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/log4j/)

Over the last few weeks, security teams everywhere have been busy patching [Log4J vulnerabilities](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html). In this article we want to talk about the three things you can tell your friends why this is way worse.

## Ubiquity

This vulnerability impacts impacts Java applications and those can be found almost anywhere: enterprise, vendor applications, database drivers, Android phones and even the smartchip on the credit card in your wallet ([Java Card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Card)). Additionally, majority of Java applications use log4j to handle logging, often involving user input. While your phone is [probably not exploitable](https://security.googleblog.com/2021/12/apache-log4j-vulnerability.html), the sheer number of places where log4j can be hiding makes this is hard to fix.

## Severity

There are vulnerabilities that come out all the time, but few of them reach the highest possible level of severity: remote code execution (RCE) and this one hits that ticket. That means that every server running Java within your company becomes everyone’s computer – an attacker can run anything they want there and then use that as a springboard to tunnel in further.

## Exploitability

There are many severe vulnerabilities out there that require specialized knowledge to exploit including speaking dead computer languages and building weird binaries during a full moon. With this one, you can begin the exploit [by copy/pasting a tweet into a search bar combined with DNS](https://scotthelme.co.uk/responding-to-the-log4j-2-vulnerability/).

# [WhatsApp for Android Retains Deleted Contacts Locally](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2021/12/30/whatsapp-for-android-retains-deleted-contacts-locally/)

[December 30, 2021](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2021/12/30/whatsapp-for-android-retains-deleted-contacts-locally/) [nightwatchcyber](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/author/nightwatchcyber/)
[Advisories](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/category/advisories/), [Research](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/category/research/)
[facebook](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/facebook/), [whatsapp](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/whatsapp/)

## Summary

WhatApp for Android retains contact info locally after contacts get deleted. This would allow an attacker with physical access to the device to check if the WhatsApp user had interactions with specific contacts, even though they have been deleted.

## Vulnerability Details

When a contact is deleted on WhatsApp, their information about security code changes is retained (while the chat content is not). The only way to get rid of that is to select “Clear Chat” for the contact before deleting it. Even deleting the chat itself doesn’t do it unless the “Clear Chat” operation is done first. [The “security code change notifications” option](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/security-code-change-notification/?lang=en) must be enabled in order for this to work.

Someone getting access to the user’s device can figure out whether they ever chatted with specific contacts, even if those contacts and their chats are no longer on the device. This is a privacy issue – especially for people like journalists and those living in dangerous countries.

Since WhatsApp uses Android’s contact app for contact information but supports chats with numbers that aren’t contacts, our theory is that the application retains information about security code changes even for contacts no longer on the device. There seems to be a discrepancy between how the “Clear chat” option and “Delete Chat” options are implemented in the application, with the first option deleting security notification data.

To reproduce:

1. Delete a chat with a contact that had security code changes before.
2. Delete the contact from the device via the Android Contacts app.
3. Re-add contact to the device via the Android Contacts app.
4. Start a new chat in WhatsApp with that contact but do not send any messages.
5. Observe that security code changes are listed with dates in the chat.
6. Select “Clear Chat” to remove the security code changes, and repeat sterps 1-4. Observe that the security code changes no longer appear.

![](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/screen-shot-2021-12-30-at-4.13.16-pm.png?w=612)

Tested on WhatsApp for Android, app version 2.21.20.20, running on Android 12.

## Vendor Response

We haven’t retested on a more recent version but our recommendation to users is to use the “Clear Chat” option in order to prevent this.

The vendor will not be fixing this issue, here is their response:

> *As part of the attack scenario you describe getting access to a person’s WhatsApp account to obtain private data, as you mention yourself, people do have a way to remove these messages from their account, if a bad actor gets access to their WhatsApp account prior to that person deleting that information then they will be able to view this information. As such, we are closing this report.*

# [Open Redirect Vulnerability in Substack](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2021/08/22/open-redirect-vulnerability-in-substack/)

[August 22, 2021](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2021/08/22/open-redirect-vulnerability-in-substack/) [nightwatchcyber](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/author/nightwatchcyber/)
[Advisories](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/category/advisories/)
[substack](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/substack/)

## Summary

Substack had a open redirect vulnerability in their login flow which would have allowed an attacker to facilitate phishing attacks. The vendor has deployed a fix for this issue.

## Vulnerability Details

Substack is an online platform that allows users to create and operate free and paid subscription newsletters. This platform had an open redirect vulnerability in its login flow which would redirect users to any sites after login completed. This could have been used by an attacker to facilitate phishing attacks targeting Substack users and steal their credentials.

The vulnerability was due to the fact that the “redirect parameter” in the login flow wasn’t been validated to make sure that the redirect only goes to a specific set of URLs. The attacker could specify their own redirect URL as follows:

```
https://substack.com/sign-in?redirect=https://www.google.com
```

See screenshots below:

## Vendor Response

Once a correct reporting channel was established, the issue was reported to the vendor and a fix was deployed limited the redirect parameter to Substack-specific URLs.

# [Firebase CLI Installer Making Calls to Google Analytics](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2021/05/25/firebase-cli-installer-making-calls-to-google-analytics/)

[May 25, 2021May 25, 2021](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2021/05/25/firebase-cli-installer-making-calls-to-google-analytics/) [nightwatchcyber](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/author/nightwatchcyber/)
[Research](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/category/research/)
[analytics](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/analytics/), [firebase](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/firebase/), [google](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/google/)

[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is a mobile and web application development platform provided by Google. One of the tools available for the platform is the [Firebase CLI tool](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools)) which helps developers interact with the platform from command line. [An automatic install script](https://firebase.tools) is offered among other options, which allows installation of the CLI tool via the “curl | bash” pattern as follows:

```
curl -sL https://firebase.tools | bash
```

[As part of our ongoing research](https://github.com/nightwatchcybersecurity/dont_curl_and_bash) into supply chain attacks, we have been looking into bash installer scripts that make calls to external systems. First, there is no way to verify that the installer is legit, However, to our surprise, we also found that this script makes calls to Google Analytics as part of the installation process. There is no sensitive data being collected but Google may still be collecting IP addresses of users installing the CLI. The source code for the installer script can be found here:

<https://firebase.tools/>

While this can be disabled, the documentation to do so is hard to find and is embedded within the installer script itself. We hope that Google will make this documentation more clear in the future. In any case, here is the documentation:

![](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/screen-shot-2021-05-25-at-8.08.40-am.png?w=630)

The actual code that makes these calls can be found here:

![](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/screen-shot-2021-05-25-at-8.10.15-am.png?w=625)

And here are all the analytics events triggered within the script:

```

send_analytics_event start
...
send_analytics_event uninstall_npm
...
send_analytics_event uninstall
...
send_analytics_event already_installed
...

# [New Tools for Addressing Supply Chain Attacks](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2021/05/09/new-tools-for-addressing-supply-chain-attacks/)

[May 9, 2021](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2021/05/09/new-tools-for-addressing-supply-chain-attacks/) [nightwatchcyber](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/author/nightwatchcyber/)
[Research](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/category/research/), [Tools](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/category/tools/)
[supplychainattack](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/supplychainattack/)

In the recent [codecov.io security incident](https://about.codecov.io/security-update/), an attacker modified a shell script used by a common software development tool for code coverage. This modification did not take place at the original source code repository where it would have been visible to others, but after the code was packaged and placed on the web server from which it was served.

Prompted by this incident, we are now releasing new tools that provide information and detection of similar attacks against other projects. The scope is limited to attacks that modify the released code and do not touch the original source code. The following tools are now available:

* **[dont\_curl\_and\_bash](https://github.com/nightwatchcybersecurity/dont_curl_and_bash)** – a list of projects that are installed directly off the Internet via a “curl | bash” manner along with possible mitigations
* **[icetrust](https://github.com/nightwatchcybersecurity/icetrust)** – a tool that can be used to verify a downloaded artifact such as a shell script before it is executed via methods such as checksums and PGP signatures
* **[release\_auditor](https://github.com/nightwatchcybersecurity/release_auditor)** – a tool that can be used to check if a GitHub release was modified after initial publication (see [our earlier blog post](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2021/04/25/supply-chain-attacks-via-github-com-releases/) for additional information)

Additionally, we are also providing two examples of how a continuous monitoring dashboard can be setup to detect such attacks by project maintainers. The following are available (screenshots below):

* [Simple one page dashboard](https://icetrust_dashboard.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/) (GitHub [repo](https://github.com/nightwatchcybersecurity/icetrust_dashboard_example))
* [Uptime / status-page like dashboard](https://icetrust_uptime.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/) (GitHub [repo](https://github.com/nightwatchcybersecurity/icetrust_uptime_example))

# Summary

**System broadcasts by the Android operating system expose WiFi signal strength information (RSSI).** Any application on the device can capture this information **without additional permissions**. Rogue applications can potentially use this information for indoor positioning in order to locate or track users within a small area near the WiFi router. Same issue also applies to the underlying Android API, although an additional permission is required.

**All versions of Android are believed to be affected.** ~~The vendor (Google) has not yet fixed this issue~~, The vendor (Google) has fixed this issue in Android 10 / Q, however on Android 9 / P one of the two broadcast types is no longer revealing sensitive data (as part of the fix for CVE-2018-9489). The vendor assigned **CVE-2018-9581** to track this issue. Further research is also recommended to see whether this is being exploited in the wild.

# Background

**Android** is an open source operating system developed by **Google** for mobile phones and tablets. It is estimated that over two billion devices exist worldwide running Android. Applications on Android are usually segregated by the OS from each other and the OS itself. However, interaction between processes and/or the OS is still possible via several mechanisms.

In particular, Android provides the use of “**Intents**” as one of the ways for inter-process communication. A broadcast using an “Intent” allows an application or the OS to send a message system-wide which can be listened to by other applications. While functionality exists to restrict who is allowed to read such messages, application developers often neglect to implement these restrictions properly or mask sensitive data. This leads to a common vulnerability within Android applications where a malicious application running on the same device can spy on and capture messages being broadcast by other applications.

Another security mechanism present in the Android is **permissions**. These are safeguards designed to protect the privacy of users. Applications must explicitly request access to certain information or features via a special “**uses-permission**” tag in the application manifest (“**AndroidManifest.xml**”). Depending on the type of permission (“normal”, “dangerous”, etc”) the OS may display the permission information to the user during installation, or may prompt again during run-time. Some permissions can only be used by system applications and cannot be used by regular developers.

Screenshots of application permissions in Google Play and at run-time:

![pic3](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pic3.png?w=169&h=300) ![pic4](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pic4.png?w=169&h=300) ![pic6](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pic6.png?w=169&h=300)

# Vulnerability Details

The Android OS broadcasts the WiFi strength value (RSSI) system-wide on a regular basis. No special permission is needed to access this information. The RSSI values represent the relative strength of the signal being received by the device (higher = stronger) but are not directly correlated to the actual physical signal strength (dBm). This is exposed via two separate intents (“**android.net.wifi.STATE\_CHANGE**” prior to Android 9; and “**android.net.wifi.RSSI\_CHANGED**” in all versions of Android).

While applications can also access this information via the WifiManager, this normall requires the “ACCESS\_WIFI\_STATE” permission in the application manifest. For the WiFi RTT feature that is new to Android 9 and is used for similar geolocation, the “ACCESS\_FINE\_LOCATION” is required. But, when listening for system broadcasts, no such permissions are required allowing applications to capture this information without the knowledge of the user.

There are two separate security issues present:

1. RSSI values are available via broadcasts, bypassing the permission check normally required (“ACCESS\_WIFI\_STATE”).
2. RSSI values, via broadcasts or WifiManager can be used for indoor position without the special location permission.

# Steps to Replicate by Regular Users

For Android device users, you can replicate these issues as follows:

1. Install [the “Internal Broadcasts Monitor” application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=lt.andro.broadcastlogger) developed by Vilius Kraujutis from Google Play.
2. Open the application and tap “Start” to monitor broadcasts.
3. Observe system broadcasts, specifically “android.net.wifi.STATE\_CHANGE” (prior to Android 9) and “android.net.wifi.RSSI\_CHANGED” (all versions).

Screenshot example:

![screen1](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/screen1.png?w=176&h=300)

# Steps to Replicate by Developers via Code

To replicate this in code, create a Broadcast receiver and register it to receive the actions “android.net.wifi.STATE\_CHANGE” (Android version v8.1 and below only) and “android.net.wifi.RSSI\_CHANGED”.

Sample code appears below:

```
public class MainActivity extends Activity {
@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle state) {
    IntentFilter filter = new IntentFilter();
    filter.addAction(android.net.wifi.STATE_CHANGE);
    filter.addAction(android.net.wifi.RSSI_CHANGED);
    registerReceiver(receiver, filter);
}

BroadcastReceiver receiver = new BroadcastReceiver() {
@Override
public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
    Log.d(intent.toString());
    ….
}
};
```
# Testing Methodology

Our test used the following devices:

* Pixel 2, running Android 8.1.0, patch level July 2018
* Nexus 6P, running Android 8.1.0, patch level July 2018
* Moto G4, running Android 7.0, patch level April 2018
* Kindle Fire HD (8 gen), running Fire OS 5.6.10, which is forked from Android 5.1.1, updated April 2018
* Router used was ASUS RT-N56U running the latest firmware

*(We included the Kindle Fire to show that forks of Android inherit this functionality)*

The following steps were performed:

1. Install Broadcast Monitor app.
2. Put the phone into airplane mode.
3. Walk into the room.
4. Turn off airplane mode (to trigger the RSSI broadcasts).
5. Get the RSSI values from the following broadcasts:
   1. android.net.wifi.RSSI\_CHANGE – newRssi value
   2. android.net.wifi.STATE\_CHANGE – networkInfo / RSSI
6. Repeat steps 3-4 for each room.

Results of the testing cleared showed that each room had a unique range of RSSI values when using a particular device.

Range of values collected during testing:

 | **Room #** | **Pixel** | **Nexus** | **Moto G4** | **Kindle Fire** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 39 – 43 | 44 | 39 – 42 | 59 – 60 |
| 2 | 45 – 49 | 49 – 56 | 48 – 52 | 45 – 46 |
| 3 | 42 – 44 | 50 | 51 – 53 | 49 – 50 |
| 4 | 54 – 56 | 60 – 63 | 60 – 62 | 66 |

# Vendor Response and Mitigation

The vendor (Google) classified this issue as **Moderate** and assigned **CVE-2018-9581** to track this issue. ~~No fix is available yet~~ A fix is available on [Android 10 / Q](https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/android-q), however on Android 9 / P one of the two broadcast types (“android.net.wifi.STATE\_CHANGE”) is no longer revealing sensitive data (as part of the fix for CVE-2018-9489). It is unknown if this issue is being exploited in the wild.

# Sensitive Data Exposure via Battery Information Broadcasts in Android OS [CVE-2018-15835]

*[NOTE: This bug is part of a series of three related Android bugs with the same root cause: [CVE-2018-9489](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2018/08/29/sensitive-data-exposure-via-wifi-broadcasts-in-android-os-cve-2018-9489/), [CVE-2018-9581](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2018/11/11/cve-2018-9581/) and [CVE-2018-15835](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2018/11/11/cve-2018-15835/).

# Summary

**System broadcasts by the Android operating system expose detailed information about the battery.** Prior research has demonstrated that the same charging information – when exposed via browser battery status API – can be used to uniquely identify and track users. As the result, the battery API was removed from most browsers.

On Android however, this information is made available with high precision. Furthermore, no special permission is required by any application to access this information. **As the result, this can be used to uniquely identify and track users across multiple apps.** This was verified via limited testing to be possible within a short period of time.

**Android versions 5.0 and later** are affected. The vendor (Google) does not classify this bug as a security issue and has not released any fix plans. **CVE-2018-15835** has been assigned by MITRE to track this issue. Further research is also recommended to see whether this is being exploited in the wild.

# Background

**Android** is an open source operating system developed by **Google** for mobile phones and tablets. It is estimated that over two billion devices exist worldwide running Android. Applications on Android are usually segregated by the OS from each other and the OS itself. However, interaction between processes and/or the OS is still possible via several mechanisms.

In particular, Android provides the use of “**Intents**” as one of the ways for inter-process communication. A broadcast using an “Intent” allows an application or the OS to send a message system-wide which can be listened to by other applications. While functionality exists to restrict who is allowed to read such messages, application developers often neglect to implement these restrictions properly or mask sensitive data. This leads to a common vulnerability within Android applications where a malicious application running on the same device can spy on and capture messages being broadcast by other applications.

Another security mechanism present in the Android is **permissions**. These are safeguards designed to protect the privacy of users. Applications must explicitly request access to certain information or features via a special “**uses-permission**” tag in the application manifest (“**AndroidManifest.xml**”). Depending on the type of permission (“normal”, “dangerous”, etc”) the OS may display the permission information to the user during installation, or may prompt again during run-time. Some permissions can only be used by system applications and cannot be used by regular developers.

Screenshots of application permissions in Google Play and at run-time:

![pic3](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pic3.png?w=169&h=300) ![pic4](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pic4.png?w=169&h=300) ![pic6](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pic6.png?w=169&h=300)

# Vulnerability Details

The Android OS broadcasts information about the battery system-wide on a regular basis including charging level, voltage and temperature. No special permission is needed to access this information. This is exposed via the “**android.intent.action.BATTERY\_CHANGED**” intent and is only available on **Android 5.0 or later**. The same information is also available via Android’s **BatteryManager** without a special permission.

A similar capability existed in browsers via W3C’s Battery Status API. However, extensive research by Łukasz Olejnik et al. showed that this API can be used to fingerprint devices, thus leading to tracking of users. Additional research revealed this being used in the wild by multiple websites, and the API was removed from most web browsers as the result.

In our limited testing we were able to distinguish devices located behind the same NAT device within a short period of time, thus leading to session re-spawning, but we were not yet able to replicate all the prior research regarding the HTML5 battery status API. This testing was based on the uniqueness of the current battery charging counter as being different across defines.

As the result, the same privacy issues that applied in the original Battery Status API should apply for Android applications resulting in applications being able to fingerprint and track users, and re-spawn session across multiple apps on the same device. Further research is needed to see if this is being actively exploited in the wild.

# Steps to Replicate by Regular Users

For Android device users, you can replicate these issues as follows:

1. Install [the “Internal Broadcasts Monitor” application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=lt.andro.broadcastlogger) developed by Vilius Kraujutis from Google Play.
2. Open the application and tap “Start” to monitor broadcasts.
3. Observe system broadcasts, specifically “android.net.wifi.STATE\_CHANGE” and “android.net.wifi.p2p.THIS\_DEVICE\_CHANGED”.

Screenshot example:

![text](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/text.png?w=175&h=300)

# Steps to Replicate by Developers via Code

To replicate this in code, create a Broadcast receiver and register it to receive the action “android.intent.action.BATTERY\_CHANGE”). Sample code appears below:

```
public class MainActivity extends Activity {
@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle state) {
    IntentFilter filter = new IntentFilter();
    filter.addAction(
	android.intent.action.BATTERY_CHANGE);
    registerReceiver(receiver, filter);
}

BroadcastReceiver receiver = new BroadcastReceiver() {
@Override
public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
    Log.d(intent.toString());
    ….
}
};
```
# Vendor Response and Mitigation

The vendor (Google) classified this issue as “NSBC” = “Not Security Bulletin Class” – meaning ““It was rated as not being a security vulnerability that would meet the severity bar for inclusion in an Android security bulletin.” **CVE-2018-15835** was assigned by the vendor for tracking. No fix is yet available.

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```
# nmap -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org

# Sensitive Data Exposure via Battery Information Broadcasts in Android OS [CVE-2018-15835]

---

*From*: Nightwatch Cybersecurity Research <research () nightwatchcybersecurity com>

*Date*: Sun, 11 Nov 2018 20:11:22 -0500

```
[NOTE: This bug is part of a series of three related Android bugs with
the same root cause: CVE-2018-9489, CVE-2018-9581 and CVE-2018-15835.
A presentation covering all three bugs was given at BSides DE in the
fall of 2018.]

SUMMARY

System broadcasts by the Android operating system expose detailed
information about the battery. Prior research has demonstrated that
the same charging information - when exposed via browser battery
status API - can be used to uniquely identify and track users. As the
result, the battery API was removed from most browsers.

On Android however, this information is made available with high
precision. Furthermore, no special permission is required by any
application to access this information. As the result, this can be
used to uniquely identify and track users across multiple apps. This
was verified via limited testing to be possible within a short period
of time.

Android versions 5.0 and later are affected. The vendor (Google) does
not classify this bug as a security issue and has not released any fix
plans. CVE-2018-15835 has been assigned by MITRE to track this issue.
Further research is also recommended to see whether this is being
exploited in the wild.

BACKGROUND

Android is an open source operating system developed by Google for
mobile phones and tablets. It is estimated that over two billion
devices exist worldwide running Android. Applications on Android are
usually segregated by the OS from each other and the OS itself.
However, interaction between processes and/or the OS is still possible
via several mechanisms.

In particular, Android provides the use of “Intents” as one of the
ways for inter-process communication. A broadcast using an “Intent”
allows an application or the OS to send a message system-wide which
can be listened to by other applications. While functionality exists
to restrict who is allowed to read such messages, application
developers often neglect to implement these restrictions properly or
mask sensitive data. This leads to a common vulnerability within
Android applications where a malicious application running on the same
device can spy on and capture messages being broadcast by other
applications.

Another security mechanism present in the Android is permissions.
These are safeguards designed to protect the privacy of users.
Applications must explicitly request access to certain information or
features via a special “uses-permission” tag in the application
manifest (“AndroidManifest.xml”). Depending on the type of permission
(“normal”, “dangerous”, etc”) the OS may display the permission
information to the user during installation, or may prompt again
during run-time. Some permissions can only be used by system
applications and cannot be used by regular developers.

The Android OS broadcasts information about the battery system-wide on
a regular basis including charging level, voltage and temperature. No
special permission is needed to access this information. This is
exposed via the “android.intent.action.BATTERY_CHANGED” intent and is
only available on Android 5.0 or later. The same information is also
available via Android’s BatteryManager without a special permission.

A similar capability existed in browsers via W3C’s Battery Status API.
However, extensive research by Łukasz Olejnik et al. showed that this
API can be used to fingerprint devices, thus leading to tracking of
users. Additional research revealed this being used in the wild by
multiple websites, and the API was removed from most web browsers as
the result.

In our limited testing we were able to distinguish devices located
behind the same NAT device within a short period of time, thus leading
to session re-spawning, but we were not yet able to replicate all the
prior research regarding the HTML5 battery status API. This testing
was based on the uniqueness of the current battery charging counter as
being different across defines.

As the result, the same privacy issues that applied in the original
Battery Status API should apply for Android applications resulting in
applications being able to fingerprint and track users, and re-spawn
session across multiple apps on the same device. Further research is
needed to see if this is being actively exploited in the wild.

STEPS TO REPLICATE (BY USERS):

For Android device users, you can replicate these issues as follows:
1. Install the “Internal Broadcasts Monitor” application developed by
Vilius Kraujutis from Google Play.
2. Open the application and tap “Start” to monitor broadcasts.
3. Observe system broadcasts, specifically
“android.net.wifi.STATE_CHANGE” and
“android.net.wifi.p2p.THIS_DEVICE_CHANGED”.

STEPS TO REPLICATE (VIA CODE):

To replicate this in code, create a Broadcast receiver and register it
to receive the action “android.intent.action.BATTERY_CHANGE”). Sample
code appears below:

public class MainActivity extends Activity {
@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle state) {
    IntentFilter filter = new IntentFilter();
    filter.addAction(
android.intent.action.BATTERY_CHANGE);
    registerReceiver(receiver, filter);
}

BroadcastReceiver receiver = new BroadcastReceiver() {
@Override
public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
    Log.d(intent.toString());
    ….
}
};

VENDOR RESPONSE AND MITIGATION

# Unpatched Android OS Flaw Allows Adversaries to Track User Location

The vulnerability is one of many with the same root cause: Cross-process information leakage.

A flaw in the Android mobile operating system could allow an attacker with physical proximity to a WiFi router to track the location of users within the router’s range.

The issue (CVE-2018-9581) allows information leakage stemming from inter-process communication. While applications on Android are usually segregated by the OS from each other and from the OS itself, there are still mechanisms for sharing information between them when needed. One of those mechanisms is the use of what Android calls “intents.”

An application or the OS itself can send an “intent” message out, which is broadcast system-wide and can be listened to by other applications. Without proper access restrictions and permissions put in place around these intents, it’s possible for malicious applications to intercept information that it shouldn’t have access to.

“While functionality exists to restrict who is allowed to read such messages, application [and OS] developers often neglect to implement these restrictions properly or mask sensitive data,” explained researchers from Nightwatch Cybersecurity System, in [a post](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2018/11/11/cve-2018-9581/) published on Sunday. “This leads to a common vulnerability within Android applications where a malicious application running on the same device can spy on and capture messages being broadcast by other applications.”

In the case of CVE-2018-9581, the Android OS itself is guilty of the oversight, according to Nightwatch. It found that the Android OS broadcasts information about the WiFi connection on a regular basis, using two different intents.

“The WiFi strength value (RSSI) [is broadcast] system-wide on a regular basis,” the team explained. “No special permission is needed to access this information. The RSSI values represent the relative strength of the signal being received by the device (higher = stronger) but are not directly correlated to the actual physical signal strength (dBm).”

Assuming that a phone that’s nearer to a WiFi router would receive a stronger signal, it thus becomes possible to infer a user’s location within a home or office. While on the surface this seems of little concern, given that it is perhaps easier for someone to trace a person’s local movements through visual observation, exploitation of this moderate-rated flaw could be useful for those intending physical harm or plotting a burglary, for example. There’s also a surveillance aspect – an unethical employer could keep logs on where their employees spend their time – to learn if they’re mostly away from their desks, for example, or if they spend too much time in the breakroom.

All versions of Android are believed to be affected (although on Android 9 one of the two broadcast types is no longer revealing sensitive data, as part of the fix for a related bug, CVE-2018-9489). The researchers said they weren’t sure if the flaw has been exploited in the wild. Google has acknowledged the issue, although the patch has not yet been released.

Cross-process information leakage is not new for Android. In fact, this bug is part of a series of three related Android bugs with the same root cause (improperly implemented intent messages). The group also includes CVE-2018-9489 and CVE-2018-15835.

[CVE-2018-9489](https://threatpost.com/android-os-api-breaking-flaw-offers-up-useful-wifi-data-to-bad-actors/137085/), now patched as mentioned, allows adversaries to explore and attack the local WiFi network, or identify and physically track any Android device, by exposing a range of WiFi information.

“This information includes the MAC address of the device, the BSSID and network name of the WiFi access point, and various networking information such as the local IP range, gateway IP and DNS server addresses,” the researchers said. “This information is available to all applications running on the user’s device.”

Armed with the information, adversaries can cause various types of damage, including using the networking information to further explore and attack the local WiFi network. Also, because MAC addresses are hard-coded, they can be used to uniquely identify and track any Android device, even when MAC address randomization is used.

As for [CVE-2018-15835](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2018/11/11/cve-2018-15835/), the intent messages from the Android OS expose detailed information about the battery, which can be used to uniquely identify and track users across applications, with no special permissions. Android versions 5.0 and later are affected by this, but Google said that it doesn’t classify this bug as a security issue and has not released any fix plans.

All of these flaws are also reminiscent of the [man-in-the-disk problem](https://threatpost.com/def-con-2018-man-in-the-disk-attack-surface-affects-all-android-phones/134993/) discussed at DEF CON 2018, which also concerns cross-application information leakage. Android’s OS makes use of two types of storage – internal storage which provides every app with its own sandbox; and an external storage mechanism that uses a removable SD card. This latter storage is shared across the OS, because it’s designed to enable apps to transfer data from one app to another. It means that any data written to it could potentially be snooped out (and the data changed) by another app on the device.

Fortnite for Android for instance was [shown to expose](https://threatpost.com/fortnite-android-app-falls-victim-to-man-in-the-disk-flaw/136931/) user data via the mechanism.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

*[NOTE: This bug is part of a series of three related Android bugs with the same root cause: [CVE-2018-9489](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2018/08/29/sensitive-data-exposure-via-wifi-broadcasts-in-android-os-cve-2018-9489/), [CVE-2018-9581](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2018/11/11/cve-2018-9581/) and [CVE-2018-15835](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2018/11/11/cve-2018-15835/). [A presentation](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2018/11/05/speaking-bsidesde-this-friday-on-android-privacy-bugs-cve-2018-9489-cve-2018-9581-and-cve-2018-15835/) covering all three bugs was given at BSides DE in the fall of 2018.]*

# Summary

**System broadcasts by the Android operating system expose detailed information about the battery.** Prior research has demonstrated that the same charging information – when exposed via browser battery status API – can be used to uniquely identify and track users. As the result, the battery API was removed from most browsers.

On Android however, this information is made available with high precision. Furthermore, no special permission is required by any application to access this information. **As the result, this can be used to uniquely identify and track users across multiple apps.** This was verified via limited testing to be possible within a short period of time.

**Android versions 5.0 and later** are affected. The vendor (Google) does not classify this bug as a security issue and has not released any fix plans. **CVE-2018-15835** has been assigned by MITRE to track this issue. Further research is also recommended to see whether this is being exploited in the wild.

# Background

**Android** is an open source operating system developed by **Google** for mobile phones and tablets. It is estimated that over two billion devices exist worldwide running Android. Applications on Android are usually segregated by the OS from each other and the OS itself. However, interaction between processes and/or the OS is still possible via several mechanisms.

In particular, Android provides the use of “**Intents**” as one of the ways for inter-process communication. A broadcast using an “Intent” allows an application or the OS to send a message system-wide which can be listened to by other applications. While functionality exists to restrict who is allowed to read such messages, application developers often neglect to implement these restrictions properly or mask sensitive data. This leads to a common vulnerability within Android applications where a malicious application running on the same device can spy on and capture messages being broadcast by other applications.

Another security mechanism present in the Android is **permissions**. These are safeguards designed to protect the privacy of users. Applications must explicitly request access to certain information or features via a special “**uses-permission**” tag in the application manifest (“**AndroidManifest.xml**”). Depending on the type of permission (“normal”, “dangerous”, etc”) the OS may display the permission information to the user during installation, or may prompt again during run-time. Some permissions can only be used by system applications and cannot be used by regular developers.

Screenshots of application permissions in Google Play and at run-time:

![pic3](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pic3.png?w=169&h=300) ![pic4](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pic4.png?w=169&h=300) ![pic6](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pic6.png?w=169&h=300)

# Vulnerability Details

The Android OS broadcasts information about the battery system-wide on a regular basis including charging level, voltage and temperature. No special permission is needed to access this information. This is exposed via the “**android.intent.action.BATTERY\_CHANGED**” intent and is only available on **Android 5.0 or later**. The same information is also available via Android’s **BatteryManager** without a special permission.

A similar capability existed in browsers via W3C’s Battery Status API. However, extensive research by Łukasz Olejnik et al. showed that this API can be used to fingerprint devices, thus leading to tracking of users. Additional research revealed this being used in the wild by multiple websites, and the API was removed from most web browsers as the result.

In our limited testing we were able to distinguish devices located behind the same NAT device within a short period of time, thus leading to session re-spawning, but we were not yet able to replicate all the prior research regarding the HTML5 battery status API. This testing was based on the uniqueness of the current battery charging counter as being different across defines.

As the result, the same privacy issues that applied in the original Battery Status API should apply for Android applications resulting in applications being able to fingerprint and track users, and re-spawn session across multiple apps on the same device. Further research is needed to see if this is being actively exploited in the wild.

# Steps to Replicate by Regular Users

For Android device users, you can replicate these issues as follows:

1. Install [the “Internal Broadcasts Monitor” application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=lt.andro.broadcastlogger) developed by Vilius Kraujutis from Google Play.
2. Open the application and tap “Start” to monitor broadcasts.
3. Observe system broadcasts, specifically “android.net.wifi.STATE\_CHANGE” and “android.net.wifi.p2p.THIS\_DEVICE\_CHANGED”.

Screenshot example:

![text](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/text.png?w=175&h=300)

# Steps to Replicate by Developers via Code

To replicate this in code, create a Broadcast receiver and register it to receive the action “android.intent.action.BATTERY\_CHANGE”). Sample code appears below:

```
public class MainActivity extends Activity {
@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle state) {
    IntentFilter filter = new IntentFilter();
    filter.addAction(
	android.intent.action.BATTERY_CHANGE);
    registerReceiver(receiver, filter);
}

BroadcastReceiver receiver = new BroadcastReceiver() {
@Override
public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
    Log.d(intent.toString());
    ….
}
};
```
# Vendor Response and Mitigation

The vendor (Google) classified this issue as “NSBC” = “Not Security Bulletin Class” – meaning ““It was rated as not being a security vulnerability that would meet the severity bar for inclusion in an Android security bulletin.” **CVE-2018-15835** was assigned by the vendor for tracking. No fix is yet available.

# Measure device power

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

You can determine device power consumption for Android devices that include a battery fuel gauge
such as a Summit SMB347 or Maxim MAX17050 (available on many Nexus devices). Use the in-system
gauge when external measurement equipment is not available or is inconvenient to
connect to a device (such as in mobile usage).

Measurements can include instantaneous current, remaining charge, battery capacity at test start
and end, and more depending on the supported properties of the device (see below). For best
results, perform device power measurements during long-running A/B tests that use the same device
type with the same fuel gauge and same current sense resistor. Ensure the starting battery charge
is the same for each device to avoid differing fuel gauge behavior at different points in the
battery discharge curve.

Even with identical test environments, measurements are not guaranteed to be of high absolute
accuracy. However, most inaccuracies specific to the fuel gauge and sense resistor are consistent
between test runs, making comparisons between identical devices useful. We recommend running
multiple tests in different configurations to identify significant differences and relative power
consumption between configurations.

## Read power consumption

To read power consumption data, insert calls to the API in your testing code.

```
import android.os.BatteryManager;
import android.content.Context;
BatteryManager mBatteryManager =
(BatteryManager)Context.getSystemService(Context.BATTERY_SERVICE);
Long energy =
mBatteryManager.getLongProperty(BatteryManager.BATTERY_PROPERTY_ENERGY_COUNTER);
Slog.i(TAG, "Remaining energy = " + energy + "nWh");
```
## Available properties

Android supports the following battery fuel gauge properties:

```

BATTERY_PROPERTY_CHARGE_COUNTER   Remaining battery capacity in microampere-hours
BATTERY_PROPERTY_CURRENT_NOW      Instantaneous battery current in microamperes
BATTERY_PROPERTY_CURRENT_AVERAGE  Average battery current in microamperes
BATTERY_PROPERTY_CAPACITY         Remaining battery capacity as an integer percentage
BATTERY_PROPERTY_ENERGY_COUNTER   Remaining energy in nanowatt-hours

```

Most properties are read from kernel power\_supply subsystem attributes of similar names.
However, the exact properties, resolution of property values, and update frequency
available for a specific device depend on:

* Fuel gauge hardware, such as a Summit SMB347 or Maxim MAX17050.
* Fuel gauge-to-system connection, such as the value of external current sense resistors.
* Fuel gauge chip software configuration, such as values chosen for average current computation
  intervals in the kernel driver.

For details, see the properties available for [Nexus devices](#nexus-devices).

## Maxim fuel gauge

When determining battery state-of-charge over a long period of time, the Maxim fuel gauge
(MAX17050, BC15) corrects for coulomb-counter offset measurements. For measurements made over a
short period of time (such as power consumption metering tests), the fuel gauge doesn't make
corrections, making the offset the primary source of error when current measurements are too small
(although no amount of time can eliminate the offset error completely).

For a typical 10 mOhm sense resistor design, the offset current should be better than
1.5 mA, meaning any measurement is +/-1.5 mA (PCBoard layout can also affect this
variation). For example, when measuring a large current (200 mA) you can expect the
following:

* 2 mA (1% gain error of 200 mA due to fuel gauge gain error)
* +2 mA (1% gain error of 200 mA due to sense resistor error)
* +1.5 mA (current sense offset error from fuel gauge)

The total error is 5.5 mA (2.75%). Compare this to a medium current (50 mA) where the
same error percentages give a total error of 7% or to a small current (15 mA) where
+/-1.5 mA gives a total error of 10%.

For best results, we recommend measuring greater than 20 mA. Gain measurement errors are
systematic and repeatable, enabling you to test a device in multiple modes and get clean relative
measurements (with exceptions for the 1.5 mA offset).

For +/-100 uA relative measurements, required measurement time depends on:

* **ADC sampling noise**. The MAX17050 with its normal factory configuration produces
  +/-1.5 mA sample-to-sample variation due to noise, with each sample delivered at 175.8 ms.
  You can expect a rough +/-100 uA for a 1 minute test window and a clean 3-sigma noise less
  than 100 uA (or 1-sigma noise at 33 uA) for a 6 minute test window.
* **Sample aliasing because of load variation**. Variation exaggerates errors, so for samples
  with variation inherent in the loading, consider using a longer test window.

*[NOTE: This bug is part of a series of three related Android bugs with the same root cause: [CVE-2018-9489](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2018/08/29/sensitive-data-exposure-via-wifi-broadcasts-in-android-os-cve-2018-9489/), [CVE-2018-9581](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2018/11/11/cve-2018-9581/) and [CVE-2018-15835](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2018/11/11/cve-2018-15835/).

# Summary

**System broadcasts by the Android operating system expose detailed information about the battery.** Prior research has demonstrated that the same charging information – when exposed via browser battery status API – can be used to uniquely identify and track users. As the result, the battery API was removed from most browsers.

On Android however, this information is made available with high precision. Furthermore, no special permission is required by any application to access this information. **As the result, this can be used to uniquely identify and track users across multiple apps.** This was verified via limited testing to be possible within a short period of time.

**Android versions 5.0 and later** are affected. The vendor (Google) does not classify this bug as a security issue and has not released any fix plans. **CVE-2018-15835** has been assigned by MITRE to track this issue. Further research is also recommended to see whether this is being exploited in the wild.

# Background

**Android** is an open source operating system developed by **Google** for mobile phones and tablets. It is estimated that over two billion devices exist worldwide running Android. Applications on Android are usually segregated by the OS from each other and the OS itself. However, interaction between processes and/or the OS is still possible via several mechanisms.

In particular, Android provides the use of “**Intents**” as one of the ways for inter-process communication. A broadcast using an “Intent” allows an application or the OS to send a message system-wide which can be listened to by other applications. While functionality exists to restrict who is allowed to read such messages, application developers often neglect to implement these restrictions properly or mask sensitive data. This leads to a common vulnerability within Android applications where a malicious application running on the same device can spy on and capture messages being broadcast by other applications.

Another security mechanism present in the Android is **permissions**. These are safeguards designed to protect the privacy of users. Applications must explicitly request access to certain information or features via a special “**uses-permission**” tag in the application manifest (“**AndroidManifest.xml**”). Depending on the type of permission (“normal”, “dangerous”, etc”) the OS may display the permission information to the user during installation, or may prompt again during run-time. Some permissions can only be used by system applications and cannot be used by regular developers.

Screenshots of application permissions in Google Play and at run-time:

![pic3](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pic3.png?w=169&h=300) ![pic4](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pic4.png?w=169&h=300) ![pic6](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pic6.png?w=169&h=300)

# Vulnerability Details

The Android OS broadcasts information about the battery system-wide on a regular basis including charging level, voltage and temperature. No special permission is needed to access this information. This is exposed via the “**android.intent.action.BATTERY\_CHANGED**” intent and is only available on **Android 5.0 or later**. The same information is also available via Android’s **BatteryManager** without a special permission.

A similar capability existed in browsers via W3C’s Battery Status API. However, extensive research by Łukasz Olejnik et al. showed that this API can be used to fingerprint devices, thus leading to tracking of users. Additional research revealed this being used in the wild by multiple websites, and the API was removed from most web browsers as the result.

In our limited testing we were able to distinguish devices located behind the same NAT device within a short period of time, thus leading to session re-spawning, but we were not yet able to replicate all the prior research regarding the HTML5 battery status API. This testing was based on the uniqueness of the current battery charging counter as being different across defines.

As the result, the same privacy issues that applied in the original Battery Status API should apply for Android applications resulting in applications being able to fingerprint and track users, and re-spawn session across multiple apps on the same device. Further research is needed to see if this is being actively exploited in the wild.

# Steps to Replicate by Regular Users

For Android device users, you can replicate these issues as follows:

1. Install [the “Internal Broadcasts Monitor” application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=lt.andro.broadcastlogger) developed by Vilius Kraujutis from Google Play.
2. Open the application and tap “Start” to monitor broadcasts.
3. Observe system broadcasts, specifically “android.net.wifi.STATE\_CHANGE” and “android.net.wifi.p2p.THIS\_DEVICE\_CHANGED”.

Screenshot example:

![text](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/text.png?w=175&h=300)

# Steps to Replicate by Developers via Code

To replicate this in code, create a Broadcast receiver and register it to receive the action “android.intent.action.BATTERY\_CHANGE”). Sample code appears below:

```
public class MainActivity extends Activity {
@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle state) {
    IntentFilter filter = new IntentFilter();
    filter.addAction(
	android.intent.action.BATTERY_CHANGE);
    registerReceiver(receiver, filter);
}

BroadcastReceiver receiver = new BroadcastReceiver() {
@Override
public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
    Log.d(intent.toString());
    ….
}
};
```
# Vendor Response and Mitigation

The vendor (Google) classified this issue as “NSBC” = “Not Security Bulletin Class” – meaning ““It was rated as not being a security vulnerability that would meet the severity bar for inclusion in an Android security bulletin.” **CVE-2018-15835** was assigned by the vendor for tracking. No fix is yet available.

# Sensitive Data Exposure via Battery Information Broadcasts in Android OS [CVE-2018-15835]

*[NOTE: This bug is part of a series of three related Android bugs with the same root cause: [CVE-2018-9489](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2018/08/29/sensitive-data-exposure-via-wifi-broadcasts-in-android-os-cve-2018-9489/), [CVE-2018-9581](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2018/11/11/cve-2018-9581/) and [CVE-2018-15835](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2018/11/11/cve-2018-15835/). [A presentation](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2018/11/05/speaking-bsidesde-this-friday-on-android-privacy-bugs-cve-2018-9489-cve-2018-9581-and-cve-2018-15835/) covering all three bugs was given at BSides DE in the fall of 2018.]*

# Summary

**System broadcasts by the Android operating system expose detailed information about the battery.** Prior research has demonstrated that the same charging information – when exposed via browser battery status API – can be used to uniquely identify and track users. As the result, the battery API was removed from most browsers.

On Android however, this information is made available with high precision. Furthermore, no special permission is required by any application to access this information. **As the result, this can be used to uniquely identify and track users across multiple apps.** This was verified via limited testing to be possible within a short period of time.

**Android versions 5.0 and later** are affected. The vendor (Google) does not classify this bug as a security issue and has not released any fix plans. **CVE-2018-15835** has been assigned by MITRE to track this issue. Further research is also recommended to see whether this is being exploited in the wild.

# Background

**Android** is an open source operating system developed by **Google** for mobile phones and tablets. It is estimated that over two billion devices exist worldwide running Android. Applications on Android are usually segregated by the OS from each other and the OS itself. However, interaction between processes and/or the OS is still possible via several mechanisms.

In particular, Android provides the use of “**Intents**” as one of the ways for inter-process communication. A broadcast using an “Intent” allows an application or the OS to send a message system-wide which can be listened to by other applications. While functionality exists to restrict who is allowed to read such messages, application developers often neglect to implement these restrictions properly or mask sensitive data. This leads to a common vulnerability within Android applications where a malicious application running on the same device can spy on and capture messages being broadcast by other applications.

Another security mechanism present in the Android is **permissions**. These are safeguards designed to protect the privacy of users. Applications must explicitly request access to certain information or features via a special “**uses-permission**” tag in the application manifest (“**AndroidManifest.xml**”). Depending on the type of permission (“normal”, “dangerous”, etc”) the OS may display the permission information to the user during installation, or may prompt again during run-time. Some permissions can only be used by system applications and cannot be used by regular developers.

Screenshots of application permissions in Google Play and at run-time:

![pic3](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pic3.png?w=169&h=300) ![pic4](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pic4.png?w=169&h=300) ![pic6](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pic6.png?w=169&h=300)

# Vulnerability Details

The Android OS broadcasts information about the battery system-wide on a regular basis including charging level, voltage and temperature. No special permission is needed to access this information. This is exposed via the “**android.intent.action.BATTERY\_CHANGED**” intent and is only available on **Android 5.0 or later**. The same information is also available via Android’s **BatteryManager** without a special permission.

A similar capability existed in browsers via W3C’s Battery Status API. However, extensive research by Łukasz Olejnik et al. showed that this API can be used to fingerprint devices, thus leading to tracking of users. Additional research revealed this being used in the wild by multiple websites, and the API was removed from most web browsers as the result.

In our limited testing we were able to distinguish devices located behind the same NAT device within a short period of time, thus leading to session re-spawning, but we were not yet able to replicate all the prior research regarding the HTML5 battery status API. This testing was based on the uniqueness of the current battery charging counter as being different across defines.

As the result, the same privacy issues that applied in the original Battery Status API should apply for Android applications resulting in applications being able to fingerprint and track users, and re-spawn session across multiple apps on the same device. Further research is needed to see if this is being actively exploited in the wild.

# Steps to Replicate by Regular Users

For Android device users, you can replicate these issues as follows:

1. Install [the “Internal Broadcasts Monitor” application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=lt.andro.broadcastlogger) developed by Vilius Kraujutis from Google Play.
2. Open the application and tap “Start” to monitor broadcasts.
3. Observe system broadcasts, specifically “android.net.wifi.STATE\_CHANGE” and “android.net.wifi.p2p.THIS\_DEVICE\_CHANGED”.

Screenshot example:

![text](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/text.png?w=175&h=300)

# Steps to Replicate by Developers via Code

To replicate this in code, create a Broadcast receiver and register it to receive the action “android.intent.action.BATTERY\_CHANGE”). Sample code appears below:

```
public class MainActivity extends Activity {
@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle state) {
    IntentFilter filter = new IntentFilter();
    filter.addAction(
	android.intent.action.BATTERY_CHANGE);
    registerReceiver(receiver, filter);
}

BroadcastReceiver receiver = new BroadcastReceiver() {
@Override
public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
    Log.d(intent.toString());
    ….
}
};
```
# Vendor Response and Mitigation

The vendor (Google) classified this issue as “NSBC” = “Not Security Bulletin Class” – meaning ““It was rated as not being a security vulnerability that would meet the severity bar for inclusion in an Android security bulletin.” **CVE-2018-15835** was assigned by the vendor for tracking. No fix is yet available.
