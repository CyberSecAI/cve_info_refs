      "No special permissions are required to access this information.",
      "Exposed via the `android.intent.action.BATTERY_CHANGED` intent.",
	  "The same information is also available via Android's BatteryManager without a special permission."
    ],
    "impact": "Applications can use the battery data to uniquely identify and track users across multiple apps, potentially leading to session re-spawning.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "A malicious application installed on the device can listen to system broadcasts and capture battery information.",
	  "The same information is available via the BatteryManager, also without requiring permissions."
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the target Android device. No special permissions are needed.",
