Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2018-15596:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the lack of sanitization of thread titles when generating RSS feeds using the Atom 1.0 format.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The thread titles in the generated RSS feeds are not sanitized, allowing for the injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious code into the thread title, which will then be executed when a user clicks on the thread link in the RSS feed. This could lead to various attacks, such as redirection to malicious websites (as demonstrated in the proof of concept), session hijacking, or other client-side attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker must create or find a thread and modify the thread title to contain a malicious payload.
- The attacker uses the RSS syndication feature to generate a URL for the forum feed.
- The victim visits the RSS feed URL, and clicks on the manipulated thread title link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to create or modify thread titles on the target MyBB forum.
- The attacker needs to know how to generate an RSS feed URL of the forum.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided exploit description includes a proof-of-concept, which involves using `<a href="//google.com">Cool Thread Title</a>` as the thread title. Clicking on this link in the RSS feed redirects the user to Google.com, demonstrating the XSS vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is specifically present in the Atom 1.0 RSS feed generation within MyBB version 1.8.17
- MyBB version 1.8.18 addresses this vulnerability, as indicated in the blog post: "Medium risk: RSS Atom 1.0 item title persistent XSS â€” reported by 0xB9".
