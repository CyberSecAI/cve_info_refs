**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**

  - The vulnerability is a **reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** issue.
  - The vulnerability lies in the way ManageEngine Applications Manager handles user-supplied input within the `method` parameter of the `/deleteMO.do` endpoint. Specifically, it does not properly sanitize the input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious script.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

  - **Reflected XSS:** The application reflects the unsanitized input back to the user, allowing the injected script to be executed in the user's browser.
  - **Lack of Input Sanitization:**  The application fails to sanitize or encode user-provided data within the `method` parameter before displaying it in the response.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**

   - Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
        - **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could execute malicious scripts within the context of the user's browser session.
        - **Session Hijacking:** Attackers could steal session cookies to impersonate legitimate users.
        - **Information Theft:** Sensitive information could be stolen or manipulated.
        - **Website Defacement:** The application's visual content can be modified.
        - **Redirection to malicious sites:** Users can be redirected to malicious websites

**5. Attack vectors:**

  - The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code within the `method` parameter.
  - An attacker would need to trick a user into clicking on the malicious URL, typically through social engineering or by embedding the URL on a compromised website.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

   - The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
   - The attacker needs to lure a victim into clicking a malicious link.
