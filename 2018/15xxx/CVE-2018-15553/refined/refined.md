{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The web interface allows execution of commands via the Samba username and password fields.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Command injection vulnerability in the Samba configuration fields of the web interface.",
    "Default or easily reset password allows access to the web interface.",
    "Writable filesystem partitions (/dev/mtdblock0 and /dev/mtdblock1) after mounting.",
    "Insecure handling of permissions files (/webs/perm.txt and /webs/perm2.txt) allows privilege escalation"
   ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Full root shell access, allowing complete control over the modem. Ability to modify firmware, disable updates, and change critical settings.",
  "Attack vectors": [
     "Web interface accessible on the local network.",
     "Samba configuration fields in the web interface."
   ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
     "Access to the web interface, either through default credentials, or reset credentials using the device serial number. The attacker needs to be on the local network.",
     "Ability to send HTTP requests to the web interface."
  ]
