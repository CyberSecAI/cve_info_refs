Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-15953:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an **out-of-bounds read** error.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The identified vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read. This means that the software attempts to read data from a memory location outside of the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to **information disclosure**. An attacker could potentially read sensitive information from the application's memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves processing a maliciously crafted file using Adobe Acrobat or Reader. Specifically, the vulnerability was found in the JP2K image parsing library (JP2KLib.dll). The attacker would need to entice a user to open a specially crafted file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to create a malicious file (e.g., a JP2 file embedded in a PDF) that triggers the out-of-bounds read during processing by Adobe Acrobat/Reader.

**Additional Details from Checkpoint Research:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered using a fuzzer tool (WinAFL) that helps to identify potential weaknesses in software.
*   A specific harness program was developed to target and test the JPEG2000 image parsing functionality in `JP2KLib.dll`. This harness allowed researchers to isolate and focus the fuzzing efforts on this specific vulnerable component.
*   The research involved reverse engineering of the Adobe Readerâ€™s `JP2KLib.dll` to understand the workings of the target functions.
*   The fuzzing process involved: creating a harness, creating a corpus of test files, running the fuzzer, checking for crashes and coverage, minimizing the corpus and triaging the crashes.

This vulnerability is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities discovered through this research, all relating to parsing of different file formats handled by Adobe Reader.
