Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-15398:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from errors in how Cisco ASA and FTD software construct and apply per-user-override rules.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper handling of per-user-override rules.
- Failure to properly enforce access control lists (ACLs) when per-user-override is enabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can bypass interface ACLs.
- Successful exploitation allows access to resources that should be protected by the firewall.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to connect to a network through an affected device.
- The vulnerable device must have the following configurations:
    - At least one interface ACL with `per-user-override` enabled.
    - At least one VPN connection profile (remote access or site-to-site) associated with a group policy that specifies a filter ACL.
    - A VPN tunnel associated with the affected profile must be up.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to establish a network connection through the vulnerable device.
- No authentication is required.

**Additional Notes:**

- The `per-user-override` feature in Cisco FTD software is configurable via FlexConfig only.
- There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability (refer to the Cisco bug ID: CSCvj91858).
- The CVSS base score for this vulnerability is 5.8 (Medium).
- The CWE is CWE-284: Improper Access Control.
