  "CVE-2018-15932": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Out-of-bounds read",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read. The specific location and context are not provided, but the vulnerability lies in the processing of data that leads to accessing memory outside the allocated buffer.",
     "Impact of exploitation": "Information Disclosure. An attacker could potentially read sensitive information from the process memory.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted file or data stream. The exact method of triggering this out-of-bounds read is not described here, but it occurs within the vulnerable code when reading data.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious input to the vulnerable application. This could be achieved through a maliciously crafted document or by exploiting a remote service that uses the vulnerable component. The attacker must have the ability to control the input stream being processed by the application."
