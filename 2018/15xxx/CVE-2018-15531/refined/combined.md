SECURITY-1101
A URL used to allow setting the description of a test object in JUnit
Plugin did not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request
forgery vulnerability.

SECURITY-1029
Jira Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form
validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to
connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials
IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

SECURITY-1080
Config File Provider Plugin did not escape configuration file metadata,
resulting in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

SECURITY-938
A URL used to save configuration files based on form submissions in Config
File Provider Plugin did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF
vulnerability.

SECURITY-130
Rebuild Plugin did not escape parameter descriptions shown on the rebuild
form page, resulting in a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by users with the permission to configure jobs.

SECURITY-1130
Job Config History Plugin did not escape some query parameters shown on its
pages, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

SECURITY-1125
Some URLs implementing form submission handling in Email Extension Template
Plugin did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability
that allowed attackers to create or remove templates.

SECURITY-984 (1)
HipChat Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method that sends
test notifications. This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins
to connect to an attacker-specified HipChat server using attacker-specified
connection settings and credentials IDs obtained through another method,
capturing credentials stored in Jenkins, and submitting messages to HipChat.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

SECURITY-984 (2)
HipChat Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow
administrators configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality did not check permissions, allowing any user with
Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those could
be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another
vulnerability.

SECURITY-1013 (1)
Mesos Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow
administrators configuring the Mesos cloud to select the one to use.

This functionality did not check permissions, allowing any user with
Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those could
be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another
vulnerability.

SECURITY-1013 (2)
A missing permission check in a form validation method in Mesos Plugin
allowed users with Overall/Read permission to initiate a connection test,
connecting to an attacker-specified URL.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests,
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

SECURITY-1067
Crowd 2 Integration Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method
implementing form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read access
to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL with attacker-specified
credentials and connection settings.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests,
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

SECURITY-1068
Crowd 2 Integration Plugin stored the Crowd password unencrypted in its
global configuration file on the Jenkins master. This password could be
viewed by users with access to the master file system.

SECURITY-972
Users with Overall/Read permission were able to access MQ Notifier Plugin’s
form validation URL, having it connect to an attacker-specified MQ system
with attacker-specified credentials.

Additionally, this form validation URL did not require POST requests,
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

SECURITY-1075
A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Metadata Plugin allows
users with permission to change metadata definitions to insert arbitrary
HTML/Javascript into Jenkins pages.

SECURITY-1135
Metadata Plugin lacks a permission check that allows users with
Overall/Read access to Jenkins to change the plugin’s configuration.

SECURITY-265
Artifactory Plugin 2.4.0 introduced support for securely storing
credentials using the Credentials Plugin. Old, insecurely stored
credentials however were not removed when switching to this new system.

SECURITY-813 / CVE-2017-12197
The pam4j library bundled in PAM Authentication Plugin had a bug that
resulted in it not properly validating user accounts.

SECURITY-1163
SonarQube Scanner Plugin stored a server authentication token unencrypted
in its global configuration file on the Jenkins master. This token could be
viewed by users with access to the master file system.

SECURITY-1122
Git Changelog Plugin did not escape the Git commit messages it displayed
since version 1.48, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS)
vulnerability exploitable by users with commit access to specific Git
repositories.

SECURITY-948
Arachni Scanner Plugin stored its password unencrypted in its global
configuration file on the Jenkins master. This password could be viewed by
users with access to the master file system.

SECURITY-1011 (1)
Argus Notifier Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method
implementing form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read access
to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified
credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials
stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

SECURITY-1011 (2)
Argus Notifier Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow
administrators configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality did not check permissions, allowing any user with
Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those could
be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another
vulnerability.

SECURITY-1050 (1)
Chatter Notifier Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method
implementing form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read access
to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified
credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials
stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

SECURITY-1050 (2)
Chatter Notifier Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to
allow users configuring the plugin’s functionality to select the one to use.

This functionality did not check permissions, allowing any user with
Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those could
be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another
vulnerability.

SECURITY-1065
Dimensions Plugin stored a password unencrypted in its global configuration
file on the Jenkins master. This password could be viewed by users with
access to the master file system.

SECURITY-1108
Users with Overall/Read permission were able to access Dimensions Plugin’s
form validation URL, having it connect to an attacker-specified Dimensions
system with attacker-specified credentials.

Additionally, this form validation URL did not require POST requests,
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

SECURITY-845
Publish Over Dropbox Plugin stored authorization code and access code
unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins master. These
secrets could be viewed by users with access to the master file system.

Additionally, the authorization code was not masked from view using a
password form field.

SECURITY-1156 / CVE-2018-15531
The JavaMelody library bundled in Monitoring Plugin is affected by an XML
External Entity (XXE) processing vulnerability.

This allows attacker to send crafted requests to a web application for
extraction of secrets from the file system, server-side request forgery, or
denial-of-service attacks.

Monitoring plugin 1.74 updates its JavaMelody dependency to fix the issue.

The Jenkins security team and the maintainer of Monitoring Plugin have been
unable to reproduce the issue in Jenkins, but we still recommend updating.

## [Hiding a comment](#hiding-a-comment)

Organization moderators, and anyone with write access to a repository, can hide comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

If a comment is off-topic, outdated, or resolved, you may want to hide a comment to keep a discussion focused or make a pull request easier to navigate and review. Hidden comments are minimized but people with read access to the repository can expand them.

![Screenshot of a hidden comment. The only visible content is "This comment has been minimized", with a button to show the comment.](/assets/cb-13766/images/help/repository/hidden-comment.png)

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to hide.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Hide**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Hide" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42438/images/help/repository/comment-menu-hide.png)
3. Using the "Choose a reason" dropdown menu, choose a reason to hide the comment. Then select **Hide comment**.

   ![Screenshot of a comment showing a menu to select a reason to hide the comment: Spam, Abuse, Off Topic, Outdated, Duplicate, or Resolved.](/assets/cb-67538/images/help/repository/choose-reason-for-hiding-comment.png)

## [Unhiding a comment](#unhiding-a-comment)

Organization moderators, and anyone with write access to a repository, can unhide comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to unhide.
2. On the right side of the comment, click  **Show comment**.
3. On the right side of the expanded comment, select the  dropdown menu, then click **Unhide**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment marked as spam. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Unhide" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-50118/images/help/repository/comment-menu-hidden.png)

## [Editing a comment](#editing-a-comment)

Anyone with write access to a repository can edit comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

It's appropriate to edit a comment and remove content that doesn't contribute to the conversation and violates your community's code of conduct or GitHub's [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

Sometimes it may make sense to clearly indicate edits and their justification.

That said, anyone with read access to a repository can view a comment's edit history. The **edited** dropdown at the top of the comment contains a history of edits showing the user and timestamp for each edit.

![Screenshot of a comment by octo-user, which is partially redacted. In the header, next to "edited by octocat", a dropdown icon is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42069/images/help/repository/content-redacted-comment.png)

## [Redacting sensitive information](#redacting-sensitive-information)

Comment authors and anyone with write access to a repository can also delete sensitive information from a comment's edit history. For more information, see [Tracking changes in a comment](/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/tracking-changes-in-a-comment).

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to edit.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Edit**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Edit" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42473/images/help/repository/comment-menu-edit.png)
3. In the comment window, delete the content you'd like to remove, then type `[REDACTED]` to replace it.
4. At the bottom of the comment, type a note indicating that you have edited the comment, and optionally, why you edited the comment.
5. Click **Update comment**.

## [Deleting a comment](#deleting-a-comment)

Anyone with write access to a repository can delete comments on issues, pull requests, and commits. Organization owners, team maintainers, and the comment author can also delete a comment on a team page.

If a comment contains some constructive content that adds to the conversation in the issue or pull request, you can edit the comment instead.

Deleting a comment is your last resort as a moderator. It's appropriate to delete a comment if the entire comment adds no constructive content to a conversation and violates your community's code of conduct or GitHub's [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

Deleting a comment creates a timeline event that is visible to anyone with read access to the repository. However, the username of the person who deleted the comment is only visible to people with write access to the repository. For anyone without write access, the timeline event is anonymized.

![Screenshot of a timeline event, which says "octo-org deleted a comment from hubot 6 minutes ago."](/assets/cb-10760/images/help/issues/anonymized-timeline-entry-for-deleted-comment.png)

Note

The initial comment (or body) of an issue or pull request can't be deleted. Instead, you can edit issue and pull request bodies to remove unwanted content.

### [Steps to delete a comment](#steps-to-delete-a-comment)

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to delete.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Delete**.
   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Delete" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42453/images/help/repository/comment-menu-delete.png)
3. Optionally, write a comment noting that you deleted a comment and why.

### Unprivileged users with Overall/Read access are able to enumerate credential IDs in Chatter Notifier Plugin

**SECURITY-1050 (2)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`chatter-notifier`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/chatter-notifier)**

**Description:**

Chatter Notifier Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow users configuring the plugin’s functionality to select the one to use.

This functionality did not check permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs.
Those could be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

An enumeration of credentials IDs in this plugin now requires Item/Configure permission for the job being configured.

### Dimensions Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-1065**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`dimensionsscm`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/dimensionsscm)**

**Description:**

Dimensions Plugin stored a password unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller.
This password could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

The plugin now stores the password encrypted in the configuration files on disk and no longer transfers it to users viewing the configuration form in plain text.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Dimensions Plugin

**SECURITY-1108**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`dimensionsscm`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/dimensionsscm)**

**Description:**

Users with Overall/Read permission were able to access Dimensions Plugin’s form validation URL, having it connect to an attacker-specified Dimensions system with attacker-specified credentials.

Additionally, this form validation URL did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

The form validation now performs a permission check and requires POST requests to be sent.

### Publish Over Dropbox Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-845**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`publish-over-dropbox`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/publish-over-dropbox)**

**Description:**

Publish Over Dropbox Plugin stored authorization code and access code unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller.
These secrets could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

Additionally, the authorization code was not masked from view using a password form field.

The plugin now stores these secrets encrypted in the configuration files on disk and no longer transfers the authorization code to users viewing the configuration form in plain text.

### XML External Entity Processing Vulnerability in Monitoring Plugin

**SECURITY-1156
/
CVE-2018-15531**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[high](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`monitoring`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/monitoring)**

**Description:**

The JavaMelody library bundled in Monitoring Plugin is affected by an XML External Entity (XXE) processing vulnerability.

This allows attacker to send crafted requests to a web application for extraction of secrets from the file system, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.

Monitoring plugin 1.74 updates its JavaMelody dependency to fix the issue.

The Jenkins security team and the maintainer of Monitoring Plugin have been unable to reproduce the issue in Jenkins, but we still recommend updating.

# ReleaseNotes

[Jump to bottom](#wiki-pages-box)

evernat edited this page Jan 20, 2025
·
[710 revisions](/javamelody/javamelody/wiki/ReleaseNotes/_history)

Releases are available [in github releases](../releases) or [in Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:net.bull.javamelody).

### Next release (2.x)

* fix IllegalStateException when displaying a report which sometimes contains a current http request not current anymore ([77a79bf](../commit/77a79bf))

### 2.4.0

* Fix [#1237](../issues/1237) NPE in the [optional collector server](UserGuideAdvanced#optional-centralization-server-setup) 2.3.0, when monitoring the current requests of an application using javamelody-core before 2.3.0
* Remove the kill threads buttons in Java 20 or later because killing threads is impossible since Java 20 ([JENKINS-73980](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-73980))
* In the [Jenkins plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/monitoring), fix [JENKINS-73868](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-73868), links in the monitoring node page

### 1.99.2

* Fix [#1237](../issues/1237) in the [optional collector server](UserGuideAdvanced#optional-centralization-server-setup) 1.99.1, when monitoring the current requests of an application using javamelody-core before 1.99.1
* In [Jira/Confluence/Bamboo/Bitbucket monitoring plugin](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/wiki/AtlassianPlugin) :
  + use Atlassian platform 7 annotations instead of custom access checks to monitoring page for system admin. These common annotations are great to check the user's role in a plugin.
  + fix compatibility with Jira 10
  + since this release, the plugin now requires the following minimum versions :
    - Jira 10
    - Confluence 9
    - Bamboo 10
    - Bitbucket 9
    - Crowd 6
    - for previous versions, use the monitoring plugin 1.99.1
  + to install the plugin in Confluence, the file of the plugin should be copied to the `atlassian-confluence-x.x.x/confluence/WEB-INF/lib` directory like P1 plugins, because the upload button has been [removed](https://community.developer.atlassian.com/t/changes-to-the-installation-of-dc-apps/77429) from the plugin manager (UPM)
  + to better aggregate http requests in the statistics for those Jira/Confluence/Bamboo versions, the default `javamelody.http-transform-pattern` parameter is changed to `-\d+|/\d+ |/\d+/|(?<=/s/).+|(?<=/attachment/).+|(?<=/component/).+|(?<=/attachments/).+|(?<=/label/).+|(?<=/x/).+|(?<=/test/).+|(?<=/artifact/).+` using lookbehind in regular expression
  + In Bitbucket, authentication for system admin is now required to open the monitoring page (without configuring the `javamelody.authorized-users` parameter), like in Jira/Confluence/Bamboo
  + done by [42d7861](https://github.com/javamelody/jira-confluence-javamelody/commit/42d786165f31ec87e1de76e2dbfafc280bd6951c)

### 2.3.0

* upgrade the [optional collector server](UserGuideAdvanced#optional-centralization-server-setup) to winstone 8.2 (jetty 12) and to javamelody-core 2.x ([e7e5a5b](../commit/e7e5a5b)).
* fix [#1152](../issues/1152) in the [optional collector server](UserGuideAdvanced#optional-centralization-server-setup), bad count of hits in the aggregation from two monitored apps.
* fix in the [optional collector server](UserGuideAdvanced#optional-centralization-server-setup) again, actions (run garbage collector, invalidate http sessions, ...) in the aggregation from two monitored apps throws exception. ([99e3030](../commit/99e3030))
* upgrade the [Jenkins plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/monitoring) to Jenkins 2.479.1 (jakarta.servlet) and to javamelody-core 2.x ([48ce0ba](https://github.com/jenkinsci/monitoring-plugin/commit/48ce0ba)). Before Jenkins 2.479.1, use the Jenkins plugin 1.x.
* compatibility of the [Alfresco plugin](AlfrescoPlugin) with Alfresco 23 or later ([0305b9f](https://github.com/javamelody/alfresco-javamelody/commit/0305b9f)). Before Alfresco 23, use the Alfresco plugin 1.x.
* fix [#1227](../issues/1227) display of virtual thread name and stack trace in the current requests (when using Java 21 and virtual threads)

### 1.99.1

### 2.0.0

* Version 2.0.0 is a major release with breaking changes.
* [#1146](../issues/1146) Migrate javamelody-core to Jakarta EE such as Tomcat 10. If you use Java EE such as Tomcat 9, then use instead the latest javamelody-core 1.x which is still maintained.
* [#1143](../issues/1143) Migrate javamelody-spring-boot-starter to Spring Boot 3. If you use Spring Boot 2, then use instead the latest javamelody-spring-boot-starter 1.x which is still maintained.
* Only javamelody-core and javamelody-spring-boot-starter are released as 2.x at the moment and not the javamelody collector server or the javamelody plugins for Jenkins, JIRA/Confluence/Bamboo/Bitbucket, Sonar, Alfresco, Liferay, Grails because those still use Java EE.
* If you use the optional javamelody collector server which is not needed in most use cases, then use the latest javamelody-collector-server 1.x release, since there is no javamelody-collector-server 2.x released at the moment. It is still compatible with javamelody-core 2.x and with javamelody-spring-boot-starter 2.x.
* Drop support of ehcache before v2.7 and of quartz scheduler v1, but keep support of quartz scheduler v2 and of ehcache v2.7+ ([406ed79](../commit/406ed79))

### 1.87.0

* Drop support of Java 1.6. The minimum required Java version is 1.7 ([e12d9c7](../commit/e12d9c7)).
* You can still use javamelody 1.86.0 for Java 1.6.
* fix when using aggegrations of monitored applications in the optional collect server, hits counted twice and hits are increasing with all the hits of monitored applications each minute if the collect server is not restarted after adding the aggregation ([f77e5d6](../commit/f77e5d6), [93ac1b0](../commit/93ac1b0)).

* fix [JENKINS-64074](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-64074), links in the Administer page categorized in "Status Information"
* added: In Jenkins, the Overall/SystemRead permission now allows to view the monitoring pages of the monitoring plugin. To have this permission, you need the [extended read permission plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/extended-read-permission/). But the Overall/SystemRead permission does not allow to run state changing actions such as Run GC, Take heap dump or Destroy http sessions (the Administer permission is still needed for these actions). [JENKINS-62432](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-62432).
* in the [javamelody-spring-boot-starter](SpringBootStarter), added `@ConditionalOnMissingBean` on `SchedulerFactoryBeanCustomizer` ([PR 973](../pull/973), thanks to *opera4130*).
* added thousand separator for numbers in the MBeans report ([PR 979](../pull/979), thanks to *Fabio Boldrini*).
* added new javamelody parameter `datadog-api-host` for specifying Datadog base API host such as `api.datadoghq.eu` (`api.datadoghq.com` by default, see [doc](UserGuideAdvanced#sending-metrics-to-datadog), [PR 971](../pull/971), thanks to *Michal Kebrt*).
* added new javamelody parameter `statsd-prefix` for the prefix of the metric names in StatsD (`javamelody.context.host.` by default and where context and host gets replaced by the actual values, see [doc](UserGuideAdvanced#sending-metrics-to-statsd), [PR 970](../pull/970), thanks to *Michal Kebrt*).
* fix the [example of JSP page](UserGuideAdvanced#jsp-tags-for-prometheus) for custom Prometheus metrics, by adding `<%@ page session="false"%>`

* added Chinese traditional (Taïwan) translations, (language "zh-TW", [63dd373](../commit/63dd373), thanks to *Jack*)
* updated Czech translations, (language "cs", [4cee901](../commit/4cee901), thanks to *Kamil Steinbach*)
* To contribute in your own language, join the translation project at <https://poeditor.com/join/project/QIaCp4bThS>.

### 1.86.0

* fix [#940](../issues/940) When using the [Spring boot starter](SpringBootStarter), hits on Quartz jobs are not displayed in the monitoring page.
* fix [#936](../issues/936) heap histo report missing with OpenJDK from third party providers.
* fix [#943](../issues/943) incorrect Italian translation (thanks to *massimosala*). To contribute in your own language, join the translation project at <https://poeditor.com/join/project/QIaCp4bThS>.

### 1.85.0

* fix display of sources of spring-boot classes ([58afda8](../commit/58afda8)).
* fix [#919](../issues/919) heap histo report failed with an early access version of the jdk, such as 15-ea.
* fix [#916](../issues/916) Monitoring a jdbc DataSource in WebLogic Server 12.2.1.4.
* In the [Jenkins Monitoring plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Monitoring), fix [JENKINS-61519](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-61519): Odd rendering of Monitoring of Jenkins master in Manage Jenkins screen.
* added monitoring of Mongodb from the new Spring's MongoDatabaseFactory like from MongoDbFactory ([43074aa](../commit/43074aa))

### 1.84.0

* Canceled

### 1.83.0

* improved: If there are http or sql requests with many dynamic values like "/get/entity/10" or "select \* from table where id in (123, 456)" (dynamic values in sql without binded parameters), you should already use the [javamelody parameters](UserGuide#6-optional-parameters) `http-transform-pattern` or `sql-transform-pattern`, in order to limit disk IO and disk space usage for the statistics and RRD graphs. If you forget that, some RRD files will now be automatically deleted everyday at midnight to limit the disk space used by RRD files under 20 MB. You may configure that limit with the javamelody parameter `max-rrd-disk-usage-mb` (20 by default). And old statistics and graphs are automatically deleted like before. ([553b323](../commit/553b323))
* fix in the [Liferay plugin](LiferayPlugin), to allow JDBC monitoring in Tomcat in an OSGi environment (Liferay 7+), [PR 15](https://github.com/javamelody/liferay-javamelody/pull/15) thanks to *Adrián Rodríguez*. See [doc](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/wiki/LiferayPlugin#sql-monitoring).
* fix [#910](../issues/910) In the [optional collect server](UserGuideAdvanced#optional-centralization-server-setup), only one instance registered when using MonitoringFilter.registerApplicationNodeInCollectServer in several instances.
* fix [#9](https://github.com/javamelody/jira-confluence-javamelody/issues/9) in [JIRA/Confluence/Bamboo/Bitbucket monitoring plugin](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/wiki/AtlassianPlugin), blank page when accessing /monitoring in Bamboo 7.
* fix [#912](../issues/912) WELD-ENV-000015: Unable to load annotation: javax.ejb.Asynchronous, when using CDI with WELD in Tomcat.
* improved: Database report on locks for Postgresql 9.2+ ([e349ac0](../commit/e349ac0)).
* added: If using the `authorized-users` javamelody parameter, you may not want to write the parameter like `user:password` as clear text in configuration or script files, so you can write it like `user:{SHA-256}c33d66fe65ffcca1f2260e6982dbf0c614b6ea3ddfdb37d6142fbec0feca5245` with a one-way hash of the password instead ([92e04f2](../commit/92e04f2)). To compute the hash of the password (with a fixed salt against [rainbow tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table)):
  + use the html page at .../monitoring?part=hashPassword in a webapp monitored by javamelody 1.83.0 or later (it is recommended to choose a complex password and the SHA-256 algorithm at least)
  + or use the html page at <http://javamelody.org/demo/monitoring?part=hashPassword>
  + or on the command line: `java -cp javamelody-core-1.83.0.jar net.bull.javamelody.internal.common.MessageDigestPasswordEncoder passwordToHash` (Download [javamelody-core-1.83.0.jar](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/releases/download/javamelody-core-1.83.0/javamelody-core-1.83.0.jar))
* added: [doc](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/wiki/SpringBootStarter#security) to configure security of the monitoring reports in Spring boot, using Spring security for example.
* added: if using Tomcat, display sources of Tomcat's classes from stack-traces like for the webapp's dependencies ([9907e93](../commit/9907e93)).
* added: As an external API, dump of graphs values as XML or as TXT, for the choosen period or for all periods ([d11e6a8](../commit/d11e6a8)). See [doc](ExternalAPI#dump-graph-as-xml-or-txt).
* added: Links to Last value, Dump XML, Dump TXT below the zoomed graphics ([3967ea2](../commit/3967ea2)).
* added: In the [optional collect server](UserGuideAdvanced#optional-centralization-server-setup), display an alert in the report of a monitored application with several nodes, if some of the nodes are unavailable ([481da3e](../commit/481da3e)).

### 1.82.0

* fix [#890](../issues/890), warnings on javamelody-prometheus.tld when org.apache.catalina.STRICT\_SERVLET\_COMPLIANCE=true in Tomcat
* fix [#889](../issues/889), GSON format should not depend on XStream.
* improved: in the http sessions, identify the new MS Edge browser as Edg instead of Chrome ([304819f](../commit/304819f)).
* optimized: when displaying the report, lazy load images in "Other charts" ([cb18db5](../commit/cb18db5)).
* clarify that statistics in reports starts at midnight (in the server's time zone), for example "1 day since midnight" ([#897](../issues/897)).
* added: log the response status when using the javamelody log parameter ([#888](../pull/888)).
* added: when [monitoring with Spring](UserGuide#9-business-facades-if-spring) using AspectJ with [net/bull/javamelody/monitoring-spring-aspectj.xml](../blob/master/javamelody-core/src/main/resources/net/bull/javamelody/monitoring-spring-aspectj.xml), Spring's Cglib can be used instead with [net/bull/javamelody/monitoring-spring-aop.xml](../blob/master/javamelody-core/src/main/resources/net/bull/javamelody/monitoring-spring-aop.xml) ([ee919d0](../commit/ee919d0)).

### 1.81.0

* fix [#869](../issues/869), `PersistenceException: No Persistence provider for EntityManager`, with Hibernate 5.4 and JPA. And now, the JPA monitoring is always enabled when using JPA 2 directly, even if `<provider>net.bull.javamelody.JpaPersistence</provider>` is not added in persistence.xml.
* fix [#871](../issues/871), thanks to *Vicente Rossello Jaume*: In the [optional collect server](UserGuideAdvanced#optional-centralization-server-setup), each current request already displayed once is not displayed anymore after refresh.
* fix [#876](../issues/876), StopWatch not displayed in statistics by default.
* In the [Jenkins Monitoring plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Monitoring), fix [JENKINS-60433](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-60433): JEP-200 error on HsErrPid.
* Look further to display the remote user in the current requests, in case of [Jenkins plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/monitoring) or [JIRA/Confluence/Bamboo plugin](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/20909/javamelody-monitoring-plugin). And add sessionId attribute in the current requests for the [External API](ExternalAPI). ([PR 873](../pull/873), thanks to *Eugene Kortov*)
* fix [#884](../issues/884), CircularReferenceException in [External API](ExternalAPI) with JSON for current requests.
* added: Google Gson dependency as an alternative to the XStream dependency for JSON in the [External API](ExternalAPI) (see [doc](ExternalAPI#gson), [b7adc5b](../commit/b7adc5b)).
* added: graph of Usable disk space next to Free disk space in "Other charts" (the usable disk space may be lower than the free disk space, [#875](../issues/875)).
* added: if the monitoring of a Jenkins server is added in the [optional collect server](UserGuideAdvanced#optional-centralization-server-setup), the monitoring of Jenkins nodes including builds are automatically added at the same time ([ee06c01](../commit/ee06c01)).

### 1.80.0

* After the [JavaMelody real case 1](RealCase1), the [real case 2](RealCase2) is the investigation of a Java application with some very slow screens, with detailed explanation on monitoring metrics, statistics and found issues. And the [real case 3](RealCase3) on the investigation of why dozen of users are working extra-hours and of other issues. [#JavaMelodyRealCase](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23JavaMelodyRealCase)
* fix [#851](../issues/851): When using spring-boot and when having @Service and @MonitoredWithSpring, @Async or @Scheduled on the same classes, hits are counted several times.
* fix [#848](../issues/848): When using spring-boot-devtools, NPE after hot restart.
* fix [#863](../issues/863): NullPointerException in JdbcWrapper if executeBatch without prepareStatement or addBatch
* added: monitor elasticsearch calls automatically, when using spring-boot-starter-data-elasticsearch or when ElasticsearchRestTemplate (or ElasticsearchTemplate) is in Spring's context ([1739587](../commit/1739587)).
* added JSP tags to export other metrics to Prometheus: from MBeans like in JMX, from custom java code, from statistics of some HTTP request or of other request (see [documentation](UserGuideAdvanced#jsp-tags-for-prometheus), [6fbf3d8](../commit/6fbf3d8)).
* added new Prometheus metrics in `.../monitoring?format=prometheus`: used non-heap memory, used buffered memory, used physical memory, used swap space, loaded classes count ([a704562](../commit/a704562)).
* added: In the [optional collect server](UserGuideAdvanced#optional-centralization-server-setup), for an application using several server instances to monitor, it was possible either to add each server instance in the collect server to have graphs and statistics for each instance separately, or to add all instances at once to have aggregated graphs and statistics. But not both, until now. You can now have both by adding each instance one by one, and then you can add an aggregation of these instances, with the buttons at top of the monitoring pages. Note that having N separated + 1 aggregated pages for graphs and statistics needs N times more disk space than only the aggregated data.
* In the [Jenkins Monitoring plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Monitoring), added a graph in /monitoring/nodes of the sum of waiting durations in seconds of the builds in the build queue, next to the graph of the build queue length ([efa4d03](https://github.com/jenkinsci/monitoring-plugin/commit/efa4d0317122ed629190d7206a32a462a0228b5f)).
* improved some German translations ([PR 868](../pull/868), thanks to *Marco W.*)

### 1.79.0

* fix: when no content in the http response, MonitoringFilter should not flush buffer, caused by [e0c2fe0](../commit/e0c2fe0) since 1.78.0. (fixed by [068775a](../commit/068775a) for [JENKINS-58419](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-58419): No redirect after CAS login, in the [Jenkins Monitoring plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Monitoring)).
* fix [#843](../issues/843): Tomcat info is not available anymore since Tomcat 8.5.35 and Tomcat 9.0.13.
* fix [#847](../issues/847): When downloading more than 2GB, assertionError may occur.
* fix: for a JSR107 jcache, the clear button and the link to cache keys are now unavailable, when the cache was created from a CacheManager initialized by an URI ([071032c](../commit/071032c)).
* added: monitor mongodb collections automatically, when using spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb or when MongoDbFactory is in Spring's context ([4c9d3af](../commit/4c9d3af)).
* In the [Jenkins Monitoring plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Monitoring), fix broken 'report' link in Available and Updated tabs of plugin manager ([JENKINS-58388](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-58388)).

### 1.78.0

* The [JavaMelody real case 1](RealCase1) is an investigation of a large web site with intermittent slowdowns. See how to analyze monitoring metrics and statistics and find the issues. [#JavaMelodyRealCase](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23JavaMelodyRealCase)
* added: support of JCache (javax cache api of JSR107) and of Ehcache3 ([#574](../issues/574) with help from *James Pether Sörling*). Caches using Ehcache 1 & 2 are already automatically displayed in the monitoring reports. And now, caches using any JCache providers, such as Ehcache3, are also displayed in the reports. To display efficiency values, it is needed to enable JCache statistics. For example, in your ehcache.xml file:

```
<config xmlns:xsi='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance' xmlns='http://www.ehcache.org/v3'
    xmlns:jsr107='http://www.ehcache.org/v3/jsr107' xsi:schemaLocation="
        http://www.ehcache.org/v3 http://www.ehcache.org/schema/ehcache-core-3.0.xsd
        http://www.ehcache.org/v3/jsr107 http://www.ehcache.org/schema/ehcache-107-ext-3.0.xsd">
  <service>
    <jsr107:defaults enable-management="true" enable-statistics="true"/>
  </service>
  ...

</config>
```

* added: display an alert at the top of the monitoring page when there is an exception while collecting data, in order to make easier to fix basic technical issues in javamelody ([a7a8b26](../commit/a7a8b26)). For example, `IOException: No space left on device`.
* fix to still flush the response when no content in FilterServletResponseWrapper.flushBuffer() ([#836](../issues/836))
* fix the database reports for MariaDb following [PR 820](../pull/820) ([45dc506](../commit/45dc506))
* added: SQLite support in the database reports ([PR 840](../pull/840), thanks to *mpe85*)
* added: Czech translations ([2d85a88](../commit/2d85a88), thanks to *Lukáš Karabec*)
* improved: missing German translations ([c19539b](../commit/c19539b), thanks to *Michael Dobrovnik*)
* To contribute in your own language, join the translation project at <https://poeditor.com/join/project/QIaCp4bThS>.
* In the [Jenkins Monitoring plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Monitoring), improved the rendering of the management links in the Administer page ([JENKINS-57373](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-57373)). Note that the link on "*Monitoring of memory, cpu, http requests and more in Jenkins master.*" goes to the "/monitoring" page. And the link on "*You can also view the monitoring of builds, build queue and Jenkins nodes.*" goes to the "/monitoring/nodes" page.

### 1.77.0

* fix: When using Spring and LazyConnectionDataSourceProxy or other DelegatingDatasource, exclude it from the monitoring if the target datasource is already monitored ([d6ced5c](../commit/d6ced5c)).
* added: ability to upload heap dump files to [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) ([PR 810](../pull/810), thanks to *Salah Qasem*). See [doc](UserGuideAdvanced#upload-heap-dumps-to-aws-s3) (scroll down if the target page does not scroll to the right chapter).
* added: in the database reports, added support for MariaDB ([PR 820](../pull/820), thanks to *Vicente Rossello Jaume*).
* improved: in the [Jenkins Monitoring plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Monitoring), better aggregation of http requests. The javamelody parameter used by default in this plugin is now `-Djavamelody.http-transform-pattern=/\d+/|(?<=/static/|/adjuncts/|/bound/)[\w\-]+|(?<=/ws/|/user/|/testReport/|/javadoc/|/site/|/violations/file/|/cobertura/).+|(?<=/job/).+(?=/descriptorByName/)`.
* added: Italian translations ([ffc028f](../commit/ffc028f), thanks to *Gianluca Maiorino*)
* added: Ukrainian translations ([073bc6d](../commit/073bc6d), thanks to *Yevgen Lasman*)
* To contribute in your own language, join the translation project at <https://poeditor.com/join/project/QIaCp4bThS>.
* You can already monitor the executions of methods [using Spring](UserGuide#9-business-facades-if-spring), [EJB or CDI](UserGuide#8-business-facades-ejb-jarxml-file-if-ejb3-or-cdi) or [simple interfaces](UserGuideAdvanced#business-facades-without-ejb3-and-without-spring-and-without-guice). But if you want to monitor only a piece of code without creating a method around that piece of code, you can do now like the following and the results will be displayed in the statistics ([18ed237](../commit/18ed237)):

```
    try (Stopwatch stopwatch = new Stopwatch("name you want")) {
        // your piece of code
    }
```

### 1.76.0

* You can now contribute translations for javamelody by using a dedicated website at POEditor. You may contribute some "untranslated" labels for German and Portuguese or you may contribute new translations for Spanish (under way), Italian or your own language. Join the translation project at <https://poeditor.com/join/project/QIaCp4bThS>. ~~For technical reasons, [Chinese translations](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/blob/master/javamelody-core/src/main/resources/net/bull/javamelody/resource/translations_zh.properties) are not available in that website.~~
* fix [#795](../issues/795): Session count when using Tomcat cluster with sessions replication, after restarting one instance.
* fix NullPointerException when getting an Oracle explain plan for a SQL request from the optional collect server.
* fix incorrect name in MongoWrapper ([#807](../pull/807), thanks to *Pablo Palazon*)
* fix for Prometheus integration: exclude metrics which have no sense (javamelody\_log\_duration\_millis, javamelody\_log\_errors\_count, javamelody\_error\_errors\_count) and metrics for statistics which are not displayed in the reports ([e1db7c5](../commit/e1db7c5), [c0f34a2](../commit/c0f34a2))
* fix [#806](../issues/806) for Prometheus integration again: it was printed '<?>' instead of NaN, for 'lastValue' on Java 8 and before.
* Removed the monitoring of `@Asynchronous` method when using CDI/EJB, to fix [#802](../issues/802) `MonitoringAsynchronousCdiInterceptor must have at least one @InterceptorBinding` in TomEE plume ([31b723c](../commit/31b723c)).
  Note that you can continue as before to monitor CDI/EJB methods with a javamelody annotation or by configuration, see [doc](UserGuide#8-business-facades-ejb-jarxml-file-if-ejb3-or-cdi).
* In the [javamelody-spring-boot-starter](SpringBootStarter), added the dependency spring-boot-starter-aop and the javamelody.advisor-auto-proxy-creator-enabled property is now false by default, because it was causing issues such as [#756](../issues/756) for `@PreAuthorize`, [#643](../issues/643) for `@Scheduled`, for `@FeignClient` and others. ([21d904d](../commit/21d904d)). If ever you need to enable back the auto-proxy, add the following in application.yml: `javamelody.advisor-auto-proxy-creator-enabled: true`.
* In the [javamelody-spring-boot-starter](SpringBootStarter), the property javamelody.scheduled-monitoring-enabled is now true by default, to automatically monitor `@Scheduled` methods.
* added: In the [javamelody-spring-boot-starter](SpringBootStarter), Spring `@FeignClient`s are automatically monitored. ([0af308b](../commit/0af308b))
* added: In the [javamelody-spring-boot-starter](SpringBootStarter) again, if you already use a management http port different from the default application http port, you may expose the monitoring reports on the management port instead of the application port. See [doc](SpringBootStarter#configuration-in-case-of-management-port) for configuration. ([#601](../issues/601), thanks to *Anders Båtstrand* and *breneb*)

### 1.75.0

* Fix [#794](../issues/794) Compatibility with Google App Engine using Java 8.
* Fix [#779](../issues/779) When using JSVC to launch Tomcat, InternalError: errno: 13 error: Unable to open directory /proc/self/fd
* Fix [#787](../issues/787) An invalid character [32] was present in the Cookie value, when using the optional collect server in Tomcat.
* Document the compatibility and [installation](AtlassianPlugin#Bitbucket) of the JIRA/Confluence/Bamboo plugin with Bitbucket.
* Enhanced: added X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN in the reports.

Added the Offline viewer tool for some degraded cases:

* If ever you don't have access to the online reports of javamelody on the running server,
* or if you want to view the reports of aggregated data for several instances of an application and you don't use the optional [collect server](UserGuideAdvanced#optional-centralization-server-setup) and separated reports are not enough,
* or if you want to view the reports but the server is no longer running,
* or if you want some pdf reports and you have not included the [iText dependency](UserGuide#dependencies),
* then the offline viewer may be for you. See [doc](UserGuideAdvanced#offline-viewer)

### 1.74.0

* It is a **recommended upgrade for security** to fix a [XML External Entity (XXE) processing](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_%28XXE%29_Processing) vulnerability. CVE-ID is [CVE-2018-15531](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15531). Thanks to *mounsurf & huanying* for reporting the vulnerability.
* fix sql monitoring from jndi datasource when Tomcat's ServerInfo.properties is customized ([38211a7](../commit/38211a74776037d4e7b67b75df44f3879248ef4a))
* fix: do not require Log4J when sending metrics to [InfluxDB](UserGuideAdvanced#sending-metrics-to-influxdb) or [Datadog](UserGuideAdvanced#sending-metrics-to-datadog).
* In the [Jenkins Monitoring plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Monitoring), fix [#768](../issues/768): warning logs about serializing anonymous classes.
* added: native calendar widget to choose dates for a custom period ([84a1d63](../commit/84a1d63321449f71dec6069d3e712ee67e3ef5d6), with help from my colleague Fabien at [KleeGroup](http://www.kleegroup.com))
* added: workaround a JBoss and WildFly bug in MBeans tree ([#757](../issues/757))
* added: it is now possible to customize css and js of the monitoring reports by adding the `/net/bull/javamelody/resource/themedMonitoring.css` and `/net/bull/javamelody/resource/themedMonitoring.js` files as resources in your application, in order to override or add values. This is the case for example in the [javamelody dark theme](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody-dark-theme) which is ready to use as a Maven dependency in your pom.xml:

```
<dependency>
	<groupId>net.bull.javamelody</groupId>
	<artifactId>javamelody-dark-theme</artifactId>
	<version>1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

**Dark theme:**

### 1.73.1

* Compatibility with JDK 9: `-Djdk.attach.allowAttachSelf=true` is no longer required to have heap histogram and fix the display of source for a JDK class.
* fix [#398](../issues/398): heaphisto report failed -- unsatisfied link error with multiple webapps in tomcat
* fix [#585](../issues/585): ClassNotFound for heap dump on wildfly 10

### 1.73.0

* Compatibility with JDK 9: fix heap dump and heap histogram, display again the graphs of cpu, opened files and physical memory. ~~Note: to have the memory histogram in JDK 9 or later, add -Djdk.attach.allowAttachSelf=true in the java command line.~~
* Fix "no token found" with Prometheus integration for a Windows server ([e47b11b](../commit/e47b11bbaf0772151a7cae8ff97227516cd86b04))
* When using the optional collect server, fix the view of java source ([0ea7e76](../commit/0ea7e76e448453ad7dc17ef6de90f011a494516e))
* Upgrade build of [javamelody-spring-boot-starter](SpringBootStarter) to Java 8 and Spring-boot 2 ([#741](../issues/741)).
* Enhancement: When using Spring MVC, use path from [@RequestMapping](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/RequestMapping.html) annotations as http request name, in order to reduce the need of http-transform-pattern parameter ([242fb14](../commit/242fb14eac82f65c537cac440c40f59c5ab3628b))
* Enhancement: After generating a heap dump, zip it to reduce its size ([98cb8bc](../commit/98cb8bc08103f2ff00a4f5e72be64ddf278f2656))
* Added: The mean number of allocated Kilobytes per request is now displayed in the stats, next to the mean cpu per request. It is the memory used in the heap per request and which will have to be cleaned by the Garbage Collector later. And when more memory is used per request, more cpu will be used by the GC. As an example, 1 Gb allocated in a request, without a good reason, is probably a problem. ([33fe61d](../commit/33fe61d5af0dc46a35c1f1a0dc26952651612055))
* Added: when crash logs (hs\_err\_pid\*.log files) are found, display them in the system actions ([5ebb28e](../commit/5ebb28e9bfe98cacef6c95c9d3b5f338a444efc9))
* Added: in the zoomed charts, display of the [95th percentile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burstable_billing) line. It shows what would be the maximum on the period if 5% of the highest values (short peaks) were excluded ([9f7acba](../commit/9f7acba4e1d21658be9db2f807a7864787c04e78))
* If you use [SpringBootAdmin v1](http://codecentric.github.io/spring-boot-admin/1.5.7/), there is a new module to integrate javamelody in SpringBootAdmin. See [doc](https://github.com/javamelody/spring-boot-admin-server-ui-javamelody#javamelody-ui-module-for-springbootadmin-v1). SpringBootAdmin is a server to manage and monitor Spring-boot applications and which is a bit like the javamelody [collect server](UserGuideAdvanced#optional-centralization-server-setup). (Thanks to *dvtoever* for this [PR](https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/pull/450)).
* fix rare issue: ArithmeticException: / by zero in JRobin RRD files ([JENKINS-51590](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-51590)).
* Removed the `prometheus-include-last-value` javamelody parameter and replaced it by the `includeLastValue` http parameter ([08aacb2](../commit/08aacb2fdc122a383ad4590c1426b8e129552480), see [doc](UserGuideAdvanced#exposing-metrics-to-prometheus)). So, in the improbable case that you used `prometheus-include-last-value` for Prometheus integration, change your scrape\_config to:

```
    params:
      format: ['prometheus']
      includeLastValue: ['true']
```

### 1.72.0

* In the [Jenkins Monitoring plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Monitoring), fix [#735](../issues/735): NPE when there are no executors.
* Fix [#737](../issues/737) for StatsD integration.
* Fix [#731](../issues/731): When using [CloudWatch](UserGuideAdvanced#sending-metrics-to-aws-cloudwatch), Cloudwatch metric upload can't handle more then 20 items (with help from *marcrelation*).
* Fix [#668](../issues/668): `RrdException: Invalid timestamps specified` in some particular case when using custom period.
* Enhanced: when using the optional collect server and when having several nodes in a monitored application, if a node is unavailable, continue to collect data with the others ([#736](../issues/736)).

### 1.71.1

* For the JIRA/Confluence/Bamboo plugin only, fix broken auth when using JIRA 7.7.1.

### 1.71.0

* Fix [#700](../issues/700) for Prometheus integration (with help from *Stefan Penndorf*).
* Fix [#701](../issues/701) for Datadog integration (PR [#702](../pull/702), thanks to *bluegaspode*).
* Fix [#718](../issues/718): NPE when displaying the webapp dependencies in some particular case.
* In the [Jenkins Monitoring plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Monitoring), added JEP-200 exclusions when using monitoring with slaves (PR [#6](https://github.com/jenkinsci/monitoring-plugin/pull/6) thanks to Jesse Glick)
* improved: Warn in the reports if multiple instances use the same storage directory ([#692](../issues/692))
* improved: If the `application-name` parameter is defined, use it when publishing metrics to InfluxDB, Graphite, StatsD, CloudWatch or Datadog instead of the context path ([#694](../issues/694))
* improved: When there are more than 10 monitored applications (for ex. 60) in the same optional collector server, display a usable table instead of a long list ([#675](../issues/675))
* added: When using the optional collect server with ephemeral applications or application's nodes (for example with load-based auto scaling), the addresses and status of the nodes may change dynamically and you may find difficult to manually maintain the list of applications to monitor in the collect server. In that case, you can call an api in your application code to automatically register the application or the application's node when starting and unregister it when stopping. See [doc](UserGuideAdvanced#7-automatic-registration-of-applications). ([#679](../issues/679))
* added: When using the [reports by mail](UserGuide#14-weekly-daily-or-monthly-reports-by-mail), a new javamelody parameter `mail-subject-prefix` can be used to configure the subject of the mail notification. For example, in a Tomcat context file: `<Parameter name='javamelody.mail-subject-prefix' value='Production environment JavaMelody reports for {0}' override='false'/>` (PR [#710](../pull/710), thanks to *vkpandey82*)
* added: In the [External API](ExternalAPI), the url `monitoring?part=lastValue&format=json` now returns all the last values by names. (The url `monitoring?part=lastValue&graph=usedMemory` already returns the last value of a single graph by name.)

### 1.70.0

* added: integration with **Prometheus**: Metrics are already displayed in the monitoring reports. You can also scrape the same metrics from [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) at the frequency you wish for advanced visualizations, if you have a Prometheus server installed (PR [#682](../pull/682) & PR [#684](../pull/684), thanks to *slynn1324*). See [doc](UserGuideAdvanced#exposing-metrics-to-prometheus).
* added integration with **StatsD**: Metrics are already displayed in the charts of the monitoring reports. As an extra, you can also publish the same metrics to [StatsD](https://github.com/etsy/statsd), if you have a StatsD daemon installed. The parameter is `statsd-address`, see [doc](UserGuideAdvanced#sending-metrics-to-statsd). ([92aeffe](../commit/92aeffe800194544b9c91c1c799b36e74d4b7436))
* fix [#672](../issues/672): because of issues with aspectj / auto-proxy in some cases, methods annotated by [@Async](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/annotation/Async.html), [@Scheduled](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/annotation/Scheduled.html) or [@Schedules](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/annotation/Schedules.html) are no longer automatically monitored when using `net/bull/javamelody/monitoring-spring.xml`. They are now monitored by adding `net/bull/javamelody/monitoring-spring-scheduled.xml` in the Spring context.
* fix [#681](../issues/681): upgrade prototype.js, effects.js and slider.js
* fix [#665](../issues/665): fix jdbc undeploy in WildFly 10.1.0 / JBoss EAP 7.0 (with help from *Christoph Böhme*)
* In Jira 6+, make sure that the current user is an ApplicationUser ([PR #2](https://github.com/javamelody/jira-confluence-javamelody/pull/2), thanks to *Andreas Ebert*)
* In **Bamboo 6+**, fix [#671](../issues/671): Monitoring page forbidden
* In the javamelody grails plugin, when using **Grails 3.2.11**, fix [#43](https://github.com/javamelody/grails-melody-plugin/issues/43), "No signature of method: java.lang.String.encodeAsHTML()", ([PR #50](https://github.com/javamelody/grails-melody-plugin/pull/50), thanks to *Graeme Rocher* and *Sébastien Martin*) and fix [#48](https://github.com/javamelody/grails-melody-plugin/issues/48): "No value for key [org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.LazyConnectionDataSourceProxy] bound to thread" ([PR #51](https://github.com/javamelody/grails-melody-plugin/pull/51), thanks to *Sébastien Martin*)

### 1.69.0

* fix [#648](../issues/648): When using Quartz 2.2, IncompatibleClassChangeError: Found interface org.quartz.Trigger, but class was expected.
* In the [Jenkins plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Monitoring), fix NPE when using [CloudWatch](UserGuideAdvanced#sending-metrics-to-aws-cloudwatch) or [Graphite](UserGuideAdvanced#sending-metrics-to-graphite) ([3e2b872](../commit/3e2b8720f90514c000519055635ad0bb5f426531)).
* In the [Jenkins plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Monitoring) with FreeBSD, fix [JENKINS-45963](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-45963): if the collect fails for one slave, continue with the others
* fix: when having several monitored webapps and for each one a different datasource and the javamelody `datasources` parameter, the sql statistics may be displayed in the monitoring of the wrong webapp ([b06f34f](../commit/b06f34f27051833e084048b6d928bce7a00a9253) and [93960c0](../commit/93960c08daddddae7dd01fc81eafa2a84d6d75fa)).
* added integration with **InfluxDB**: Metrics are already displayed in the charts of the monitoring reports. Like integrations with [Graphite](UserGuideAdvanced#sending-metrics-to-graphite) and [AWS CloudWatch](UserGuideAdvanced#sending-metrics-to-aws-cloudwatch), you can also publish the same metrics to [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/) for advanced visualizations, if you have an InfluxDB server installed. The parameter is `influxdb-url`, see [doc](UserGuideAdvanced#sending-metrics-to-influxdb). ([f7c8503](../commit/f7c850361bec907aaba39861e473092043e75cc4))
* added integration with **Datadog**: Like for InfluxDB, you can also publish the same metrics to [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) for advanced visualizations. The parameter is `datadog-api-key`, see [doc](UserGuideAdvanced#sending-metrics-to-datadog). ([239aa4e](../commit/239aa4e4cdf3c2943caff779a2f5492772f1500f))
* Removed HibernateBatchFactory from [source](../blob/javamelody-core-1.68.0/javamelody-core/src/main/java/net/bull/javamelody/HibernateBatcherFactory.java) and from [wiki](UserGuideAdvanced/_compare/c5568760fc8c7fa0f1e0657b835acd7233bf2ffe...7f26893c63b22b750390bb3ad7c296e31dab8582), which is certainly no longer used by anybody.

### 1.68.1

(for javamelody-core and javamelody-spring-boot-starter)

* fix [#645](../issues/645): When using Quartz 2, ClassNotFoundException: net.bull.javamelody.Quartz2Adapter (thanks to *cyburglar*)
* fix [#643](../issues/643): When using the javamelody-spring-boot-starter, scheduling of methods annotated with @Scheduled does not work. The monitoring of those method is now no longer enabled by default. To enable again the monitoring of those methods see the updated [doc](SpringBootStarter).

### 1.68.0

* improved (Brazilian) Portuguese translation (PR [#642](../pull/642), thanks to *Sandro Giacomozzi*).
* fix [#634](../issues/634): Deployment error related to CDI in WebLogic and warnings in JBoss (thanks to *jncharpin*)
* fix [#639](../issues/639): Deployment warning related to CDI in WebLogic 12.2 (thanks to *Michael Dobrovnik*)
* fix: When using JIRA v7, with the monitoring plugin, add again the "Monitoring" link in the menu of the Administration / System page ([38b8593](../../jira-confluence-javamelody/commit/38b8593bab6b2dd37b2a421e412133ad20ce43b8)).
* fix: When using the [Spring boot starter](SpringBootStarter), parameters were ignored in Spring Boot app deployed as war in Tomcat ([6e0b2cb](../commit/6e0b2cb79c8e6b5525e43801e1aa96f134f9baa2) for [#632](../issues/632)).
* fix [#638](../issues/638): When using [scripts and alerts](ScriptsAndAlerts), ClassNotFoundException in Jenkins if the monitored webapp is using Ehcache or Quartz jobs.
* fix [#42](https://github.com/javamelody/grails-melody-plugin/issues/42): In the JavaMelody Grails plugin, fix compatibility with Grails 3.3 (and starting with this release, it will not be compatible anymore with Grails 3.1 and before).
* fix [#46](https://github.com/javamelody/grails-melody-plugin/issues/46): The JavaMelody Grails plugin must load after grails-quartz plugin to allow full reconfiguration of the scheduler thread (thanks to *Jerry Boonstra*)
* Internal classes moved: At last, after years of waiting, it's possible in JDK 9 to have internal classes public but not accessible outside of the javamelody jar file, like if these classes were not public. So, many internal classes, which were not public and all in the `net.bull.javamelody` package, are now moved to `net.bull.javamelody.internal.*` packages. Beware, applications must not import the classes in the `net.bull.javamelody.internal.*` packages. And to be sure of that, a `module-info.java` file will be added and the internal packages will not be exported outside of the javamelody module. (As a reminder, the goal of having internal classes opposed to a public and documented API is to be able to refactor and improve the implementation freely without ever breaking applications.)
* added: With Spring, when using `net/bull/javamelody/monitoring-spring.xml` in the Spring context or when using the [Spring boot starter](SpringBootStarter), automatically monitor the execution of methods having a [@Controller](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/stereotype/Controller.html), [@RestController](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/RestController.html), [@Service](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/stereotype/Service.html), [@Async](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/annotation/Async.html), [@Scheduled](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/annotation/Scheduled.html) or [@Schedules](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/annotation/Schedules.html) annotation ([c7c45ab](../commit/c7c45ab3e1d833f8bc5c1e819fbf905088c6591f))
* added: When using EJB, automatically monitor the execution of methods having an [@Asynchronous](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/ejb/Asynchronous.html) annotation ([31b723c](../commit/31b723c27f0b08e664dd288618894fcc2d99ba66)).
* added integration with **Graphite**: Metrics are already displayed in the charts of the monitoring reports. As an extra, you can also publish the same metrics to [Graphite](https://graphiteapp.org/) for advanced visualizations, if you have a Graphite server installed. The parameter is `graphite-address`, see [doc](UserGuideAdvanced#sending-metrics-to-graphite). ([ce94787](../commit/ce947870ed120589c49b2e080ea7be17f8ef07b0))
* added integration with **AWS CloudWatch**: Like for Graphite, you can also publish the same metrics to [AWS CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) for custom visualizations and mail or autoscaling alarms, if you have AWS EC2 server instance(s) with detailed monitoring in AWS CloudWatch. The parameter is `cloudwatch-namespace`, see [doc](UserGuideAdvanced#sending-metrics-to-aws-cloudwatch). ([e65d605](../commit/e65d6054acec4b1126a212b9ec4605c020c7186a))
* added: In the list of threads, add an action to send an interrupt signal to a thread. The thread can test Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted() to stop itself. ([7977f2b](../commit/7977f2b98020aebbc254d1e19138782bed882d73))
* added: PDF link in the threads page ([b356132](../commit/b356132e06047fdae09fd63f5212464e7da9efe9))

### 1.67.0

* known major issue in 1.67.0, [#634](../issues/634): Deployment error related to CDI in **WebLogic** and warnings in **JBoss**.
* fix RUM monitoring when the URL ends with '/' in 1.66.0.
* fix [#617](../issues/617): Charts of http/sql stats can not be viewed after restarting the application (with help from *goldyliang*).
* fix [#622](../issues/622): In the collector server, malformed main html page when the monitored app is down.
* fix [#623](../issues/623): In the collector server, spikes on gc, transaction and cpu graphs after collector restart.
* fix: In the collector server, after a restart, a monitored application can't be removed if it is no longer available.
* fix [#631](../issues/631): When using the collector server, minor security issue if XML transport format with xstream is configured in the collector server parameters.
* fix: If the monitoring of an invalid JNDI datasource fails, don't ignore the others ([dca0b07](../commit/dca0b0756044d0cd91327afa88d8ba4465493a7b)).
* added: When using Ehcache, display keys from the caches and add ability to remove a specific key from a cache (PR [#630](../pull/630), thanks to *Aleksandr Mashchenko*).
* added: Display the number of http sessions and sessions mean size before the list of sessions, when there are more than 20 (PR [#629](../pull/629), thanks to *Aleksandr Mashchenko*).
* improved: When displaying Java sources from stack-traces, locate more sources by reading Maven pom.xml of the webapp and of the other dependencies, when they exist.
* added: Display **webapp dependencies** in a new page, accessed by a link in the System informations details, and include detailed name, website url, Maven groupId:artifactId:version and license of each dependency, based on Maven pom.xml files. ([e7607c1](../commit/e7607c19087d6b592c92c38b50b5e2fd1d9fd306), except in JIRA/Confluence/Bamboo because of OSGi restrictions)
* added: With Spring, when using `net/bull/javamelody/monitoring-spring.xml` in the Spring context or when using the [Spring boot starter](SpringBootStarter), add a link to display "**Spring beans**", in System informations next to the "JNDI tree" link ([5cd7c5a](../commit/5cd7c5a1a76e7e20c8c02ce7661aba067565067e)).
* added: With Spring again, when using `net/bull/javamelody/monitoring-spring.xml` in the Spring context or when using the [Spring boot starter](SpringBootStarter), if RestTemplate is used and if it is defined as Spring bean (for example, `<bean id="restTemplate" class="org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate" />`), then the REST http calls from the webapp with this RestTemplate are monitored and response times are displayed in the Spring statistics of the monitoring report ([b672ddb](../commit/b672ddb074ca8a3ad4c8b07c127465b62f1b363a)).
* added: In the **database reports**, 10 new reports for MySQL (with help from [MySQL perf analyzer](https://github.com/yahoo/mysql_perf_analyzer/blob/master/myperf/src/main/resources/sql.xml), Apache license): long running queries, statistics of tables, unused indexes, events waits summary, table access summary, index access summary, table lock wait summary, tables without PK, queries summary for the last 24h, memory summary (this last one works only in MySQL v5.7) and 1 new report for Oracle database: statistics of tables ([62d86d1](../commit/62d86d1238d414d96a97e4faa2ffb7bc99126d79)).
* added: When the webapp is built by Maven or when the [javamelody parameter](UserGuide#6-optional-parameters) `application-version` is set, the version of the webapp is displayed at the top of the report and a drop-down list of versions next to "Customized" period allows to display the report for the period of each version deployed, to compare between them for example. ([d61e65f](../commit/d61e65f82c936e5dc986e4f850d4a5998b9caa2d), based on an idea by *dhartford*).
* added: Like for [EJB monitoring](UserGuide#8-business-facades-ejb-jarxml-file-if-ejb3), monitor CDI (or EJB 3.1) beans by simply adding the `@net.bull.javamelody.Monitored` annotation on beans classes or methods to monitor ([3f60bff](../commit/3f60bffb64632559cb7f6b3645c1dcf5488dca63)).
* added: **[Real User Monitoring (RUM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_user_monitoring)**. It allows to measure the experience from the end user perspective, by monitoring times in the browser for each html page until it is displayed and ready to be used ([b85652a](../commit/b85652a182d05517ad8151f4101d584ecc007517), see [doc](UserGuide#18-real-user-monitoring)).
* The Real User Monitoring works by injecting on the fly a [Boomerang](https://soasta.github.io/boomerang/doc/) javascript at the end of html pages, just before the `</body>` end tag, which sends data back to the monitoring in your server. Then in the detailed monitoring report of http requests for html pages, times and percentages are displayed for Network, Server execution, DOM processing and Page rendering, to compare which ones contribute to a good or bad end user experience. The Real User Monitoring does not add a noticeable overhead on the server, but the javascript adds a simple http(s) call for each html page, which may add a small overhead on the client browser.
* This Real User Monitoring is **not enabled by default**. To enable it, add a parameter `rum-enabled` in web.xml, in context or in system properties like the other [javamelody parameters](#6-optional-parameters). For example in your WEB-INF/web.xml file:

```
	<filter>
		<filter-name>javamelody</filter-name>
		<filter-class>net.bull.javamelody.MonitoringFilter</filter-class>
		<init-param>
			<param-name>rum-enabled</param-name>
			<param-value>true</param-value>
		</init-param>
	</filter>
	...
```

* improved: when using the net.bull.javamelody.JdbcDriver in your configuration (without a datasource), accept the driver class in the jdbc URL like in the jdbc properties ([617adff](../commit/617adff519dd56713bee3c8525a72b59213e6910)). For example in hibernate.cfg.xml:

```
<property name="hibernate.connection.driver_class">net.bull.javamelody.JdbcDriver</property>
<property name="hibernate.connection.url">jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/myschema?driver=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver</property>
```

or

```
<property name="hibernate.connection.driver_class">net.bull.javamelody.JdbcDriver</property>
<property name="hibernate.connection.driver">com.mysql.jdbc.Driver</property>
<property name="hibernate.connection.url">jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/myschema</property>
```

### 1.65.0

* fix NoSuchMethodError: net.sf.ehcache.Ehcache.getStatistics() in 1.64 (issue [#616](../issues/616))
* fix compatibility with **Java 9**. (PR [#609](../pull/609) for issue [#556](../issues/556) , thanks to *James Pether Sörling*)
* In the [Jenkins plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Monitoring), fix [JENKINS-42112](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-42112) : HTTP user session is reported as "anonymous" when using anything but AbstractPasswordBasedSecurityRealm (like Google login plugin or Cloudbees Operations Center).
* In the [Liferay plugin](LiferayPlugin), fix compatibility with **Liferay 7** ([649fd35](../commit/649fd357c28d35d561c5f62d6909a05720634a69) and PR [#7](https://github.com/javamelody/liferay-javamelody/pull/7) with help from *Inácio Nery* from Liferay, fixed in [1.63.1](https://github.com/javamelody/liferay-javamelody/releases))
* [Liferay plugin](LiferayPlugin) is now published in the [Liferay marketplace](https://web.liferay.com/marketplace/-/mp/application/86496285).
* improved: make easier the selection of the stack-trace text in the tooltips of the threads list ([736cf0e](../commit/736cf0ed88f81e8e4c0ef92b6151cfe62119bc17))
* added: **[javamelody spring boot starter](SpringBootStarter)** to simplify configuration of javamelody when using Spring Boot (PR [#615](../pull/615) thanks to *Georg Wittberger*).
* added: **pdf report in the detail page of a request**. ([28e2474](../commit/28e24742c6a2a9838ce1aaf34acb152b031e6497))
* added: links to view **java source from errors and threads stack-traces**. ([e5263bf](../commit/e5263bf08e36ab7be35c639ba7e2899d4c0ced5d))

[![source](resources/images/java_source.png)](resources/images/java_source.png)

* Source from the JDK and source from artifacts built by Maven and available in [Maven central](https://search.maven.org/) can be viewed. So if your server uses a JRE and not a JDK, source from the JDK are not available. And note that many artifacts available in Maven central were not built by Maven, for example Tomcat libraries, so sources of those artifacts can't be located.
* The javamelody parameter `maven-repositories` can be used like the other [javamelody parameters](UserGuide#6-optional-parameters), to search for sources of Maven artifacts in other repositories than your local repository and than Maven central, and such as your own company repository containing the sources of your own app. The parameter value must be a comma separated list of Maven repositories URLs (`~/.m2/repository,https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/` by default and recommended as last repositories). And if your repository needs basic authentication, you can insert "username:password" in the URL. For example in the web.xml :

```
    <filter>
        <filter-name>javamelody</filter-name>
        <filter-class>net.bull.javamelody.MonitoringFilter</filter-class>
        <init-param>
            <param-name>maven-repositories</param-name>
            <param-value>https://myusername:secret@repo.mycorp.com,~/.m2/repository,https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/</param-value>
        </init-param>
    </filter>
    ...
```

* added: new javamelody parameter `application-name`, to override the default one based on the context path of the webapp and on the hostname. Using this parameter will change the default storage directory path. (PR [#604](../pull/604) thanks to *kai-modrzok*)
* added: if the javamelody parameter `jmx-expose-enabled` is set to true, then **javamelody mbeans** are available with aggregated statistics data about requests. See [doc](UserGuideAdvanced#exposing-data-as-jmx-mbeans). (PR [#591](../pull/591) thanks to *Alexey Pushkin*)

[![mbeans](resources/images/javamelody-mbeans.png)](resources/images/javamelody-mbeans.png)

* doc added: [Summary of javamelody parameters](Parameters) to extend the [user's guide](UserGuide)
* removed: specific support of Jonas application server for datasource monitoring ([dab4131](../commit/dab4131c3d7d3d594779027d365224df324bc8f6))
* removed: zip file of sources is not published anymore in [releases](../releases), since source code is easy to [browse](..) or to download for each [release](../releases).
* moved: source and jar file download of the [JIRA / Confluence / Bamboo plugin](AtlassianPlugin) are moved to [a new repository](https://github.com/javamelody/jira-confluence-javamelody/releases)

### 1.63.0

* Fix **Liferay plugin compatibility** [issue 5](https://github.com/javamelody/liferay-javamelody/issues/5): Javamelody breaks web content edition, since Liferay 6.2 CE GA5 and EE SP13 and [issue 6](https://github.com/javamelody/liferay-javamelody/issues/6): since Liferay 6.2 EE SP15, error "Please select a valid change frequency" when editing a web content. (Fixed in 1.62.1)
* Sonar v6.1 released on October 13, 2016 is known to be incompatible with the [Sonar plugin](UserGuide#sonar-plugin). There is [PR 1305](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarqube/pull/1305) in Sonar to fix this issue. (Merged and released in Sonar v6.2).
* When using **JPA** Criteria API with Hibernate or EclipseLink, fix JPA requests names like `CriteriaQueryImpl@3b0cc2d` ([e60df91](../commit/e60df915229ca0d8d24fe16b1eb81a379f840e4e), with help from *Christoph Linder* who is at the origin of this change and [this page](https://antoniogoncalves.org/2012/05/24/how-to-get-the-jpqlsql-string-from-a-criteriaquery-in-jpa/) from *Antonio Goncalves*). For example, when using Hibernate, it will display JPQL instead, but still waiting Hibernate to [implement CriteriaQueryImpl.toString()](https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-10980).
* Refactored JPA code to make it more clear (thanks to *Christoph Linder*).
* fix [issue 592](../issues/592): some file handles may be left open when having frequent undeploy / redeploy.
* fix [issue 594](../issues/594) and [issue 596](../issues/596): StringIndexOutOfBoundsException in the reports and jdbc datasource not monitored, when using Paraya server (thanks to *Thomas Kernstock*).
* added: `/* BATCH */` prefix in batch sql requests to discern that in this case 1 hit is for a whole batch ([44bc752](../commit/44bc7527355f737fb2da55a102eef6e589fab43a)).
* added: configuration to be able to use forward instead of include in CustomResourceFilter ([PR 599](../pull/599) thanks to *James Pether Sörling* for [issue 597](../issues/597) using Vaadin).
* added: check for updated version of javamelody. If a new version is available, a message is now displayed at the top of the report to notify about the new version. For that, javamelody pings the server javamelody.org. And to better understand javamelody users, anonymous data such as java version and OS is sent to that server at the same time. An example of the data sent is: `{uniqueId="3d117c04b914c78ddbaf14818c404c8e88c6e56f", serverInfo="Apache Tomcat/8.5.9", javamelodyVersion="1.63.0", applicationType="Classic", javaVersion="Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment, 1.8.0_111-b14", jvmVersion="Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, 25.111-b14, mixed mode", maxMemory="1024", availableProcessors="4", os="Windows 7, Service Pack 1, amd64/64", databases="", countersUsed="http|sql|error|log", parametersUsed="log", featuresUsed="pdf", locale="fr_FR", usersMean=1, collectorApplications=-1}`.
* Usage stats based on the anonymous data will be publicly available at <http://javamelody.org/usage/stats> for applications using JavaMelody v1.63 or later and able to contact the server.
* You may disable the update check with the javamelody parameter `update-check-disabled=true` in web.xml, in context or in system properties like the other [javamelody parameters](UserGuide#6-optional-parameters).
* The **online demo** of javamelody is finally back. To see it, you can play a bit with [this app](http://javamelody.org/demo/) (written by Benjamin Durand some years ago) to be sure to have some data in http and sql statistics, then open the [monitoring page](http://javamelody.org/demo/monitoring) to explore the reports.

* added: monitoring **MongoDB** queries. See the [documentation](UserGuideAdvanced#mongodb-monitoring).
* added: in the [Spring Boot configuration](../blob/master/javamelody-for-spring-boot/src/main/java/hello/JavaMelodyConfiguration.java) example, automatic monitoring of Spring services and controllers, without having to use the `@MonitoredWithSpring` annotation.
* ~~added jpa-naming-strategy parameter to allow customization of request names displayed in JPA statistics. (based on [PR 567](../pull/567), thanks to *Christoph Linder*). But still waiting Hibernate to [implement CriteriaQueryImpl.toString()](https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-10980).~~
* upgraded jpa api to 2.1.
* New [javamelody plugin](https://github.com/javamelody/alfresco-javamelody) to monitor a [Alfresco](http://www.alfresco.com/) server. Documentation is [here](AlfrescoPlugin)

### 1.60.0

* Fix XSS in graph page ([PR 555](../pull/555), thanks to *Tim Helmstedt*)
* In the JavaMelody Grails plugin, migrate the plugin to Grails 3.x and upload it to Bintray ([grails PR 33](https://github.com/javamelody/grails-melody-plugin/pull/33), thanks to *Sergio Michels*). The plugin is available in Bintray [here](https://bintray.com/grails/plugins?filterByPkgName=grails-melody-plugin).
* Documentation for the JavaMelody Grails plugin is updated and moved at <http://www.grails.org/plugins.html#plugin/grails-melody-plugin>. For v1.60, you can install the plugin in Grails 3, with just a dependency:

```
dependencies {
    runtime 'org.grails.plugins:grails-melody-plugin:1.60.0'
}
```

* [Sergio Michels](https://github.com/sergiomichels) is now committer in the [JavaMelody Grails plugin](https://github.com/javamelody/grails-melody-plugin).
* ~~In the [Liferay plugin](LiferayPlugin), fix compatibility [issue 5](https://github.com/javamelody/liferay-javamelody/issues/5): Javamelody breaks web content edition, since Liferay 6.2 CE GA5 and EE sp13 (fixed in plugin [v1.59.2](https://github.com/javamelody/liferay-javamelody/releases/download/1.59.2/liferay-javamelody-hook-1.59.2.war))~~
* In the [Jenkins plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Monitoring), fix [JENKINS-34794](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-34794), Jenkins sometimes doesn't start because of transient NPE (thanks to *Félix Belzunce Arcos*)
* Limit error messages to 1000 characters and error stack-traces to 50000 characters, to avoid high memory consumption when log messages are very long ([PR 550](../pull/550), thanks to *Zdenek Henek*)
* added javamelody parameter `csrf-protection-enabled` to enable protection against [CSRF](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_%28CSRF%29) on actions such as run GC, invalidate sessions, kill thread by id ... (Not enabled by default since an attacker would need to know about javamelody in an application and about its URLs and would need to force an administrator to access the monitoring and even in this case, the attacker certainly can't make the application unvailable and can't steal data or anything.) To enable this protection, add the parameter in web.xml, in context or in system properties like the other [javamelody parameters](UserGuide#6-optional-parameters). For example, add the system property `javamelody.csrf-protection-enabled=true` in $CATALINA\_HOME/conf/catalina.properties if Tomcat.
* [Doc for JIRA / Confluence / Bamboo plugin](AtlassianPlugin) updated: In the datasource configuration, use maxTotal instead of maxActive since JIRA 7.0 or Confluence 5.9 (that is when using Tomcat 8).

### 1.59.0

* fix [JENKINS-23442](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-23442), In the [Jenkins plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Monitoring), ClassCircularityError: java/util/logging/LogRecord ([0ad60da](https://github.com/jenkinsci/monitoring-plugin/commit/0ad60da0038048ca69672022e54434cb3c5c87a3))

* fix [issue 503](../issues/503): incompatibility with JIRA 7 (fixed in v1.57.1)
* fix [issue 511](../issues/511): rename VERSION.properties to remove conflict with jgroups
* fix from [PR 505](../pull/505) and [PR 507](../pull/507): German translations (thanks to *mawulf*)
* fix from [grails PR 27](https://github.com/javamelody/grails-melody-plugin/pull/27): In the JavaMelody Grails plugin, fix uppercase environment names to lowercase (thanks to *timic*)
* fix from [grails PR 28](https://github.com/javamelody/grails-melody-plugin/pull/28): In the JavaMelody Grails plugin, fix cannot disable spring counter (thanks to *timic*)
* added: if Java 7 or later, 2 new graphs are displayed in "Other charts", below the main charts: "% System CPU" and "Used buffered memory" ([5029404](../commit/5029404eeb24e7b5c657453d06e9fc603fa5eb0d)).
  + **% System CPU** is the CPU usage for the whole system (not just the JVM), between 0 and 100%.
  + **Used buffered memory** is the memory used, either by *direct buffers* allocated outside of the garbage-collected heap, using [ByteBuffer.allocateDirect](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/ByteBuffer.html#allocateDirect%28int%29), or by *mapped buffers* created by mapping a region of a file into memory, using [FileChannel.map](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/channels/FileChannel.html#map%28java.nio.channels.FileChannel.MapMode,%20long,%20long%29).
* improved: limit the different child requests per request in statistics to a raisonnable number (10000), [issue 496](../issues/496).

### 1.57.0

* fix: check if **async** before flushing the response ([ee87b4b](../commit/ee87b4b0be7fb11fd0d81a27923732d674b932d7) thanks to *Mark Thomas*)
* fix [issue 338](../issues/338): JavaMelody swallows response when some Spring WebAsyncTask/Callable is used (fix thanks to *Violeta Georgieva*). The [web.xml example](UserGuide#2-webxml-file) in the User's guide is also changed for those Async requests with Servlet API 3.0.
* fix: used/max file descriptor counts are not displayed in oracle java 8 ([c04ef79](../commit/c04ef7925977f17566581b81909bb62780b947e9) thanks to *Colin Ingarfield*)
* fix [issue 488](../issues/488): IllegalStateException if a filter calls getWriter() before the MonitoringFilter
* fix: in latest **JIRA** versions, the monitoring report outputs garbage (because gzip compression is now enabled by default in JIRA ; the fix disables the gzip compression of the monitoring report)
* fix the monitoring of JNDI DataSources in Tomcat 8, for example in **Confluence 5.8** ([99767fb](../commit/99767fbe782805436a70543cd6adbdb2f26808a4)).
* fix [issue 480](../issues/480): StackOverflowError when applying sql-transform-pattern
* improved: **SQL keywords** are highlighted in statistics ([d78734c](../commit/d78734c3980b508ad678b9df3f10a89ea2559b72))
* added: it's now easy to write scripts to get monitoring data from a monitored webapp and to **send alerts** based on thresholds using Jenkins. See the [documentation](ScriptsAndAlerts).
* improved: An [api page](../blob/master/javamelody-core/src/main/resources/net/bull/javamelody/resource/help/api.html) is now available in the monitoring of your webapp with links to the <ExternalAPI>. The path of the page in your webapp is "monitoring?resource=help/api.html".
* [User's guide](UserGuide#6-optional-parameters) updated: better explain when to use http-transform-pattern or sql-transform-pattern (with help from *[Siegfried Goeschl](http://people.apache.org/~sgoeschl/blog/posts/javamelody/using-java-melody/)*)
* [User's guide](UserGuide#6-optional-parameters) updated: When using Tomcat, you can use [variable substitution](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/config/) with system properties in the context xml file or in the web.xml file of your webapp. For example, to set the storage directory relative to the Tomcat home, add the following in the context file of the webapp in Tomcat conf: `<Parameter name='javamelody.storage-directory' value='${catalina.base}/javamelody' override='false'/>`.
* [Advanced User's guide](UserGuideAdvanced#spring-boot-app) updated: JavaMelody install in **Spring-boot** is documented, with example app.
* [Jenkins plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Monitoring): scripts examples updated to get data from slaves in **[Jenkins Monitoring Scripts](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Monitoring%2BScripts)**, below the scripts for Jenkins master.
* added: javamelody-collector-server.war file is published in Maven Central ([issue 467](../issues/467)). This war file is optional and not needed in most use cases.
* note: there is an unfortunate incompatibility of this release v1.57.0 (isAsyncStarted) with servlet api 2.5 (Tomcat 6). This is now fixed and the fix is available in [nightly build](https://javamelody.ci.cloudbees.com/job/javamelody/).

### JavaMelody migration to Github

## Release notes

#### Since 1.85.0

See [Releases](https://plugins.jenkins.io/monitoring/#releases)

#### 1.84.0

Canceled

#### 1.83.0 (May 5, 2020)

* improved: The javamelody parameter `http-transform-pattern` is already used in the plugin, in order to limit disk IO and disk space usage for the statistics and RRD graphs of http requests. If that's not enough, some RRD files of graphs for http requests will now be automatically deleted everyday at midnight to limit the disk space used by RRD files under 20 MB. You may configure that limit with the javamelody parameter `max-rrd-disk-usage-mb` (20 by default). And old statistics and graphs are automatically deleted like before. ([553b323](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/commit/553b323))
* added: As an external API, dump of graphs values as XML or as TXT, for the choosen period or for all periods ([d11e6a8](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/commit/d11e6a8)). See [doc](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/wiki/ExternalAPI#dump-graph-as-xml-or-txt).
* added: Links to Last value, Dump XML, Dump TXT below the zoomed graphics ([3967ea2](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/commit/3967ea2)).
* added: if using Tomcat, display sources of Tomcat's classes from stack-traces like for the webapp's dependencies ([9907e93](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/commit/9907e93)).

#### 1.82.0 (Mar 1, 2020)

* improved: in the http sessions, identify the new MS Edge browser as Edg instead of Chrome ([304819f](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/commit/304819f)).
* optimized: when displaying the report, lazy load images in "Other charts" ([cb18db5](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/commit/cb18db5)).
* clarify that statistics in reports starts at midnight (in the server's time zone), for example "1 day since midnight" ([#897](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/897)).

#### 1.81.0 (Dec 29, 2019)

* fix [JENKINS-60433](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-60433): JEP-200 error on HsErrPid.
* fix [#871](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/871), thanks to Vicente Rossello Jaume: In the [optional collect server](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/wiki/UserGuideAdvanced#optional-centralization-server-setup), each current request already displayed once is not displayed anymore after refresh.
* Look further to display the remote user in the current requests. And add sessionId attribute in the current requests for the [External API](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/wiki/ExternalAPI). ([PR 873](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/pull/873), thanks to Eugene Kortov)
* fix [#884](https://github.com/jenkinsci/monitoring-plugin/blob/master/../issues/884), CircularReferenceException in [External API](https://github.com/jenkinsci/monitoring-plugin/blob/master/ExternalAPI) with JSON for current requests.
* added: graph of Usable disk space next to Free disk space in "Other charts" (the usable disk space may be lower than the free disk space, [#875](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/875)).
* added: if the monitoring of a Jenkins server is added in the [optional collect server](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/wiki/UserGuideAdvanced#optional-centralization-server-setup), the monitoring of Jenkins nodes including builds are automatically added at the same time ([ee06c01](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/commit/ee06c01)).

#### 1.80.0 (Nov 3, 2019)

* After the [JavaMelody real case 1](https://github.com/jenkinsci/monitoring-plugin/blob/master/RealCase1), the [real case 2](https://github.com/jenkinsci/monitoring-plugin/blob/master/RealCase2) is an the investigation of a Java application with some very slow screens, with detailed explanation on monitoring metrics, statistics and found issues. And the [real case 3](https://github.com/jenkinsci/monitoring-plugin/blob/master/RealCase3) on the investigation of why dozen of users are working extra-hours and of other issues. [#JavaMelodyRealCase](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23JavaMelodyRealCase)
* added a graph in /monitoring/nodes of the sum of waiting durations in seconds of the builds in the build queue, next to the graph of the build queue length ([efa4d03](https://github.com/jenkinsci/monitoring-plugin/commit/efa4d0317122ed629190d7206a32a462a0228b5f))
* moved documentation from [wiki](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Monitoring) to [github](https://github.com/jenkinsci/monitoring-plugin/blob/master/README.md)
* added new Prometheus metrics in .../monitoring?format=prometheus: used non-heap memory, used buffered memory, used physical memory, used swap space, loaded classes count (a704562).

#### 1.79.0 (Jul 26, 2019)

* fix [JENKINS-58419](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-58419): No redirect after login in the CAS plugin since 1.78.0.
* fix [JENKINS-58388](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-58388), broken 'report' link in Available and Updated tabs of plugin manager.
* fix [#843](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/843): when using Tomcat, Tomcat info is not available anymore since Tomcat 8.5.35 and Tomcat 9.0.13.
* fix [#847](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/847): When downloading more than 2GB, assertionError may occur.

#### 1.78.0 (Jul 2, 2019)

* Improved the rendering of the management links in the Administer page ([JENKINS-57373](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-57373)).
   Note that the link on "Monitoring of memory, cpu, http requests and more in Jenkins master." goes to the "/monitoring" page.
   And the link on "You can also view the monitoring of builds, build queue and Jenkins nodes." goes to the "/monitoring/nodes" page.
* added: display an alert at the top of the monitoring page when there is an exception while collecting data, in order to make easier to fix basic technical issues in javamelody ([a7a8b26](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/commit/a7a8b26)). For example, `IOException: No space left on device`.
* fix to still flush the response when no content in FilterServletResponseWrapper.flushBuffer() ([#836](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/836))
* added: Czech translations ([2d85a88](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/commit/2d85a88), thanks to *Lukáš Karabec*)
* improved: missing German translations ([c19539b](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/commit/c19539b), thanks to *Michael Dobrovnik*)
* To contribute in your own language, join the translation project at <https://poeditor.com/join/project/QIaCp4bThS>.

#### 1.77.0 (Apr 21, 2019)

* improved: better aggregation of http requests. The javamelody parameter used by default in this plugin is now `-Djavamelody.http-transform-pattern=/\d+/|(?<=/static/|/adjuncts/|/bound/)[\w\-]+|(?<=/ws/|/user/|/testReport/|/javadoc/|/site/|/violations/file/|/cobertura/).+|(?<=/job/).+(?=/descriptorByName/)`.
* added: Italian translations ([ffc028f](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/commit/ffc028f), thanks to *Gianluca Maiorino*)
* added: Ukrainian translations ([073bc6d](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/commit/073bc6d), thanks to *Yevgen Lasman*)
* To contribute in your own language, join the translation project at <https://poeditor.com/join/project/QIaCp4bThS>.
* added: ability to upload heap dump files to [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) ([PR 810](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/pull/810), thanks to *Salah Qasem*).
   To enable the upload of heap dump files to [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/):
  1. add a parameter `heap-dump-s3-bucketname` with the S3 bucket name, in system properties. For example `-Djavamelody.heap-dump-s3-bucketname=mybucket` in your jenkins.xml file. And restart.
  2. Download this [aws-s3-library plugin](https://github.com/javamelody/aws-s3-library/releases/download/1.11.136/aws-s3-library.hpi) and install it with the Advanced tab of the Plugin manager in Jenkins.
  3. You also need to provide AWS credentials and AWS region as AWS as environnement variables or system properties or credentials or config files or Amazon services, see [doc](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/wiki/UserGuideAdvanced#upload-heap-dumps-to-aws-s3) (scroll down if the target page does not scroll to the right chapter).

#### 1.76.0 (Jan 27, 2019)

* You can now contribute translations for javamelody by using a dedicated website at POEditor. You may contribute some "untranslated" labels for German and Portuguese or you may contribute new translations for Spanish, Italian or your own language. Join the translation project at <https://poeditor.com/join/project/QIaCp4bThS>
* fix for Prometheus integration: exclude metrics which have no sense (javamelody\_log\_duration\_millis, javamelody\_log\_errors\_count, javamelody\_error\_errors\_count) and metrics for statistics which are not displayed in the reports ([e1db7c5](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/commit/e1db7c5), [c0f34a2](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/commit/c0f34a2))
* fix [#806](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/806) for Prometheus integration again: it was printed '<?>' instead of NaN, for 'lastValue' on Java 8 and before.

#### 1.75.0 (Dec 9, 2018)

* Fix [#794](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/794) Compatibility with Google App Engine using Java 8.
* Fix [#779](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/779) When using JSVC to launch Tomcat, InternalError: errno: 13 error: Unable to open directory /proc/self/fd
* Enhanced: added X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN in the reports.
* CSRF protection is automatically enabled in the plugin, if CSRF protection is enabled in Jenkins. (Note that a restart is needed if changed in Jenkins.)

Added the Offline viewer tool for some degraded cases:

* If ever you don't have access to the online reports of javamelody on the running server,
* or if you want to view the reports but the server is no longer running,
* then the offline viewer may be for you. See [doc](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/wiki/UserGuideAdvanced#offline-viewer)

#### 1.74.0 (Sep 4, 2018)

* It is a **recommended upgrade for security** to fix a [XML External Entity (XXE) processing](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_%28XXE%29_Processing) vulnerability. CVE-ID is [CVE-2018-15531](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15531). Thanks to *mounsurf & huanying* for reporting the vulnerability. But note that Jenkins uses the Woodstox parser so it is currently safe from this XXE vulnerability.
* Fix warning logs about serializing anonymous classes ([issue 768](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/768)).
* fix: do not require Log4J when sending metrics to [InfluxDB](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/wiki/UserGuideAdvanced#sending-metrics-to-influxdb) or [Datadog](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/wiki/UserGuideAdvanced#sending-metrics-to-datadog).
* added: native calendar widget to choose dates for a custom period ([84a1d63](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/commit/84a1d63321449f71dec6069d3e712ee67e3ef5d6), with help from my colleague Fabien at [KleeGroup](http://www.kleegroup.com))

#### 1.73.1 (Jun 27, 2018)

* Compatibility with JDK 9: `-Djdk.attach.allowAttachSelf=true` is no longer required to have heap histogram and fix the display of source for a JDK class.

#### 1.73.0 (Jun 20, 2018)

* Compatibility with JDK 9: fix heap dump and heap histogram, display again the graphs of cpu, opened files and physical memory. ~~Note: to have the memory histogram in JDK 9 or later, add `-Djdk.attach.allowAttachSelf=true` in the java command line.~~
* Fix "no token found" with Prometheus integration for a Windows server ([e47b11b](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/commit/e47b11bbaf0772151a7cae8ff97227516cd86b04))
* Enhancement: After generating a heap dump, zip it to reduce its size ([98cb8bc](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/commit/98cb8bc08103f2ff00a4f5e72be64ddf278f2656))
* Added: The mean number of allocated Kilobytes per request is now displayed in the stats, next to the mean cpu per request. It is the memory used in the heap per request and which will have to be cleaned by the Garbage Collector later. And when more memory is used per request, more cpu will be used by the GC. As an example, 1 Gb allocated in a request, without a good reason, is probably a problem. ([33fe61d](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/commit/33fe61d5af0dc46a35c1f1a0dc26952651612055))
* Added: when crash logs (hs\_err\_pid\*.log files) are found, display them in the system actions ([5ebb28e](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/commit/5ebb28e9bfe98cacef6c95c9d3b5f338a444efc9))
* Added: in the zoomed charts, display of the [95th percentile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burstable_billing) line. It shows what would be the maximum on the period if 5% of the highest values (short peaks) were excluded ([9f7acba](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/commit/9f7acba4e1d21658be9db2f807a7864787c04e78))
* Fix rare issue: ArithmeticException: / by zero in JRobin RRD files ([JENKINS-51590](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-51590)).
* Removed the `prometheus-include-last-value` javamelody parameter and replaced it by the `includeLastValue` http parameter ([08aacb2](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/commit/08aacb2fdc122a383ad4590c1426b8e129552480), see [doc](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/wiki/UserGuideAdvanced#exposing-metrics-to-prometheus)). So, in the improbable case that you used `prometheus-include-last-value` for Prometheus integration, change your scrape\_config to:

  ```
    params:
      format: ['prometheus']
      includeLastValue: ['true']

  ```

#### 1.72.0 (Apr 4, 2018)

* Fix [#735](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/735): NPE when there are no executors.
* Fix [#737](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/737) for StatsD integration.
* Fix [#731](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/731): When using [CloudWatch](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/wiki/UserGuideAdvanced#sending-metrics-to-aws-cloudwatch), Cloudwatch metric upload can't handle more then 20 items (with help from *marcrelation*).
* Fix [#668](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/668): `RrdException: Invalid timestamps specified` in some particular case when using custom period.

#### 1.71.0 (Feb 5, 2018)

* Added JEP-200 exclusions when using monitoring with slaves (PR [#6](https://github.com/jenkinsci/monitoring-plugin/pull/6) thanks to Jesse Glick)
* Note that Jenkins core includes the monitoring classes in its whitelist for the monitoring plugin 1.68.0 or later, but Jenkins servers using the monitoring plugin 1.67 or older need to upgrade the plugin ([JENKINS-50280](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-50280)).
* Fix [#700](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/700) for Prometheus integration (with help from *Stefan Penndorf*).
* Fix [#701](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/701) for Datadog integration (PR [#702](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/pull/702), thanks to *bluegaspode*).
* Fix [#718](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/718): NPE when displaying the webapp dependencies in some particular case.
* improved: Warn in the reports if multiple instances use the same storage directory ([#692](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/692))
* improved: If the `application-name` parameter is defined, use it when publishing metrics to InfluxDB, Graphite, StatsD, CloudWatch or Datadog instead of the context path ([#694](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/694))
* added: When using the [reports by mail](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/wiki/UserGuide#14-weekly-daily-or-monthly-reports-by-mail), a new javamelody parameter `mail-subject-prefix` can be used to configure the subject of the mail notification. For example, in a Tomcat context file: `<Parameter name='javamelody.mail-subject-prefix' value='Production environment JavaMelody reports for {0}' override='false'/>` (PR [#710](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/pull/710), thanks to *vkpandey82*)
* added: In the [External API](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/wiki/ExternalAPI), the url `monitoring?part=lastValue&format=json` now returns all the last values by names. (The url `monitoring?part=lastValue&graph=usedMemory` already returns the last value of a single graph by name.)

#### 1.70.0 (Oct 29, 2017)

* added: integration with **Prometheus**: Metrics are already displayed in the monitoring reports. You can also scrape the same metrics from [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) at the frequency you wish for advanced visualizations, if you have a Prometheus server installed (PR [#682](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/pull/682) & PR [#684](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/pull/684), thanks to *slynn1324*). See [doc](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/wiki/UserGuideAdvanced#exposing-metrics-to-prometheus).
   Note : If Jenkins security is enabled, the system property `-Djavamelody.plugin-authentication-disabled=true` can be added to the Jenkins server in order to disable authentication of the monitoring page in the Monitoring plugin and to allow Prometheus to scrape metrics.
* added integration with **StatsD**: Metrics are already displayed in the charts of the monitoring reports. As an extra, you can also publish the same metrics to [StatsD](https://github.com/etsy/statsd), if you have a StatsD daemon installed. To enable sending the metrics, add a parameter `statsd-address` with hostname:port of the StatsD daemon, in system properties. For example `-Djavamelody.statsd-address=11.22.33.44:8125` in your jenkins.xml file, see [doc](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/wiki/UserGuideAdvanced#sending-metrics-to-statsd). ([92aeffe](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/commit/92aeffe800194544b9c91c1c799b36e74d4b7436))
* fix [#681](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/681): upgrade prototype.js, effects.js and slider.js

#### 1.69.1 (Sep 20, 2017)

* remove the slf4j-api dependency from the plugin to avoid potential conflicts with the same dependency in jenkins core.

#### 1.69.0 (Aug 27, 2017)

* In the [Jenkins plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Monitoring), fix NPE when using [CloudWatch](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/wiki/UserGuideAdvanced#sending-metrics-to-aws-cloudwatch) or [Graphite](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/wiki/UserGuideAdvanced#sending-metrics-to-graphite) ([3e2b872](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/commit/3e2b8720f90514c000519055635ad0bb5f426531)).
* In the [Jenkins plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Monitoring) with FreeBSD, fix [JENKINS-45963](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-45963): if the collect fails for one slave, continue with the others
* added integration with **InfluxDB**: Metrics are already displayed in the charts of the monitoring reports. Like integrations with [Graphite](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/wiki/UserGuideAdvanced#sending-metrics-to-graphite) and [AWS CloudWatch](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/wiki/UserGuideAdvanced#sending-metrics-to-aws-cloudwatch), you can also publish the same metrics to [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/) for advanced visualizations, if you have an InfluxDB server installed. The parameter is `influxdb-url`, see [doc](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/wiki/UserGuideAdvanced#sending-metrics-to-influxdb). ([f7c8503](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/commit/f7c850361bec907aaba39861e473092043e75cc4))
* added integration with **Datadog**: Like for InfluxDB, you can also publish the same metrics to [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) for advanced visualizations. The parameter is `datadog-api-key`, see [doc](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/wiki/UserGuideAdvanced#sending-metrics-to-datadog). ([239aa4e](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/commit/239aa4e4cdf3c2943caff779a2f5492772f1500f))

#### 1.68.0 (Jul 1, 2017)

* improved (Brazilian) Portuguese translation (PR [#642](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/pull/642), thanks to *Sandro Giacomozzi*).
* added a **monitoring script** to display stats of builds and build steps having a mean time greater than the severe threshold. See [the script](https://github.com/jenkinsci/monitoring-plugin/blob/master/docs/MonitoringScripts.md#display-some-mbean-attribute-value).
* fix [#638](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/638): When using [scripts and alerts](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/wiki/ScriptsAndAlerts) to monitor an application, ClassNotFoundException in Jenkins if the monitored webapp is using Ehcache or Quartz jobs.
* Internal classes moved: Many internal classes, which were not public and all in the `net.bull.javamelody` package, are now moved to `net.bull.javamelody.internal.*` packages.
* added: In the list of threads, add an action to send an interrupt signal to a thread. The thread can test Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted() to stop itself. ([7977f2b](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/commit/7977f2b98020aebbc254d1e19138782bed882d73))
* added: PDF link in the threads page ([b356132](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/commit/b356132e06047fdae09fd63f5212464e7da9efe9))
* added integration with **Graphite**: Metrics are already displayed in the charts of the monitoring reports. As an extra, you can also publish the same metrics to [Graphite](https://graphiteapp.org/) for advanced visualizations, if you have a Graphite server installed. Metrics will be sent once per minute (default value of the resolution-seconds parameter) and Graphite will allow custom visualizations in itself or in [Grafana](http://grafana.org/). The names of metrics in Graphite are like `javamelody.appContext.hostName.metricName`, so you will be able to aggregate a metric using wildcards.
   To enable sending the metrics, add a parameter `graphite-address` with hostname:port of the Graphite server, in system properties. For example `-Djavamelody.graphite-address=11.22.33.44:2003` in your jenkins.xml file. ([ce94787](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/commit/ce947870ed120589c49b2e080ea7be17f8ef07b0))
* added integration with **AWS CloudWatch**: Like for Graphite, you can also publish the same metrics to [AWS CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) for custom visualizations and mail or autoscaling alarms, if you have AWS EC2 server instance(s) with [detailed monitoring](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-cloudwatch-new.html) in AWS CloudWatch. Metrics will be sent once per minute (default value of the resolution-seconds parameter) and CloudWatch will allow [custom visualizations and mail or auto-scaling alarms](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_concepts.html). The names of metrics in CloudWatch are like `javamelody.metricName`. Metrics also include `application` and `hostname` as dimensions, so you will be able to filter metrics based on those dimensions. Note that there is a [pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/) for CloudWatch metrics (it is supposed that about 25 custom metrics should mean about $10 per month per EC2 instance). ([e65d605](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/commit/e65d6054acec4b1126a212b9ec4605c020c7186a))
   To enable sending the metrics:
  1. add a parameter `cloudwatch-namespace` with the CloudWatch namespace, in system properties. For example `-Djavamelody.cloudwatch-namespace=MyCompany/MyAppDomain` in your jenkins.xml file (the namespaces starting with `AWS/` are reserved for AWS products). And restart.
  2. Download this [aws-cloudwatch-library plugin](https://github.com/javamelody/aws-cloudwatch-library/releases/download/1.11.136/aws-cloudwatch-library.hpi) and install it with the Advanced tab of the Plugin manager in Jenkins.
  3. You also need to provide AWS credentials and AWS region as AWS as environnement variables or system properties or credentials or config files or Amazon services, see [doc](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/wiki/UserGuideAdvanced#sending-metrics-to-aws-cloudwatch).

#### 1.67.0 (May 12, 2017)

* fix [JENKINS-44241](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-44241): **[Real User Monitoring (RUM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_user_monitoring)** in v1.66.0 does not work when enabled, for URLs ending with '/'.

#### 1.66.0 (May 12, 2017)

* fix [#617](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/617): Charts of http/sql stats can not be viewed after restarting the application (with help from *goldyliang*).
* added: Display the number of http sessions and sessions mean size before the list of sessions, when there are more than 20 (PR [#629](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/pull/629), thanks to *Aleksandr Mashchenko*).
* improved: When displaying Java sources from stack-traces, locate more sources by reading Maven pom.xml of Jenkins and of the other dependencies.
* added: Display **webapp dependencies** in a new page, accessed by a link in the System informations details, and include detailed name, website url, Maven [groupId:artifactId:version](http://groupIdartifactIdversion) and license of each dependency, based on Maven pom.xml files. ([e7607c1](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/commit/e7607c19087d6b592c92c38b50b5e2fd1d9fd306))
* added: The version of Jenkins is displayed at the top of the report and a drop-down list of versions next to "Customized" period allows to display the report for the period of each version deployed, to compare between them for example. ([d61e65f](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/commit/d61e65f82c936e5dc986e4f850d4a5998b9caa2d), based on an idea by *dhartford*).
* added: **[Real User Monitoring (RUM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_user_monitoring)**. It allows to measure the experience from the end user perspective, by monitoring times in the browser for each html page until it is displayed and ready to be used ([b85652a](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/commit/b85652a182d05517ad8151f4101d584ecc007517)).
* The Real User Monitoring works by injecting on the fly a [Boomerang](https://soasta.github.io/boomerang/doc/) javascript at the end of html pages, just before the `</body>` end tag, which sends data back to the monitoring in your server. Then in the detailed monitoring report of http requests for html pages, times and percentages are displayed for Network, Server execution, DOM processing and Page rendering, to compare which ones contribute to a good or bad end user experience. The Real User Monitoring does not add a noticeable overhead on the server, but the javascript adds a simple http(s) call for each html page, which may add a small overhead on the client browser.
* This Real User Monitoring is **not enabled by default**. To enable it, add the system property "-Djavamelody.rum-enabled=true" in your jenkins.xml file.

#### 1.65.1 (Mar 13, 2017)

* added: configuration to list Jenkins maven public repository next to ~/.m2/repository and Maven central, to be able to display Jenkins and plugins sources from stack-traces.

#### 1.65.0 (Mar 12, 2017)

* fix [JENKINS-42112](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-42112), HTTP user session is reported as "anonymous" when using anything but AbstractPasswordBasedSecurityRealm (like Google login plugin or Cloudbees Operations Center).
* fix compatibility with Java 9. (PR [#609](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/pull/609) for issue [#556](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/556), thanks to *James Pether Sörling*)
* improved: make easier the selection of the stack-trace text in the tooltips of the threads list ([736cf0e](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/commit/736cf0ed88f81e8e4c0ef92b6151cfe62119bc17))
* added: pdf report in the detail page of a request. ([28e2474](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/commit/28e24742c6a2a9838ce1aaf34acb152b031e6497))
* added: links to view java source from errors and threads stack-traces. ([e5263bf](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/commit/e5263bf08e36ab7be35c639ba7e2899d4c0ced5d))

* Source from the JDK and source from artifacts built by Maven and available in Maven central can be viewed. So if your server uses a JRE and not a JDK, source from the JDK are not available. And note that many artifacts available in Maven central were not built by Maven, for example Tomcat libraries, so sources of those artifacts can't be located.
* added: if the javamelody parameter -Djavamelody.jmx-expose-enabled=true is set (in the jenkins.xml file), then javamelody mbeans are available with aggregated statistics data about requests. The javamelody mbeans can be read with the MBeans screen in 'System actions' of the monitoring report (<http://jenkinsserver:8080/monitoring?part=mbeans>) or using JMX with the JConsole of the JDK. (PR [#591](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/pull/591) thanks to *Alexey Pushkin*)

* doc added: [Summary of javamelody parameters](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/wiki/Parameters) to extend the [javamelody user's guide](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/wiki/UserGuide).

~~1.64.0~~

#### 1.63.0 (Jan 16, 2017)

* added: check for updated version of javamelody. If a new version is available, a message is now displayed at the top of the report to notify about the new version. For that, javamelody pings the server javamelody.org. And to better understand javamelody users, anonymous data such as java version and OS is sent to that server at the same time. An example of the data sent is: `uniqueId="3d117c04b914c78ddbaf14818c404c8e88c6e56f", serverInfo="jetty/9.2.z-SNAPSHOT", javamelodyVersion="1.63.0", applicationType="Jenkins", javaVersion="Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment, 1.8.0_111-b14", jvmVersion="Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, 25.111-b14, mixed mode", maxMemory="1024", availableProcessors="4", os="Windows 7, Service Pack 1, amd64/64", databases="", countersUsed="http|error|log", parametersUsed="log", featuresUsed="pdf", locale="fr_FR", usersMean=1, collectorApplications=-1`.
* Usage stats based on the anonymous data will be publicly available at <http://javamelody.org/usage/stats> for applications using JavaMelody v1.63 or later (including Jenkins using the Monitoring plugin) and able to contact the server.
* You may disable the update check with the javamelody parameter "update-check-disabled=true" in system properties. If you want to, add the system property "-Djavamelody.update-check-disabled=true" in the jenkins.xml file.
* The online demo of javamelody is finally back. To see it, you can play a bit with [this app](http://javamelody.org/demo/) (written by Benjamin Durand some years ago) to be sure to have some data in http and sql statistics, then open the [monitoring page](http://javamelody.org/demo/monitoring) to explore the reports.

* improved: [JENKINS-34736](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-34736) Migrate to 2.9 parent pom (thanks to *Armando Fernández*)
* added system property "csrf-protection-enabled" to enable protection against [CSRF](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_%28CSRF%29) on actions such as run GC, invalidate sessions, kill thread by id ... (Not enabled by default since an attacker would need to know about javamelody in Jenkins and about its URLs and would need to force an administrator to access the monitoring and even in this case, the attacker certainly can't make Jenkins unvailable and can't steal data or anything.) To enable this protection, add the system property "-Djavamelody.csrf-protection-enabled=true" in the jenkins.xml file.
* Limit error messages to 1000 characters and error stack-traces to 50000 characters, to avoid high memory consumption when log messages are very long ([PR 550](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/pull/550), thanks to *Zdenek Henek*)

#### 1.59.0 (Feb 25, 2016)

* fix username in the list of http sessions ([d111126](https://github.com/jenkinsci/monitoring-plugin/commit/d1111261b03f7762e903724599fbf84eaa3a2d48))
* fix [issue 533](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/533): IllegalArgumentException during metrics update ([JENKINS-33050](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-33050))
* fix [issue 532](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/532): do not flush a closed output stream.
* improved: wrap very long http queries without whitespace, in order to fit into the screen and to avoid horizontal scrollbar ([3a88a75](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/commit/3a88a75a9554b6496ff6b224716c6ed840bd88b1))

* added: Support Log4J 2 since v2.4.1 like Log4J ([068139d](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/commit/068139d70dd65ff7574c5ec3cb15045af2f33d9f))
* added: Show used memory in dialog after manual GC ([issue 522](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/522))

#### 1.58.0 (Nov 26, 2015)

* fix [JENKINS-23442](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-23442), ClassCircularityError: java/util/logging/LogRecord ([0ad60da](https://github.com/jenkinsci/monitoring-plugin/commit/0ad60da0038048ca69672022e54434cb3c5c87a3))
* **Upgraded mininum Jenkins** version to 1.580.1
* replace use of deprecated Jenkins api
* fix from [PR 505](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/pull/505) and PR [507](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/pull/507): German translations (thanks to *mawulf*)
* fix [issue 492](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/492): incompatibility of the release v1.57.0 (isAsyncStarted) with servlet api 2.5 (when using mvn hpi:run in development).
* added: 2 new graphs are displayed in "Other charts", below the main charts: "% System CPU" and "Used buffered memory" ([5029404](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/commit/5029404eeb24e7b5c657453d06e9fc603fa5eb0d)).
  + **% System CPU** is the CPU usage for the whole system (not just the JVM), between 0 and 100%.
  + **Used buffered memory** is the memory used, either by *direct buffers* allocated outside of the garbage-collected heap, using [ByteBuffer.allocateDirect](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/ByteBuffer.html#allocateDirect%28int%29), or by *mapped buffers* created by mapping a region of a file into memory, using [FileChannel.map](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/channels/FileChannel.html#map%28java.nio.channels.FileChannel.MapMode,%20long,%20long%29).

#### 1.57.0 (Aug 31, 2015)

* fix: used/max file descriptor counts are not displayed in oracle java 8 ([c04ef79](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/commit/c04ef7925977f17566581b81909bb62780b947e9) thanks to *Colin Ingarfield*)
* Jenkins plugin: scripts examples updated to get data from slaves in [Jenkins Monitoring Scripts](https://github.com/jenkinsci/monitoring-plugin/blob/master/docs/MonitoringScripts.md), below the scripts for Jenkins master.
* improved: An [api page](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/blob/master/javamelody-core/src/main/resources/net/bull/javamelody/resource/help/api.html) is now available in the monitoring with links to the [ExternalAPI](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/wiki/ExternalAPI). The path of the page in your Jenkins is "monitoring?resource=help/api.html".
* added: it's now easy to write scripts to get monitoring data from a monitored webapp and to send alerts based on thresholds, using Jenkins for Continuous Monitoring. See the [documentation](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/wiki/ScriptsAndAlerts).

#### JavaMelody migration to Github

* The JavaMelody project is migrated from GoogleCode (<https://code.google.com/p/javamelody>) to GitHub. The new project home page is: <https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/wiki>
* The monitoring plugin for Jenkins does not move and is at <https://github.com/jenkinsci/monitoring-plugin>

#### 1.55.0 (Jan 30, 2015)

* fix [issue 453](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/453): Chinese translation for heap dump (thanks to *chuxuebao*)
* fix [issue 436](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/436): implement Servlet 3.1 new methods (JavaEE 7), in FilterServletOutputStream and others
* fix [issue 455](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/455): HTTP-401 / WWW-Authenticate wrongly reported as HTTP error

#### 1.54.0 (Now 30, 2014)

* fix: Monitoring reports of a slave didn't work if its name contains a space.
* fix [issue 440](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/440): Not able to start Desktop version.

#### 1.53.1 (Oct 3, 2014)

* fix: in v1.52.0 with Tomcat, graphs of bytes received/sent and of Tomcat active threads were not displayed anymore in "Other charts" ([revision 3908](https://code.google.com/p/javamelody/source/detail?r=3908)).
* fix [issue 439](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/439): Display Linux version in "System informations", and not "Linux unknown"
* improved: Portuguese translation ([revision 3885](https://code.google.com/p/javamelody/source/detail?r=3885), thanks to *Fernando Boaglio*)
* added: new system property "javamelody.sampling-included-packages" for a white list in [cpu hotspots](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/wiki/UserGuideAdvanced#enable-hotspots-detection), instead of using the "javamelody.sampling-excluded-packages" system property ([issue 424](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/424), thanks to *alf.hogemark*)

#### 1.53.0 (Oct 1, 2014)

* fix security issues. See [Jenkins security advisory](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/SECURITY/Jenkins%2BSecurity%2BAdvisory%2B2014-10-01).

#### 1.52.1 (Aug 6, 2014)

* fix: for Maven type jobs on recent Jenkins versions, builds of Maven modules are displayed as always running in the /monitoring/nodes page
* fix: the logout action in the menu did not work in the /monitoring/nodes page

#### 1.52.0 (Aug 3, 2014)

* **Upgraded mininum Jenkins** version to 1.509.3
* added: display of **build steps** and their durations, in the detail of each build statistics in the "/monitoring/nodes" page. Example:

* added: The system property "javamelody.nodes-monitoring-disabled" can be used to disable the periodic monitoring of slaves. Either at startup, for example "-Djavamelody.nodes-monitoring-disabled=true" in the jenkins.xml file, or even at runtime. **Disabling periodic monitoring of slaves** can help against issues, if there are Jenkins slaves and if the communication with slaves is too unstable in the Jenkins remoting.
* improved: reduce the number of RRD files created in some conditions, by not creating a RRD file of mean times if a request is called only once ([revision 3836](https://code.google.com/p/javamelody/source/detail?r=3836)). Otherwise, obsolete RRD files are automatically deleted after 3 months like before.
* added: links "View in a new page" below the tables of threads and of current requests ([revision 3839](https://code.google.com/p/javamelody/source/detail?r=3839)). For example when Jenkins is under load, the new pages make it easy to refresh at will the details of threads or of the current requests to see if states change or not, without refreshing all the main page.
* added: logout action in the menu on the right of the main report ([revision 3859](https://code.google.com/p/javamelody/source/detail?r=3859))
* fixed [JENKINS-21357](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-21357) Node monitoring action: Use the specific computer's sidepanel instead of Jenkins default page. But the actions on the left sidepanel may be broken because of [JENKINS-23963](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-23963).

#### 1.51.0 (Jun 5, 2014)

* fix: when using java 8, cpu graph was not displayed
* Drop Java 5 support ([revision 3795](https://code.google.com/p/javamelody/source/detail?r=3795))
* Optimized desktop UI startup time, by downloading desktop app and caching locally ([revision 3762](https://code.google.com/p/javamelody/source/detail?r=3762))
* improved: in a graph detail, a checkbox can now hide maximum values in the graph, so that average values are better displayed when much lower than the maximum ([issue 368](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/368))
* added: PID in the heap dump file name ([revision 3773](https://code.google.com/p/javamelody/source/detail?r=3773))

#### 1.50.0 (Mar 27, 2014)

* Fix icons and links on some Jenkins servers in the new Monitoring page of individual nodes ([JENKINS-20935](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-20935))
* fix issue [issue 370](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/370): work around ConcurrentModificationException during Tomcat startup (which is a [Tomcat bug](https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56082))
* fix issue [issue 386](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/386): IllegalArgumentException: No enum const class ..., in Turkish
* improved: In the US, depending on the browser's language or on the javamelody parameter "locale", the paper size is now Letter in the US, instead of A4 like in the other countries. ([revision 3679](https://code.google.com/p/javamelody/source/detail?r=3679), thanks to *Dennis*)
* improved css styles: font finally fixed to Arial/Helvetica ([revision 3718](https://code.google.com/p/javamelody/source/detail?r=3718)).
* added: **Menu**. A floating button is available on the right of the main report to drag a menu in or out. The menu displays the list of chapters in the report and allows to jump easily between them ([revision 3705](https://code.google.com/p/javamelody/source/detail?r=3705)).
* added: **Custom reports**. Links to custom reports can be included in the floating menu described above.
   For that, add a system property named "javamelody.custom-reports". In the value of this system property, put the list of names of the custom reports separated with commas. Then for each custom report, add a system property with the same name and its path as value. By default, the following properties are already defined:
   -Djavamelody.custom-reports=JenkinsInfo,AboutMonitoring
   -Djavamelody.JenkinsInfo=/systemInfo
   -Djavamelody.AboutMonitoring=<https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Monitoring>

#### 1.49.0 (Jan 12, 2014)

* added: For each individual node (each slave in <http://yourhost/computer>), reports and actions are available from the "Monitoring" page in the contextual menu or in the detail of the node:
  + Threads, process list, MBeans of that node only
  + Heap histogram of that node
  + Actions for GC, heap dump
  + ([JENKINS-20935](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-20935), with help from Oleg Nenashev)
* improved: When I call the "Invalidate http sessions" action, invalidate all sessions except mine (I can still invalidate my session individually after that)
* improved: In the list of http sessions, a bullet shows which one is my own session, if I have a session
* improved css styles with the come back of shadows in Firefox and with hovers for images, ~\_(see) \_([JavaMelody\ Demo](https://code.google.com/p/javamelody/wiki/Demo))~ ([revision 3614](https://code.google.com/p/javamelody/source/detail?r=3614))

#### 1.48.0 (Nov 20, 2013)

* fix [JENKINS-20352](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-20532): HTTP session count is high, since Jenkins v1.535 ([revision 3569](https://code.google.com/p/javamelody/source/detail?r=3569))
* fix [issue 354](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/354): With the java update 1.7\_u45, the Desktop app does not start

#### 1.47.0 (Sep 29, 2013)

* fix [issue 339](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/339): "One day" memory leak
* fix [issue 346](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/346): XSS through X-Forwarded-For header spoofing
* fix [issue 232](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/232): Use the path of -XX:HeapDumpPath=/tmp if defined, for the directory of heap dump files (otherwise use the temp directory of the server as before)
* added: detection of cpu hotspots can be enabled ([issue 149](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/149), with some ideas from Cédric Lime).
  + In the monitoring reports, the new Hotspots screen displays CPU hotspots in executed methods for all the JVM. Like javamelody, the overhead of hotspots is low: it is based on sampling of stack-traces of threads, without instrumentation. And like javamelody, it is made to be always active if enabled. (It is currently not enabled by default. It may be enabled by default in the future.) Two parameters can be defined as system properties in the jenkins.xml file:
  + "javamelody.sampling-seconds" to enable the sampling and to define its period. A period of 10 seconds can be recommended to have the lowest overhead, but then a few hours may be needed to have significant results for a webapp under real use. If you don't mind having a bit more overhead or want a result faster in test, you can use a value of 1 or 0.1 in second for this parameter.
  + "javamelody.sampling-excluded-packages" to change the list of the excluded packages ("java,sun,com.sun,javax,org.apache,org.hibernate,oracle,org.postgresql,org.eclipse" by default)

#### 1.46.0 (Aug 4, 2013)

* fix [JENKINS-17757](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-17757) IllegalStateException: Timer already cancelled from NodesCollector.scheduleCollectNow
* use a timeout for the monitoring of slaves, when a slave is online but does not respond
* fix NPE when manually purging the obsolete monitoring files of slaves

#### 1.45.0 (Jun 6, 2013)

* added: button to kill a thread from the current requests (issue [issue 302](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/302))
* added: button to donate in the html reports, to better inform users of this possibility

#### 1.44.0 (Mar 30, 2013)

* fix: it is currently useless to display the sql hits for the current requests
* fix: better aggregation of http requests in the statistics, for URLs /adjuncts/... and /$stapler/bound/... (also reduces the disk space used to store data)
* fix [issue 289](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/289), [JENKINS-15529](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-15529): NoClassDefFoundError: com/sun/management/OperatingSystemMXBean, in JBoss AS 7 without configuration of modules
* page added: Some can be executed using the Jenkins Script Console.

#### 1.43.0 (Jan 27, 2013)

* fix [issue 270](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/270): French Canadians can't choose a customized period
* fix: in the current requests, use the chosen period to display the statistics of mean times, besides the elapsed times
* added: PDF report of the current requests
* added: optional parameter "locale" to fix the locale of the reports, whatever the language in the browser ([issue 271](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/271), thanks to *xiukongtiao*). You can add, for example, the system property -Djavamelody.locale=en\_US

#### 1.42.0 (Dec 2, 2012)

* fix [issue 262](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/262) NullPointerException in MonitoringFilter.doFilter(), when the webapp is undeployed and after a timeout
* added: New alternative User Interface for the monitoring reports with a **Rich Desktop Application**. Highlights :
  + All reports and data like in the web UI
  + Exports to PDF, XML and JSON formats, even if the monitored application does not have the dependencies to do the same in the web UI
  + Tabs to view different reports
  + Columns of tables may be sorted, resized and moved
  + Exports with right-click for all tabular data to CSV, PDF, RTF, HTML, XML, JSON formats
  + Shortcuts, such as F5
  + Started in one-click with the "Desktop" link at the top of the web UI. The required libraries are downloaded automatically from ~\_(googlecode)~ github on the first launch.
  + Uses JavaWebStart and requires [JRE 1.7](http://java.com) on the client
  + This new UI may be an alternative to the web UI for advanced users or for exports

#### 1.41.0 (Sep 30, 2012)

* fix [issue 252](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/252) Add XSS protection
* fix [issue 255](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/issues/255) exception while collecting data java.io.FileNotFoundException: Could not open ....rrd existent

#### 1.40.0 (Aug 26, 2012)

* fix [issue 14050](http://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-14050), also for the monitoring reports of Nodes.
* added in the external API: XML and JSON exports of MBeans, and of JNDI tree given a JNDI context path. Documentation is [here](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/wiki/ExternalAPI#xml). For example: [MBeans](http://demo.javamelody.cloudbees.net/monitoring?format=xml&part=mbeans) and [JNDI](http://demo.javamelody.cloudbees.net/monitoring?format=json&part=jndi&path=comp).

#### 1.39.0 (Jun 21, 2012)

* fix [issue 14050](http://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-14050), also when security is enabled in Jenkins: Unreadable HTML response for the monitoring reports. Compression of the monitoring reports is now disabled in the plugin and the reports will be compressed by Jenkins starting with v1.470.

#### 1.38.0 (Jun 17, 2012)

* fix [issue 14050](http://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-14050), but only when security is not enabled in Jenkins: Unreadable HTML response for the monitoring reports

* fix issue 207: Incompatibility with servlet api 2.4 (Tomcat 5.5) in Monitoring plugin 1.36.0
* added: Reduce the possibility of storage overload by deleting automatically the obsolete RRD files (which were not updated for the last 3 months), and which were for requests which do not exist anymore. Note: the size of existing RRD files is fixed for ever and old .ser.gz files are already automatically deleted after a year.
* added: Display the disk usage of the storage at the bottom of the report

#### 1.36.0 (Mar 30, 2012)

* [JavaMelody](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/wiki) is used inside the Monitoring plugin. Thanks to [CloudBees](http://www.cloudbees.com) Jenkins CI, [nightly build](https://javamelody.ci.cloudbees.com/job/javamelody/), [javadoc](https://javamelody.ci.cloudbees.com/job/javamelody/site/apidocs/index.html) and [sources](https://javamelody.ci.cloudbees.com/job/javamelody/site/xref/index.html) of JavaMelody are available.
   ~*(And\ there\ is\ a\ public\ demo\ of\ JavaMelody.\ It\ is\ based\ on\ the\ latest\ source\ in\ trunk\ and\ is\ continuously\ deployed.\ It\ is\ currently\ not\ a\ demo\ in\ Jenkins,\ but\ instead\ in\ an\ application\ with\ GWT,\ services\ and\ SQL.)~
   ~*(First,\ you\ can\ play\ with\ this\ quick\ and\ dirty) \_([GWT\ application](http://demo.javamelody.cloudbees.net/)) *(to\ have\ some\ data\ (thanks\ Benjamin))~
   ~*(Then\ you\ can\ view\ the\ charts\ and\ the\ statistics\ in\ the) \_([monitoring\ reports](http://demo.javamelody.cloudbees.net/monitoring)) \_((no\ password))~

* Other notes:
  + fix blocking issue 194: The jrobin v1.5.9 artifacts are now available in the Maven central repository as you can see [here](http://search.maven.org/). The external (and currently unreachable) repository in the javamelody pom is now useless and removed.
  + fix issue 201: Unable to render MBeans tree when some JMX-retrieval exception occurs
     added: if there are deadlocked threads in the JVM, print a warning message with the names of the deadlocked threads at the top of threads dump, like in the html and pdf reports (revision 2678)
  + This version requires a Servlet 2.5 container (fixed in 1.37.0)

#### 1.35.0 (Feb 28, 2012)

* fix issue 178: Since v1.32, "Nb of http sessions" is 0 and "View http sessions" is always empty.
* added: graphic of "Build queue length" in the monitoring of nodes, next to the graphic of "Running builds" (done in Jenkins Hackathon, with help from Kohsuke Kawaguchi)
* added: optional parameter (-Djavamelody.dns-lookups-disabled=true) to allow disabling of dns lookups with InetAddress.getLocalHost() to prevent long hangs on startup/shutdown in some particular environments (issue 181, thanks to r6squeegee)

* added: **Portuguese Brazil translation**, including the online help, thanks to *Luiz Gonzaga da Mata* and *Renan Oliveira da Cunha*. This translation is the default for all Portuguese people. The first language in the browser settings should be Portuguese (pt) or Portuguese/Brazil (pt-br) to use it. The [online help in Portuguese Brazil](https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/blob/master/javamelody-core/src/site/resources/Ajuda_on-line_do_monitoring.pdf) is also available.
* added: in the nodes report, chart of the number of the running builds by period

#### 1.25.0

#### 1.24.0

* fix issue 74: "View OS Processes" does not work on MAC OS X Server

* added: In the system actions, new view "MBeans" with the values and the descriptions of the attributes. (MBeans contain configuration and low-level data on the application server and on the JVM). The values are viewable but not writable and operations can not be performed.

* added: Monitoring of the **Jenkins nodes** (slaves in general) similar to the monitoring of the Jenkins master.

  If the monitoring of the Jenkins master is available at <http://localhost:8080/monitoring> then the monitoring of the Jenkins nodes is available at <http://localhost:8080/monitoring/nodes>.

  The monitoring of the Jenkins nodes includes:

  + Aggregated "used memory" chart, aggregated "% cpu" chart (between 0 and 100) for day, week, month, year or a custom period.
  + Chart of the build times over time for the selected period
  + Other aggregated charts: % GC, threads count, loaded classes count, system load average, open file descriptors count and more for the selected period
  + Statistics of the build times for the selected period
  + Running builds with time elapsed
  + Threads informations for each node including name, state, stack-trace and an action to kill any thread
  + Heap histogram aggregated for all nodes
  + Current system informations for each node
  + MBeans for each node
  + Last values in charts and MBeans values. For example, the following URLs can be used: 1 and 2 (the plugin-authentication-disabled parameter could be used)
  + Process informations for each node
  + Actions to execute the GC or to generate a heap dump on each node

* Due to the current infrastructure changes for the [maven2-repository in java.net](https://maven2-repository.dev.java.net/), the "Monitoring" plugin 1.24.0 was not in the plugin manager.

#### 1.23.0

* fix [issue 66](http://code.google.com/p/javamelody/issues/detail?id=66): Since tomcat 6.0.21 and when tomcat based authentication is used, session count is false and there is a possible memory leak for invalidated http sessions in v1.22.0. This is because of the changes for tomcat enhancement [45255](https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=45255). To tomcat experts: Isn't an http session supposed to die first before being able to born a second time?

#### 1.22.0

* fix: Maximum values in statistics could be incorrect
* added major feature: graphic of the number of sessions and details on http sessions with the link in "System informations" (this is emulated without httpsessionlistener, because httpsessionlistener can't be used in Jenkins plugins)
* added: If Jenkins security is enabled, the system property -Djavamelody.plugin-authentication-disabled=true can be added to a Jenkins server in order to disable authentication of the monitoring page in the Monitoring plugin and to be able to add the server to a javamelody centralized collect server. (A system property like -Djavamelody.allowed-addr-pattern=127\.0\.0\.1 can also be added with the ip address of the collect server)

#### 1.21.0

* fix to display the list of http sessions when Tomcat throws an exception "Session already invalidated"
* fix to display the list of process when using Windows in Germany
* added: If Tomcat or JBoss, new graphics in "Other charts" for the number of active http and ajp threads in the server, the number of bytes received per minute and the number of bytes sent per minute by the server.

#### 1.20.0

* added: German translation thanks to Ewald Arnold. We would like to have [feedback here](http://groups.google.fr/group/javamelody/browse_thread/thread/5656e63513436b64).
* fix: In the html display of the current requests, put back the complete http request with query parameters and values, like it was displayed before v1.17.0

#### 1.19.0

* fix NumberFormatException requesting process information.
* fix (removed) jndi link in Winstone.
* added debugging logs.

#### 1.18.0

* other minor bugs fixed.

#### 1.17.0

* some minor bugs fixed.

#### 1.15.1

* change to **reduce disk usage**: Some common http requests are now aggregated in statistics, for example on build numbers.

The `javamelody.http-transform-pattern` parameter has now the default value of

/\d+/|/site/.+|avadoc/.+|/ws/.+|obertura/.+|estReport/.+|iolations/file/.+|/user/.+|/static/\w+/

and all matches in http URLs will be replaced by "$". Note that it is possible on each Jenkins server to change the value of this parameter with a system property `-Djavamelody.http-transform-pattern=xxx` in the java command line.

#### 1.15.0

* change to reduce disk usage: Graphics in http errors and in errors logs are no longer displayed

#### 1.14.0

* fix: There was an InternalError on ubuntu or debian using the tomcat package with jsvc

#### 1.13.0

* added: remember the last selected period (with a persistent cookie in the browser)
* added: UI option to display graphs and statistics for **custom periods**, via fields of start and end dates of period to display

#### 1.12.0

* added: **New charts** "Threads count", "Loaded classes count", "Used non heap memory", "Used physical memory", "Used swap space" (displayed with the new link "Other charts")
* added: Button to kill a java thread
* added: parameters can now be specified in environment variables like in system properties or webapp context
* added: new parameter "monitoring-path" to change the url "/monitoring" of the report to "/admin/monitoring" for example
* added: new parameter "mail-periods" to change the period of mail reports from weekly to daily or monthly or a combination of the 3
* added: display the version of JavaMelody at the bottom of the html and pdf reports
* added: display of "ajax GET" or "ajax POST" in http requests names for ajax requests

#### 1.10.0

* English: For people outside US, UK and France, default language is now the default locale of the server or English.

#### 1.9.0

* Fix: The "Monitoring" link in "/manage" page did not work when Jenkins was in a servlet context (not in the root context of the server).
* JavaMelody fix: someone had an exception in report on Solaris 10 (getPID)

#### 1.8.2

* Removed jdbc graphs as there is no database in Jenkins,
* Removed sessions graph, values and links as the javamelody SessionListener can't be registered without modifying web.xml
* Added a link in "/manage" page
* Added checkPermission to check authentication if configured

#### 1.8.1

* Initial
