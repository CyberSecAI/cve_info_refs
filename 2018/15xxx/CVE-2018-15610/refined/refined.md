Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A flaw exists in the Avaya one-X Portal for IP Office. This flaw is triggered by "specially crafted messages."

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability allows for information disclosure. This suggests a weakness in how the application handles or processes specific types of messages.
- The nature of the "specially crafted messages" is not specified, meaning more specific vulnerability details aren't directly provided within the document.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can achieve information disclosure.
- There's also a potential for high impact on confidentiality and availability based on the CVSS score.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable (AV:N).
- Exploitation requires a network connection to the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have low privileges/access (PR:L). This is not explicitely mentioned in the description text but is shown in the CVSS score vector.
- User interaction is required (UI:R). This could involve getting a user to click a link or interact with malicious content.
