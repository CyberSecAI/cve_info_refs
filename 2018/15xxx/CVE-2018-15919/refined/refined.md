Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-15919

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `auth2-gss.c` file of OpenSSH.  Specifically, the `userauth_gssapi()` function incorrectly handles the authentication flow related to GSSAPI. The vulnerability stems from the fact that the server sends a `SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_GSSAPI_RESPONSE` packet back to the attacker if the first step of the GSSAPI authentication succeeds, indicating a valid username. Conversely, if the first step of GSSAPI authentication fails, the server sends an `SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_FAILURE` packet. However, the server also sets a flag `server_caused_failure` in the case of failure, but only if a valid user is provided, which changes the behavior of `userauth_finish` function, making username enumeration possible.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Username Enumeration:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to distinguish between valid and invalid usernames.  This is because the server increments an authentication failure counter when an invalid username is provided, which leads to the connection being dropped after a number of failed attempts (default 6). A valid username, in contrast, does not increment the failure counter, and the connection is not dropped after multiple tries.
- **Inconsistent Handling of Authentication Failure:** The server logic for handling GSSAPI authentication failures is inconsistent, particularly around the setting of the  `server_caused_failure` flag and its subsequent effect on the `userauth_finish()` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The main impact is user enumeration, which provides attackers with a list of valid usernames on a target system.
- **Precursor to Other Attacks:** Knowing valid usernames can significantly aid attackers in subsequent password guessing or brute-force attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted SSH packets over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must have network access to the target system's SSH service.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to provide valid credentials for the initial exploit, only a username.
- **Understanding of SSH and GSSAPI:**  The attacker needs to understand the SSH protocol and how GSSAPI authentication works in order to craft the necessary packets.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects OpenSSH versions from 5.9 (released September 6, 2011) to 7.8 (released August 24, 2018), inclusive.
- A proof-of-concept patch was provided in the original report which modifies the client code to exploit this flaw.
- NetApp products that are affected by this vulnerability include Cluster Network Switch (NetApp CN1610), Data ONTAP Edge, NetApp Cloud Backup (formerly AltaVault), and NetApp SteelStore Cloud Integrated Storage.
- NetApp has classified this vulnerability as having a MEDIUM severity, with a CVSS v3 base score of 5.3, and a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
- NetApp has indicated that there is no fix planned for this vulnerability for the affected products, which have reached End-of-Availability (EOA).

This vulnerability is more about information leakage than a direct compromise of system access but should be considered a useful tool for attacker in an attack chain.
