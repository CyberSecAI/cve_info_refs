Based on the information provided, the content relates to CVE-2018-15588. The provided resources discuss signature forgery attacks in email clients, stemming from weaknesses in how OpenPGP and S/MIME signatures are verified.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant details:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from weaknesses in the implementation of OpenPGP and S/MIME signature verification in various email clients, rather than in the underlying cryptographic primitives of the signature standards themselves.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

The identified weaknesses fall into several attack classes:

1.  **CMS attacks:** Flaws in handling emails with contradicting or unusual data structures within the S/MIME's container format.
2.  **GPG API attacks:** Vulnerabilities in the GnuPG API command line interface for signature validation, allowing injection attacks.
3.  **MIME attacks:** Exploiting the handling of MIME trees in emails to trick clients into displaying unsigned content while verifying unrelated signatures.
4.  **ID attacks:** Displaying valid signatures from trusted identities while the email is actually signed by an attacker.
5.  **UI attacks:** Mimicking UI elements to mislead users about the validity of signatures.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation allows for spoofing digital signatures on arbitrary messages. An attacker can create emails that appear to be legitimately signed when they are not, potentially leading to phishing attacks, misinformation, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Crafting emails with specific characteristics depending on the attack class such as:

    *   Contradicting/unusual CMS data structures.
    *   Malicious input to the GnuPG API.
    *   Non-standard MIME trees.
    *   Crafted emails with spoofed sender identity.
    *   Embedded content mimicking UI elements.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious emails. They do not necessarily need to compromise the cryptographic keys themselves, but rather exploit weaknesses in how email clients interpret and display signature information.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of the specific vulnerabilities in the targeted email clients.
*   The attacker's position is that of an external sender, able to send crafted emails to the victim.

The identified affected clients include Thunderbird, Outlook, Apple Mail, and others.
