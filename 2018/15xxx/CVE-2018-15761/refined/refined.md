Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-15761:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability lies in a validation error within the Cloud Foundry UAA (User Account and Authentication) component. Specifically, it occurs when handling consent pages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insufficient Validation:** The UAA fails to properly validate the URL and content of consent pages, allowing manipulation.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** This validation error allows for privilege escalation, enabling users to gain higher level permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An authenticated attacker can modify the consent page's URL and content.
*   By doing so, the attacker can obtain tokens with arbitrary scopes.
*   This leads to privilege escalation, granting the attacker unauthorized access and control within the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** The attack can be performed remotely over a network.
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Cloud Foundry UAA.
*   **Consent Page Modification:** The attacker manipulates the URL and content of a consent page during the authorization process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must have a valid user account on the Cloud Foundry instance.
*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the UAA component and modify requests related to consent pages.

**Summary:**
CVE-2018-15761 describes a critical vulnerability in Cloud Foundry UAA where an authenticated user can exploit a lack of validation in consent page handling. This allows the attacker to modify consent page parameters and obtain tokens with elevated privileges, resulting in unauthorized access and control.
