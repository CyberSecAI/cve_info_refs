Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-15474

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of the "fullname" parameter during user registration in DokuWiki. This unsanitized input is then included in CSV exports.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CSV Formula Injection:**  The primary vulnerability is that user-provided input, specifically the "fullname" field, is not sanitized and is directly used in a CSV export. This allows an attacker to inject formulas into the CSV data. When an administrator opens the exported CSV file in spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel or Open Office, these formulas are executed, leading to potential harm.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious formulas into the fullname field that, when the exported CSV is opened, can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. For example, the provided proof of concept uses `=cmd|'/C calc'!A0` to launch `calc.exe`.
*   **Sensitive Data Exfiltration:** Malicious formulas could also be used to exfiltrate sensitive data from the victim's machine, depending on the capabilities of the spreadsheet software used.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **User Registration Page:** The vulnerability is exploited through the user registration page where an attacker can set the "fullname" parameter to a malicious formula.
*   **CSV Export:**  The attack requires an administrator to export user data as a CSV file and then open this file using spreadsheet software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** An attacker can trigger this vulnerability without needing an account, by accessing the public registration page.
*   **Ability to Register:** The attacker needs the ability to submit a registration request with a manipulated "fullname" parameter.
*   **Social Engineering/Trust:** The attack relies on the administrator's trust in the exported CSV file. Since the file originates from their own DokuWiki instance, they might ignore warnings generated by the spreadsheet software when opening the file.

**Additional details:**
*   The vendor was contacted but refused to issue a fix, deeming the issue a low severity.
*   Several versions of DokuWiki are affected, including releases from 2013 up to 2018-04-22a "Greebo".
*   The vulnerability is considered a "won't fix".
