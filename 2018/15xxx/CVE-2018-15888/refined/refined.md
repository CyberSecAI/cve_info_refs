Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability lies in the user registration process of ASPCMS V2.5.6. Specifically, the `Gender` parameter, intended to store user gender, is not properly validated before being inserted into the database. The application fails to verify that the input for the `Gender` parameter is a number and doesn't use quotes around the value when constructing the SQL insert query. This lack of input sanitization, combined with how Access databases handle long strings and numeric data types, allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The core vulnerability is an SQL injection vulnerability stemming from the improper handling of the `Gender` parameter in the user registration form.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to validate the `Gender` input to ensure it is a numeric value, which can be manipulated by an attacker.
*   **Missing Input Sanitization:**  The application uses a `filterPara` function on user inputs but it doesn't properly sanitize the `Gender` parameter or protect against SQL injection.
*   **Direct use of user controlled data:** The Gender variable is directly concatenated into the SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can manipulate the `Gender` parameter during registration to inject SQL code that modifies the `GroupID` for the new user, allowing them to register as a super administrator (GroupID 1), bypassing the intended group assignment (GroupID 3 for regular users) during registration.
*   **Full Control over the CMS:** By registering as an administrator, the attacker gains full control of the CMS, which could lead to complete compromise of the web application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User Registration Form:** The primary attack vector is the user registration form (`/member/reg.asp`).
*   **Manipulated POST request:** The attacker intercepts the user registration POST request and manipulates the `Gender` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Understanding of SQL Injection:** They need some knowledge of SQL and the specific database (Access) to craft the malicious payload.
*   **Basic Web Interaction:** The attacker only needs to register a user account and modify the request in transit.

**Technical Details:**

The attacker injects the following string (URL encoded) as the value for Gender parameter: `1,GroupID=1%00`  or similar using the access 16% truncation technique. When URL decoded, `%00` becomes a null byte which terminates the query after `GroupID=1`

The vulnerable SQL statement is similar to:
```sql
insert into {prefix}User(LoginName,[Password],Email,Mobile,Address,PostCode,Gender,QQ,UserStatus,RegIP,RegTime,GroupID,TrueName,Phone) values('testuser','testpassword','email','123456789','address','12345',1,GroupID=1 /*comment*/ ,'123456','127.0.0.1','2015-01-19 13:00:00',3,'testuser','123456');
```

The injection `1,GroupID=1%00` changes the query to:

```sql
insert into {prefix}User(LoginName,[Password],Email,Mobile,Address,PostCode,Gender,QQ,UserStatus,RegIP,RegTime,GroupID,TrueName,Phone) values('testuser','testpassword','email','123456789','address','12345',1,GroupID=1,'123456','127.0.0.1','2015-01-19 13:00:00',3,'testuser','123456');
```

This results in the user being assigned to group 1 (administrator group).
