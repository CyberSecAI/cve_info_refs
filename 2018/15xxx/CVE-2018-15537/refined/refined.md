The provided content is related to CVE-2018-15537.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a combination of insufficient file validation during upload and an insecure Apache configuration. Specifically, the `tele_package` functionality in OCS Inventory NG allows an authenticated user to upload a file, and the application does not properly validate that the uploaded file is not an executable. The Apache configuration includes a line that executes any file with the `.php` substring which allows an attacker to execute the uploaded malicious PHP file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The `tele_package` functionality does not sufficiently validate the uploaded file content or extension. It allows an attacker to upload a file containing malicious PHP code.
- **Insecure Apache Configuration:** The `AddType application/x-httpd-php .php` directive in the Apache configuration treats any file containing the `.php` substring as a PHP executable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the target server. By uploading and then executing a malicious PHP file, the attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker sends a crafted POST request to the `/ocsreports/index.php?function=tele_package` endpoint, including a malicious PHP payload within a zip file. The request includes the file name and location where it's to be saved.
- A second request renames the file making it accessible via the webserver.
- The attacker then sends a request to the newly uploaded file containing the malicious code which will be executed by the web server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be an authenticated user of the OCS Inventory NG application.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the target server.
