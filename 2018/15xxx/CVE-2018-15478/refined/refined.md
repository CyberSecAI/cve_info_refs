Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-15478:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an insecure device registration process. The activation code used to register a myStrom device with a cloud account was derived from the device's MAC address.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Predictable Activation Code:** The activation code, being based on the MAC address, was easily guessable or obtainable (from devices in shops).
*   **Lack of Device Authentication:** There was no proper authentication mechanism in place for device registration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Device Hijacking:** An attacker could register a device to their account before the rightful owner, effectively taking control of the device.
*   **Loss of Control for Owner:** The legitimate owner would be unable to control the device through their mobile app.
*   **Denial of Service (indirect):** While not a direct DoS, the owner would lose functionality of the device which is a form of denial of service
*   **Full Control:** Combined with other vulnerabilities, specifically, CVE-2018-15476 and CVE-2018-15480, the attacker could gain full control over the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote:** An attacker could remotely register an unregistered device to their account by guessing the MAC address and reverse engineering the protocol.
*   **Physical Access (Indirect):** The attacker could obtain MAC addresses by physically observing devices in stores before they were purchased and registered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Knowledge of MAC Address Derivation:** The attacker needed to know how the activation code was derived from the MAC address.
*   **Network Access (indirect):** To exploit this, the attacker would not need to be on the local network, but only needed to be able to send the malicious registration to the myStrom servers.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability only affected unregistered devices.
*   The attack would leave traces on the server side.
*   The fix involved issuing a device token during registration and using it for subsequent authentication.

**CVSS Score:**
CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L (7.0)
