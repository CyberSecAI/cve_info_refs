  "CVE-2018-15855": {
    "description": "Unchecked NULL pointer usage in xkbcommon before 0.8.1 could be used by local attackers to crash (NULL pointer dereference) the xkbcommon parser by supplying a crafted keymap file, because the XkbFile for an xkb_geometry section was mishandled.",
    "root_cause": "The XkbFile structure for xkb_geometry sections was mishandled, causing a NULL pointer dereference when the parser returned NULL and a consuming part of the code did not handle NULL values, leading to a crash.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "NULL pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service due to a crash in the xkbcommon parser.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local attackers can supply a crafted keymap file.",
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to supply a crafted keymap file to the vulnerable application or system. This can be achieved locally."
