Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-15425:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to the insecure deserialization of user-supplied content within the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The web-based management interface does not properly validate or sanitize serialized Java objects provided by users. This allows an attacker to send crafted malicious serialized data that can be deserialized by the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of the affected device.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The commands are executed with the privileges of the web server, which is described as non-root.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:** The attack occurs through the web-based management interface, making it a remote network-based attack.
*   **Crafted Serialized Java Object:** The attacker sends a crafted serialized Java object to exploit the deserialization vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must have valid administrator credentials to access and interact with the web-based management interface.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the vulnerable Cisco ISE device.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is independent of another vulnerability (CVE-2018-15424) affecting the same product.
*   There are no known workarounds, therefore patching is required.
*   The CVSS v3 base score for this vulnerability is 4.7, categorized as Medium severity.
*   The vulnerability is also tracked by Cisco bug ID CSCvj62592.
