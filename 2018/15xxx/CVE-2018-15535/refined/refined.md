Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-15535:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `ajax_calls.php` file, specifically in the `get_file` action. This allows an attacker to manipulate the `file` parameter in the request, using directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`) to access arbitrary files on the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal (Directory Traversal):** The application does not properly validate or sanitize the `file` parameter, allowing attackers to specify file paths outside of the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker can read the contents of any file on the server that the webserver process has access to, potentially including sensitive files such as configuration files, source code, and password files.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** An attacker can send a specially crafted GET request to the `ajax_calls.php` script, manipulating the `file` parameter to include directory traversal sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web application.
*   **No Authentication Required**: The provided exploit code indicates that no authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   The specific vulnerable request is:

    ```
    GET /filemanager/ajax_calls.php?action=get_file&sub_action=preview&preview_mode=text&title=source&file=../../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1
    ```

*   The `file` parameter is used to specify the file to be accessed. By including `../../` sequences, the attacker can traverse up the directory tree and access files outside of the intended directory.
*   The `preview_mode=text` parameter is used to display the file contents in the response

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 9.13.4 of the Responsive FileManager.
*   The vulnerability is referenced as "Path Traversal Allows to Read Any File" in the provided text.
*   The exploit-db page also mentions another vulnerability (CVE-2018-15536) related to path traversal during archive extraction. This vulnerability is separate from CVE-2018-15535.
