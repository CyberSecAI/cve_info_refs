Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-15390

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to the Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software failing to release spinlocks when the device is running low on system memory. This occurs specifically when FTP inspection is enabled, an access control rule with an associated FTP file policy is also enabled, and transit traffic is passing through the device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper resource management (specifically spinlocks) under low-memory conditions.
- Lack of proper error handling or resource release during low memory situations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit leads to a software panic on the affected device.
- The device reloads, resulting in a temporary Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attacker.
- Sending a high rate of transit traffic through an affected device to cause a low-memory condition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable device.
- The attacker does not require any prior authentication.

**Affected Products:**
- Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software Releases 6.2.3.x prior to Release 6.2.3.4, under specific conditions.
- Vulnerable when FTP inspection is enabled, an access control rule with an associated FTP file policy is enabled, and the software is running on:
    - 3000 Series Industrial Security Appliances (ISAs)
    - ASA 5500-X Series Next-Generation Firewalls
    - Firepower 2100 Series Security Appliances
    - Firepower 4100 Series Security Appliances
    - Firepower 9300 ASA Security Module
    - Firepower Threat Defense Virtual (FTDv)

**Additional Details:**
- FTP inspection is enabled by default in Cisco FTD Software.
- There are no workarounds other than disabling FTP inspection.
- The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
