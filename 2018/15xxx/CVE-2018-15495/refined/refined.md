Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-15495

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `upload.php` script in Responsive File Manager, specifically how it processes the `url` parameter when uploading files "from URL". It uses the `curl_exec` function with user-supplied input without proper sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to specify the `file://` protocol, enabling them to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** By manipulating the `url` parameter to use the `file://` protocol, an attacker can force the server to read local files.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The use of `curl_exec` with an unsanitized `url` parameter also allows the attacker to potentially use other protocols like `smb`, `ftp`, `scp`, and `telnet`, which can lead to SSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive files from the server's filesystem. Examples include configuration files, database credentials, and system files like `/etc/passwd`.
*   **Potential for SSRF:**  Exploiting the SSRF vulnerability could allow the attacker to interact with internal services or other external resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends an HTTP POST request to the `upload.php` script with a modified `url` parameter using the `file://` protocol to specify the path to the desired file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `upload.php` endpoint.
*   The attacker doesn't need any special privileges on the server. They only need to access the web application's upload functionality.

**Technical Details:**

1.  The attacker sends a POST request to `/filemanager/upload.php`.
2.  The `url` parameter within the POST request is set to `file:///etc/passwd` (or any other file on the server).
3.  The server processes the request, and the `curl_exec` function reads and returns the content of the specified file.
4.  The response includes a JSON object containing the contents of the file in the path and url.
5.  The attacker can download the file via the returned url.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is present in version 9.13.1 and possibly other versions of Responsive File Manager.
* The changelog.txt mentions "fix a vulnerability on url upload" in version 9.14.0
* The vulnerability was reported to the developer on 07/17/2018 without response.
