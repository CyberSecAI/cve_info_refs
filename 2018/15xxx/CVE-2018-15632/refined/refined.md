The provided content relates to CVE-2018-15632.

**Root Cause:** Improper input validation in the database creation logic of Odoo.

**Weaknesses:**
- Lack of proper validation on database initialization logic.
- Odoo's database user (db_user) having excessive privileges to connect to non-Odoo databases.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can initialize an empty database.
- Attackers can connect to the newly created database using default credentials.
- Attackers can trigger expensive computations or impact system resources, potentially leading to denial of service.
- If not properly secured, the attacker might access other existing databases.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network exploitable via crafted malicious requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the Odoo instance.
- The PostgreSQL user configured for Odoo (db_user) must have privileges to connect to non-Odoo databases.
- No authentication is required.
