Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the "bukutamu" (guestbook) page of AuraCMS. Specifically, the application allows users to inject arbitrary web scripts through the source editor.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. User-supplied input is not sanitized before being stored in the database.  When the guestbook page is viewed by other users (including administrators), the malicious script is executed in their browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account Hijacking:** An attacker can use the XSS vulnerability to steal the administrator's cookies. This allows them to impersonate the administrator and gain full control over the application.
- **Arbitrary Actions:**  The attacker can perform any action that the victim administrator can do within the application. This could include creating, modifying, or deleting content, user data, and potentially system configurations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **User Input:** The attack vector is through user-supplied input in the "Add Guestbook" functionality of the "bukutamu" page.
- **Malicious Payload:** The specific payload used is a simple JavaScript `alert(document.cookie)` to demonstrate the XSS vulnerability. However, the attacker can inject other malicious code to achieve the intended impact.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User Account:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the AuraCMS instance.
- **Guestbook Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to post messages on the guestbook page.
