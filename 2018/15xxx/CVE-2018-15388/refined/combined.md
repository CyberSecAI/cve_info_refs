"title": "Summary",
"text": "A vulnerability in the WebVPN login process of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause increased CPU utilization on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to excessive processing load for existing WebVPN login operations. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending multiple WebVPN login requests to the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to increase CPU load on the device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-sd-cpu-dos [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-sd-cpu-dos\"]"

"text": "This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products that are running Cisco ASA Software or FTD Software when configured for WebVPN:\r\n\r\n 3000 Series Industrial Security Appliances (ISAs)\r\n Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) 1000V Cloud Firewall\r\n ASA 5505 Series Adaptive Security Appliance1\r\n ASA 5500-X Series Firewalls\r\n ASA Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers\r\n Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv)\r\n Firepower 2100 Series\r\n Firepower 4100 Series\r\n Firepower 9300 ASA Security Module\r\n Firepower Threat Defense Virtual\r\n\r\n1ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances other than the ASA 5505 have reached the end-of-support milestone and are no longer evaluated for security vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco ASA Software and FTD Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory.\r\n Determining If WebVPN Is Enabled\r\nTo determine if the WebVPN service is enabled on a device, administrators can use the show running-config webvpn privileged EXEC command and refer to the output of the command. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that has the WebVPN service enabled:\r\n\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show running-config webvpn\r\n\r\n\r\n.\r\n. . webvpn enable interface\_name . . .\r\n\r\n Determining the Cisco ASA Software Release\r\nTo determine which Cisco ASA Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version | include Version command in the CLI, and refer to the output of the command. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.9.2.18:\r\n\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show version | include Version\r\nCisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 9.9.2.18 Device Manager Version 7.4(1) . . .\r\n\r\nIf a device is managed by using Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM), administrators can also determine which release is running on a device by referring to the release information in the table that appears in the Cisco ASDM login window or the Device Dashboard tab of the Cisco ASDM Home pane.\r\n Determining the Cisco FTD Software Release\r\nTo determine which Cisco FTD Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the CLI, and refer to the output of the command. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco FTD Software Release 6.2.0:\r\n\r\n\r\n> show version\r\n ---------------------[ ftd ]--------------------- Model : Cisco ASA5525-X Threat Defense (75) Version 6.2.0 (Build 362) UUID : 2849ba3c-ecb8-11e6-98ca-b9fc2975893c Rules update version : 2017-03-15-001-vrt VDB version : 279 ----------------------------------------------------"

| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software and Firepower Threat Defense Software WebVPN Denial of Service Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20190501-sd-cpu-dos  First Published: 2019 May 1 16:00 GMT  Last Updated:  2019 May 2 17:57 GMT  Version 1.1:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCvj33780](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvj33780)     CVE-2018-15388     CWE-400       CVSS Score: [Base 8.6](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.0&vector=CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2018-15388     CWE-400       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-sd-cpu-dos/csaf/cisco-sa-20190501-sd-cpu-dos.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the WebVPN login process of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause increased CPU utilization on an affected device.  The vulnerability is due to excessive processing load for existing WebVPN login operations. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending multiple WebVPN login requests to the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to increase CPU load on the device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products that are running Cisco ASA Software or FTD Software when configured for WebVPN:    + 3000 Series Industrial Security Appliances (ISAs)   + Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) 1000V Cloud Firewall   + ASA 5505 Series Adaptive Security Appliance1   + ASA 5500-X Series Firewalls   + ASA Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers   + Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv)   + Firepower 2100 Series   + Firepower 4100 Series   + Firepower 9300 ASA Security Module   + Firepower Threat Defense Virtual 1ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances other than the ASA 5505 have reached the end-of-support milestone and are no longer evaluated for security vulnerabilities.  For information about which Cisco ASA Software and FTD Software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Determining If WebVPN Is Enabled To determine if the WebVPN service is enabled on a device, administrators can use the **show running-config webvpn** privileged EXEC command and refer to the output of the command. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that has the WebVPN service enabled:  ```   ciscoasa# show running-config webvpn   ```  ```   .   .   .   webvpn   enable interface_name   .   .   .   ```   Determining the Cisco ASA Software Release To determine which Cisco ASA Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the **show version | include Version** command in the CLI, and refer to the output of the command. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.9.2.18:  ```   ciscoasa# show version | include Version   Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 9.9.2.18   Device Manager Version 7.4(1)   .   .   .   ```  If a device is managed by using Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM), administrators can also determine which release is running on a device by referring to the release information in the table that appears in the Cisco ASDM login window or the **Device Dashboard** tab of the Cisco ASDM Home pane. Determining the Cisco FTD Software Release To determine which Cisco FTD Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the **show version** command in the CLI, and refer to the output of the command. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco FTD Software Release 6.2.0:  ```   > show version      ---------------------[ ftd ]---------------------   Model : Cisco ASA5525-X Threat Defense (75) Version 6.2.0 (Build 362)   UUID : 2849ba3c-ecb8-11e6-98ca-b9fc2975893c   Rules update version : 2017-03-15-001-vrt   VDB version : 279   ----------------------------------------------------   ``` Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Indicators of Compromise  * During active exploitation of this vulnerability, administrators may notice increased CPU usage by the **Unicorn Proxy Thread** process. This can be checked by issuing the **show processes cpu-usage non-zero** command at the CLI and reviewing the statistics for the **Unicorn Proxy Thread** process.  ```   ciscoasa# show processes cpu-usage non-zeroHardware:   ASA5516Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 9.8(2)38ASLR enabled, text region 7f313ea71000-7f3142d61bb4PC         Thread       5Sec     1Min     5Min   Process0x00007f3140f35888   0x00002aaacfaa8b20     7.7%     5.0%     3.0%   Unicorn Proxy Thread   -          -         9.5%     1.9%     0.8%   DATAPATH-0-2044   -          -         3.6%     1.4%     0.8%   DATAPATH-1-2045      ``` It should be noted that the previous output is an example. Administrators would need to compare the output values from their device to baseline values from normal device operation.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  It is possible that during active exploitation an administrator could mitigate the attack by implementing an ACL to block the incoming requests or perform rate-limiting.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:      <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 8.6 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 8.6 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 8.6 |
