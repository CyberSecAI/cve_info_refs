Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-15388:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by an excessive processing load during WebVPN login operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary weakness is the susceptibility to a denial-of-service attack due to the excessive CPU usage during WebVPN login attempts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Increased CPU Utilization:** A successful exploit leads to increased CPU load on the affected device.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The increased CPU load can result in a denial-of-service condition, making the device unresponsive and disrupting normal operations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable by an unauthenticated, remote attacker over the network.
*   **Multiple WebVPN Login Requests:** The attacker sends a high volume of WebVPN login requests to trigger the excessive processing load.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Remote Access:** The attacker needs the ability to send network traffic to the vulnerable device. No authentication is required to trigger this vulnerability.
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the target device configured with WebVPN.
*   **Ability to Generate Traffic:** The attacker needs the ability to generate a high number of WebVPN login requests.

**Summary of Key Information:**

*   **Vulnerable Products:** Cisco ASA Software and Cisco FTD Software when configured for WebVPN.
*   **Affected Components:** The WebVPN login process.
*   **Mitigation:**  Cisco recommends upgrading to the fixed software releases. There are no workarounds, but during an active attack, blocking incoming requests or rate-limiting may mitigate the attack.
*   **Indicator of Compromise:** Increased CPU usage by the "Unicorn Proxy Thread" process.
*   **CVSS Score:** 8.6 (High)
*   **CWE:** CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption)
