Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2018-15845:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The Gleez CMS application lacks proper CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection on the user creation endpoint (`/admin/users/add`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The application does not validate the origin of the request when creating a new user via the `/admin/users/add` endpoint, which allows an attacker to forge requests.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Administrative Account Creation:** An attacker can create a new administrator account on the vulnerable Gleez CMS instance without needing the current admin's credentials or explicit consent. This grants the attacker complete control over the system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page with a form that submits a request to the vulnerable `/admin/users/add` endpoint of the target Gleez CMS installation.
*   This HTML page is served to the administrator of the Gleez CMS installation, often through social engineering techniques such as an email or malicious link.
*   When the administrator opens the malicious HTML page, their browser, if logged into the Gleez CMS, automatically makes the request to add a new admin user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator user to visit a malicious page crafted by the attacker.
* The attacker must know the path of the vulnerable endpoint (`/admin/users/add`).
* The attacker needs to know the required fields to add an admin user, including the anti-CSRF token for the session.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit code provided shows an HTML form that includes hidden fields for the required parameters to create a new administrator account (username, password, email, admin role, CSRF token).
*   The vulnerability affects Gleez CMS version 1.2.0.
* The proof-of-concept HTML code demonstrates how to exploit the CSRF vulnerability to create a new admin user account.
