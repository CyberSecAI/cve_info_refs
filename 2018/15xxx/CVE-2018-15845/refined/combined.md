We hate reinventing the wheel. But when the wheel doesn't exist, or is square, we're not afraid to invent a round one.

### What Is Gleez CMS?

Gleez is an open source, [extensible Content Management System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) that is built on the [Kohana Framework](http://kohanaframework.org). Gleez is the fusion of many good concepts from the 4 most popular systems: Joomla, Drupal, Wordpress and Ruby Rails. With years of experience using these, we've gathered great ideas and in some cases, improved on them.

With an emphasis on security and functionality, Gleez is a professional and robust system suitable for any business or organization. Built on the PHP programming language and the MySQL database, Gleez delivers superb performance on any size application.

#### Modules

Modules - Code that extends the functionality of Gleez. We just call them "Modules", others call it "Plugins"(Wordpress) or "Modules"(Drupal), but it's a more general term. Everything you can use for Gleez is an Extension.

#### Themes

Themes - the look and layout of a Gleez. A theme consists of one or more PHP files that define the HTML output of your site's pages, along with one or more CSS files that define the layout, fonts, colors, and other styles.

#### Widgets

Widgets - the mini content boxes of a page. Others call it "Modules"(Joomla), "Blocks"(Drupal), and also "Widgets"(Wordpress). Extend the functionality by themes using unlimited regions.

#### Users & Groups

Users, Roles, and Permissions. Users on your site can be assigned permissions via roles. Permissions are quite flexible -- you are allowed to assign permission for any task to any role, depending on the needs of your site.

#### Taxonomy & Tags

Gleez uses [MPTT](http://www.sitepoint.com/hierarchical-data-database-2/) system for classifying content, which is known as taxonomy and implemented in the core. You can define your own vocabularies (groups of taxonomy terms), and add terms to each vocabulary.

#### SEO

Canonical URL: the search engine friendly URL that you want the search engines to treat as authoritative. Clean url's, canocial & shortlinks are in core for SEO. Gleez adds meta tags support and url aliases handled by path class.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
