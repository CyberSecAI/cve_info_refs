- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerabilities exist because the affected software improperly validates Advanced Recording Format (ARF) and Webex Recording Format (WRF) files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation when processing ARF and WRF files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could send a user a malicious ARF or WRF file via a link or an email attachment and persuade the user to open the file by using the affected software.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a malicious ARF/WRF file to a user and convince them to open it with a vulnerable version of the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player or Cisco Webex Player. The attacker does not need to be local to the system. The user must interact with the malicious file.
