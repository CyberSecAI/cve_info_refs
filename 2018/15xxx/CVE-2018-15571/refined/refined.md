Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-15571:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided data when generating CSV files. Specifically, the WordPress "Export Users to CSV" plugin fails to neutralize potentially harmful characters in user profile fields before exporting the data into a CSV file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSV Injection (Formula Injection):** The core weakness is the failure to sanitize user input that is included in CSV files. This allows an attacker to inject spreadsheet formulas into user fields, that are then exported into a CSV. When the CSV file is opened with spreadsheet software (like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets), the formulas will be executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By injecting malicious formulas into the CSV file, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the machine of the user who opens the file, typically an administrator.
- **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to the compromise of the administrator's machine, potentially allowing attackers to steal sensitive data, pivot to other systems, or install malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious user injects a payload into a profile field (e.g., biography). The payload contains spreadsheet formulas starting with characters such as `=`, `@`, `-`, or `+`.
- A WordPress administrator uses the vulnerable plugin to export user data to a CSV file.
- When the administrator opens the generated CSV file, the injected formulas are executed by the spreadsheet application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account (at any privilege level) in the vulnerable WordPress site.
- The attacker needs the ability to modify their profile data on the website.
- The attacker needs an administrator or other user with higher privileges to export the data via the vulnerable plugin.
- The attacker relies on a target opening the exported CSV with software vulnerable to CSV injection.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit uses formulas like `=SUM(1+1)*cmd|'/C calc'!A0` to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine.
- Alternative payloads provided include `+SUM(1+1)*cmd|'/C calc'!A0`, `-SUM(1+1)*cmd|'/C calc'!A0`, and `@SUM(1+1)*cmd|'/C calc'!A0`. These variations are used because spreadsheet applications may recognize these prefixes as formulas.
- The vulnerability exists in the "Export Users to CSV" plugin version 1.1.1 and possibly earlier versions.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported to the developer, who did not acknowledge it, resulting in the public disclosure of the vulnerability.
- The plugin has been closed as of January 28, 2019, due to the security issue.
- The plugin had over 20,000 active installations.
