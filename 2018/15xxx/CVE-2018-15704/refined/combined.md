* title
* url
* lc
* rc
* tc
* bc

All of these parameters can be abused to inject malicious JavaScript and HTML into the page. Furthermore, the *url* parameter is used as the source of an iframe in the generated page. Below are code snippets showing the vulnerable code.

```

title_desc = <%="'" + Request.QueryString("title") + "'"%>;
page_url = <%="'" + Request.QueryString("url") + "'"%>;

left_c   = <%="'" + Request.QueryString("lc") + "'"%>;
right_c  = <%="'" + Request.QueryString("rc") + "'"%>;
top_c    = <%="'" + Request.QueryString("tc") + "'"%>;
bottom_c = <%="'" + Request.QueryString("bc") + "'"%>;

… snip …

document.write("<IFRAME NAME=page FRAMEBORDER=no WIDTH=100% HEIGHT=100% SRC='" + page_url + "' STYLE=position:relative;display:block>");

```

The following are proof of concepts:

#### CVE-2018-15704: Authenticated Stack Buffer Overflow

A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in **BwOpcBs.exe**. An authenticated remote attacker can reach the vulnerability via **/broadweb/system/opcImg.asp** . This is due to a lack of input validation during the processing of the *sv* parameter. This parameter value is used to dynamically construct a command line, which is then passed to the RemoteWinExec function defined within **webdobj.webdraw**. Finally, **BwOpcBs.exe** is launched with the value of *sv* as its second command line argument.

The command line looks like such, where <sv> is the value of the *sv* parameter:

```

Bwopcbs.exe 1 <sv>

```

The **BwOpcBs.exe** executable does not properly validate its command line arguments, and a stack buffer can be overflowed by specifying a large value in *sv*. Specifically, a buffer consisting of 492 bytes will overwrite the instruction pointer.

In order for an attacker to successfully exploit this vulnerability, the following parameters must be specified when requesting **opcImc.asp**:

* proj
* node
* opt

Values for *proj* and *node* must be known prior to launching an attack. These can be discovered by performing the following steps:

1. Visit **/WADashboard/login?cont=dashboardViewer** in a web browser.
2. Project names will be listed in the drop-down menu.
3. Choose a project name.
4. Visit **/broadweb/<project name>.dpj**. Replace <project name> with the project you selected.
5. Notice that there are node names listed. Choose a node name.

The value of 'opt' must be 1.

Using this information, a remote attacker may craft a malicious URL to be sent to a WebAccess administrator. Once this URL is visited the exploit would be launched. Below is a code snippet in **opcImc.asp** showing the vulnerable code.

```

if opt = 1 then
	if instr(UCase(opcServer), "RW.FASERVER" ) > 0 then
		cmdLine = "Bwopcbs.exe 1 " + Request.QueryString("sv")
	else
		cmdLine = "Bwopcbs.exe 1 " + Request.QueryString("sv")
	end if
end if

select case opt
case 1
	tObj.RemoteWinExec proj, node, cmdLine
	tObj.BwSleep(100)
	tObj.RemoteFileTransfer proj, node, ".", ".", "Bwopcbs.ini", 0

```

The following is output from WinDbg, showing an access violation. Notice that EIP is overwritten with 0x41414141 ("AAAA").
