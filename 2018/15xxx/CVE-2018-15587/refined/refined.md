{
  "CVE-2018-15587": {
    "Description": "GNOME Evolution through 3.28.2 is prone to OpenPGP signatures being spoofed for arbitrary messages using a specially crafted email that contains a valid signature from the entity to be impersonated as an attachment.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability arises from the way GNOME Evolution processes OpenPGP signatures, allowing a specially crafted email with a valid signature as an attachment to be used to spoof a signature for the main email body.",
     "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of multipart MIME messages with signatures.",
        "Insufficient validation of the context of the signature, especially when attached."
      ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can craft emails that appear to be signed by a legitimate user, potentially leading to social engineering attacks, phishing, or other forms of deception.",
    "Attack vectors": "The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted email message delivered via network.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have a valid OpenPGP signature from the entity they want to impersonate, obtained from past communications, public sources, etc. They also need to be able to send an email message to a target."
