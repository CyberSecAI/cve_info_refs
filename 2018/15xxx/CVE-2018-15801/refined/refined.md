- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An authorization bypass vulnerability exists in Spring Security due to improper validation of JWT (JSON Web Token) issuers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the JWT issuer validation process. If the same private key is used for both a legitimate issuer and a malicious user, the malicious user can create JWTs with a malicious issuer URL that might be accepted as valid for the legitimate issuer. This bypasses the intended authorization checks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious user can gain unauthorized access by creating forged JWTs with a manipulated issuer URL that is accepted by the system as if they were issued by the legitimate issuer.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to create a forged JWT with a malicious issuer URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to sign JWTs using the same private key as the legitimate issuer, or have access to the legitimate issuer's private key.
