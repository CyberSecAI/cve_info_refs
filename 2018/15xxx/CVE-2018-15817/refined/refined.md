Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerabilities:

**Summary**

The blog post details several exploitable and probably exploitable crashes found in FastStone Image Viewer 6.5. These crashes were discovered through fuzzing, and the author provided crash details including WinDbg logs.

**Vulnerabilities**

The blog post identifies several distinct crashes, each triggered by specific crafted image files. The majority of the exploitable crashes are due to an **invalid pointer write** at address `image00400000+0xe1237`, specifically caused by a `mov word ptr [esi],cx` instruction. A few of the crashes are caused by a different write at address `image00400000+0x1cb509`, specifically caused by the instruction `mov byte ptr [eax+2],dl`. One crash is caused by a read access violation in a block data move. Finally one crash is due to exception handler chain corruption.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the exploitable crashes are due to memory corruption caused by processing malformed image files. The specific parsing bugs in image handling lead to invalid memory writes or reads. The blog post doesn't provide specific details as to what exactly is being parsed wrong, but does provide the malformed image files to reproduce the issue

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**

*   **Invalid Pointer Write:** Multiple crashes involve writing to invalid memory locations, which can be exploited to control program execution.
*   **Read Access Violation**: Two crashes involve reading from invalid memory locations, this could lead to information leakage or exploitable conditions.
*   **Exception Handler Chain Corruption**: One crash is due to corruption of the exception handler chain, this allows the attacker to take control of execution flow.

**Impact of Exploitation**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The identified write access violations are classified as "EXPLOITABLE", indicating that an attacker could potentially overwrite critical data or code pointers, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Denial of Service:**  Even if code execution is not achieved, the crashes themselves can cause a denial of service, preventing the user from using the application.

**Attack Vectors**

*   **Malicious Image File:**  The primary attack vector involves tricking a user into opening a specially crafted image file using FastStone Image Viewer 6.5. This can be done via email attachments, websites or other file sharing methods.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**

*   **Crafted Image Files:** The attacker needs to be able to create or obtain crafted image files that trigger the identified vulnerabilities.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to entice a user to open the crafted file using the vulnerable software.
*   **No special system privileges are required**.

**Technical Details (from WinDbg logs)**

The WinDbg logs reveal that:

*   The crashes occur at various memory addresses, specifically `004e1237`, `005cb509`, `00402d7d`, `00402d63`, and `007ef68a`.
*   The instruction `mov word ptr [esi],cx` is responsible for the invalid writes in several crashes, whereas `mov byte ptr [eax+2],dl` is responsible for other write crashes and `rep movs dword ptr es:[edi],dword ptr [esi]` for the read access violations. Finally, `mov dword ptr [edx],eax` is responsible for the exception chain corruption.
*   The memory addresses being written to are invalid and far from NULL which suggests exploitation is more likely
*   The `!exploitable` plugin classifies the write access violations as "EXPLOITABLE" or "PROBABLY_EXPLOITABLE", highlighting their severity.
*   The crashes occur when processing TIFF and GIF files.

**Additional Notes**

*   The author attempted to contact FastStone about these vulnerabilities on August 3, 2018, but received no response.
*   The blog post also provides a link to a GitHub repository containing the crash-inducing files for those who want to reproduce the issues.
*   The crashes are triggered on a Windows XP system, although it may be vulnerable on other windows systems as well.

**Relevance to CVE-2018-15817**

Given the provided information, it's impossible to definitively link this content to CVE-2018-15817, since the CVE description is a placeholder. However, based on the time frame and nature of the vulnerabilities (memory corruption in image processing), it's possible this content is related. More information would be needed from the official CVE description to confirm.

If the CVE description for CVE-2018-15817 describes a memory corruption vulnerability in FastStone Image Viewer, specifically related to processing TIFF or GIF files, it is likely related.
