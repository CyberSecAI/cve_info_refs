| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco Adaptive Security Appliance Direct Memory Access Denial of Service Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20181003-asa-dma-dos  First Published: 2018 October 3 16:00 GMT  Last Updated:  2018 October 29 14:02 GMT  Version 1.1:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCvj89470](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvj89470)     CVE-2018-15383     CWE-770       CVSS Score: [Base 8.6](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.0&vector=CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2018-15383     CWE-770       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181003-asa-dma-dos/csaf/cisco-sa-20181003-asa-dma-dos.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the cryptographic hardware accelerator driver of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a temporary denial of service (DoS) condition.  The vulnerability exists because the affected devices have a limited amount of Direct Memory Access (DMA) memory and the affected software improperly handles resources in low-memory conditions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a sustained, high rate of malicious traffic to an affected device to exhaust memory on the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust DMA memory on the affected device, which could cause the device to reload and result in a temporary DoS condition.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:   <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181003-asa-dma-dos>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software or Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software:    + ASA 5506-X with FirePOWER Services   + ASA 5506H-X with FirePOWER Services   + ASA 5506W-X with FirePOWER Services   + ASA 5508-X with FirePOWER Services   + ASA 5516-X with FirePOWER Services This vulnerability also affects the preceding products if FirePOWER Services are not installed or enabled.  For information about which Cisco ASA Software and Cisco FTD Software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Determine the Cisco ASA Software Release To determine which Cisco ASA Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the **show version** command in the CLI, and refer to the output of the command. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.4(4):  ```   ciscoasa# show version | include Version      Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 9.4(4)   Device Manager Version 7.4(1)   .   .   .   ```  If a device is managed by using Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM), administrators can also determine which release is running on a device by referring to the release information in the table that appears in the Cisco ASDM log in window or the **Device Dashboard** tab of the Cisco ASDM Home pane. Determine the Cisco FTD Software Release To determine which Cisco FTD Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the **show version** command in the CLI, and refer to the output of the command. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco FTD Software Release 6.2.0:  ```   > show version      ---------------------[ ftd ]---------------------   Model : Cisco ASA5525-X Threat Defense (75) Version 6.2.0 (Build 362)   UUID : 2849ba3c-ecb8-11e6-98ca-b9fc2975893c   Rules update version : 2017-03-15-001-vrt   VDB version : 279   ----------------------------------------------------   ``` Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + 3000 Series Industrial Security Appliances (ISAs)   + 7600 Series ASA Services Module   + Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv)   + ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall   + ASA 5512-X with FirePOWER Services   + ASA 5515-X with FirePOWER Services   + ASA 5525-X with FirePOWER Services   + ASA 5545-X with FirePOWER Services   + ASA 5555-X with FirePOWER Services   + ASA 5585-X with FirePOWER SSP-10, SSP-20, SSP-40, or SSP-60   + ASA 5505 Adaptive Security Appliance   + ASA 5510 Adaptive Security Appliance   + ASA 5512-X Adaptive Security Appliance   + ASA 5515-X Adaptive Security Appliance   + ASA 5520 Adaptive Security Appliance   + ASA 5525-X Adaptive Security Appliance   + ASA 5540 Adaptive Security Appliance   + ASA 5545-X Adaptive Security Appliance   + ASA 5550 Adaptive Security Appliance   + ASA 5555-X Adaptive Security Appliance   + ASA 5580 Adaptive Security Appliance   + ASA 5585-X Adaptive Security Appliance   + Catalyst 6500 Series ASA Services Module   + Firepower 2100 Series Security Appliances   + Firepower 4100 Series Security Appliances   + FirePOWER 7000 Series Appliances   + FirePOWER 8000 Series Appliances   + Firepower 9300 ASA Security Module   + Firepower Threat Defense Virtual (FTDv)  Details  * The vulnerability described in this advisory exists because the affected devices have a limited amount of DMA memory and the affected software improperly handles resources in low-memory conditions. When the affected software cannot allocate DMA memory, the software may cause a device to crash and reload, resulting in a temporary DoS condition.  To address this vulnerability, Cisco corrected how the software handles resources in low-memory conditions. Cisco also implemented a DMA\_MEM\_ALLOC\_FAILED protocol stack counter that administrators can use to determine whether and how many DMA memory allocation failures have occurred on a device. Sustained periods of DMA memory allocation failures could adversely impact traffic that is sent through a device.  To check the value of the DMA\_MEM\_ALLOC\_FAILED counter, administrators can use the **show counters** privileged EXEC command in the device CLI, as shown in the following example:  ```   ciscoasa# show counters      Protocol     Counter                                       Value   Context...CRYPTO       DMA_MEM_ALLOC_FAILED                              1   Summary   ```  If the value of the DMA\_MEM\_ALLOC\_FAILED counter increases quickly for a sustained period of time, administrators should contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) for further investigation.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 8.6 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 8.6 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 8.6 |

"text": "The vulnerability described in this advisory exists because the affected devices have a limited amount of DMA memory and the affected software improperly handles resources in low-memory conditions. When the affected software cannot allocate DMA memory, the software may cause a device to crash and reload, resulting in a temporary DoS condition.\r\n\r\nTo address this vulnerability, Cisco corrected how the software handles resources in low-memory conditions. Cisco also implemented a DMA\_MEM\_ALLOC\_FAILED protocol stack counter that administrators can use to determine whether and how many DMA memory allocation failures have occurred on a device. Sustained periods of DMA memory allocation failures could adversely impact traffic that is sent through a device.\r\n\r\nTo check the value of the DMA\_MEM\_ALLOC\_FAILED counter, administrators can use the show counters privileged EXEC command in the device CLI, as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show counters\r\n Protocol Counter Value Context\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\nCRYPTO DMA\_MEM\_ALLOC\_FAILED 1 Summary\r\n\r\nIf the value of the DMA\_MEM\_ALLOC\_FAILED counter increases quickly for a sustained period of time, administrators should contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) for further investigation."
