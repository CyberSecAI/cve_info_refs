Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability exists because affected Cisco ASA and FTD devices have a limited amount of Direct Memory Access (DMA) memory.
*   The software on these devices improperly handles resources when DMA memory is low.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Resource Handling:** The software fails to manage DMA memory effectively in low-memory conditions.
*   **Limited DMA Memory:** The devices have a constrained amount of DMA memory available for operations.
*   **Lack of Workarounds**: There are no workarounds to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability, only a software patch.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit leads to the device reloading, causing a temporary DoS condition.
*   **Device Crash:** When the software can't allocate DMA memory, it causes the device to crash and reload.
*   **Traffic Disruption:** Sustained DMA memory allocation failures can negatively impact traffic passing through the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Attack:** An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over a network.
*   **Malicious Traffic:** The attacker sends a high rate of malicious traffic to the affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable device.
*   **Unauthenticated:** No prior authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Ability to Generate Traffic:** The attacker must be able to generate a sustained, high rate of network traffic.

**Additional Details:**

*   Cisco has implemented a `DMA_MEM_ALLOC_FAILED` counter which administrators can use to monitor DMA memory allocation failures.
*   The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
