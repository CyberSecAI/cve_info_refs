The provided content is related to CVE-2018-1002103.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Kubernetes Dashboard in minikube was exposed with a configuration vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks. Specifically, the dashboard was listening on the VM IP at port 30000, which was predictable in some VM environments.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    -  DNS rebinding vulnerability allowed attackers to bypass the Same-Origin Policy.
    -  Lack of HTTP header checks.
    - The dashboard was exposed on a predictable IP address.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Arbitrary code execution within the victim's minikube cluster.
    - Potential for VM escape to the host operating system if combined with a VM-specific vulnerability.
    - Direct access to the host filesystem if `minikube mount` was in use.
    - Creation of new Kubernetes Deployments with attacker-controlled payloads.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attacker would need to trick a victim into visiting a malicious webpage.
    - The attacker would use DNS rebinding to make requests to the Kubernetes Dashboard without violating the Same-Origin Policy.
    - The attacker could use the `/api/v1/csrftoken/appdeploymentfromfile` to generate a CSRF token and subsequently use it with `/api/v1/appdeploymentfromfile` to deploy a malicious workload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to have knowledge of the predictable IP address of the minikube VM.
    - The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious web page and lure the victim into visiting it.
    - No prior authentication is needed because the attack bypasses the Same-Origin Policy.
