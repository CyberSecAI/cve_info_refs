## How to fix?

Upgrade `unzipper` to version 0.8.13 or higher.

## Overview

[`unzipper`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/unzipper) is an Unzip cross-platform streaming API.

Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Write via Archive Extraction (AKA "Zip Slip").

It is exploited using a specially crafted zip archive, that holds path traversal filenames. When exploited, a filename in a malicious archive is concatenated to the target extraction directory, which results in the final path ending up outside of the target folder. For instance, a zip may hold a file with a "../../file.exe" location and thus break out of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.

The following is an example of a zip archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicous file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:

```

+2018-04-15 22:04:29 ..... 19 19 good.txt

+2018-04-15 22:04:42 ..... 20 20 ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys

```

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

9.4 critical

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **High**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

  **High**

# Zip Slip Vulnerability

Zip Slip is a widespread arbitrary file overwrite critical vulnerability, which typically results in remote command execution. It was discovered and responsibly disclosed by the Snyk Security team ahead of a public disclosure on 5th June 2018, and affects thousands of projects, including ones from HP, Amazon, Apache, Pivotal and  [many more (CVEs and full list here).](https://github.com/snyk/zip-slip-vulnerability)  Of course, this type of vulnerability has existed before, but recently it has manifested itself in a much larger number of projects and libraries.

![Zip Slip](https://res.cloudinary.com/snyk/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,c_thumb,h_225,w_225/v1527156415/research/zipslip.png)

The vulnerability has been found in multiple ecosystems, including JavaScript, Ruby, .NET and Go, but is especially prevalent in Java, where there is no central library offering high level processing of archive (e.g. zip) files. The lack of such a library led to vulnerable code snippets being hand crafted and shared among developer communities such as  [StackOverflow.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/981578/how-to-unzip-files-recursively-in-java)

The vulnerability is exploited using a specially crafted archive that holds directory traversal filenames (e.g. ../../evil.sh). The Zip Slip vulnerability can affect numerous archive formats, including tar, jar, war, cpio, apk, rar and 7z. If you’d like the information on this page in a downloadable technical white paper, click the button below.

 [Download Technical White Paper](https://res.cloudinary.com/snyk/image/upload/v1528192501/zip-slip-vulnerability/technical-whitepaper.pdf)

Zip Slip is a form of directory traversal that can be exploited by extracting files from an archive. The premise of the directory traversal vulnerability is that an attacker can gain access to parts of the file system outside of the target folder in which they should reside. The attacker can then overwrite executable files and either invoke them remotely or wait for the system or user to call them, thus achieving remote command execution on the victim’s machine. The vulnerability can also cause damage by overwriting configuration files or other sensitive resources, and can be exploited on both client (user) machines and servers.

##### Exploitable Application Flow

The two parts required to exploit this vulnerability is a malicious archive and extraction code that does not perform validation checking. Let’s look through each of these in turn. First of all, the contents of the zip file needs to have one or more files that break out of the target directory when extracted. In the example below, we can see the contents of a zip file. It has two files, a good.sh file which would be extracted into the target directory and an evil.sh file which is trying to traverse up the directory tree to hit the root and then add a file into the tmp directory. When you attempt to cd .. in the root directory, you still find yourself in the root directory, so a malicious path could contain many levels of ../ to stand a better chance of reaching the root directory, before trying to traverse to sensitive files.

```
  5 Tue Jun 5 11:04:29 BST 2018 good.sh 20 Tue Jun 5 11:04:42 BST 2018 ../../../../../../../../tmp/evil.sh
```

The contents of this zip file have to be hand crafted. Archive creation tools don’t typically allow users to add files with these paths, despite the zip specification allowing it. However, with the right tools, it’s easy to create files with these paths.

 The second thing you’ll need to exploit this vulnerability is to extract the archive, either using your own code or a library. The vulnerability exists when the extraction code omits validation on the file paths in the archive. An example of a vulnerable code snippet (example shown in Java) can be seen below.

```
  1   Enumeration<ZipEntry>entries = zip.getEntries();
  2   while (entries.hasMoreElements()) {
  3       ZipEntry e = entries.nextElement();
  4       File f = new File(destinationDir, e.getName());
  5       InputStream input = zip.getInputStream(e);
  6       IOUtils.copy(input, write(f));
  7   }
```

You can see on line 4, e.getName() is concatenated with the target directory, dir, without being validated. At this point, when our zip archive gets to our evil.sh, it will append the full path (including every ../) of the zip entry to the target directory resulting in evil.sh being written outside of the target directory.

 To see Zip Slip in action,  [watch us exploit the vulnerable java-goof application](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1MT5lr4p9o)  , a sample application used to show many known vulnerabilities.

##### Are you Vulnerable?

You are vulnerable if you are either using a library which contains the Zip Slip vulnerability or your project directly contains vulnerable code, which extracts files from an archive without the necessary directory traversal validation. Snyk is maintaining a [GitHub repository listing all](https://github.com/snyk/zip-slip-vulnerability) projects that have been found vulnerable to Zip Slip and have been responsibly disclosed to, including fix dates and versions. The repository is open to contributions from the wider community to ensure it holds the most up to date status.s.

##### What action should you take?

Here are some steps you can take to check if your project’s dependencies of code contain the Zip Slip vulnerability:

##### 1. Search through your projects for vulnerable code.

JavaGroovyJavaScript.NETGoRuby & Python
##### 2. Add Zip Slip Security Testing to your application build pipeline

If you’d prefer not to search through your direct and transitive dependencies (of which you likely have hundreds) to determine if you’re using a vulnerable library, you can choose a dependency vulnerability scanning tool, like Snyk. It’s a good practice to add security testing into your development lifecycle stages, such as during development, CI, deployment and production. You can test your own projects (all the ecosystems mentioned above are supported) to determine if they are vulnerable to Zip Slip.

##### Other vulnerable projects

Vulnerable projects include projects in various ecosystems that either use the libraries mentioned above or directly include vulnerable code. Of the many thousands of projects that have contained similar vulnerable code samples or accessed vulnerable libraries, the most significant include: Oracle, Amazon, Spring/Pivotal, Linkedin, Twitter, Alibaba, Jenkinsci, Eclipse, OWASP, SonarQube, OpenTable, Arduino, ElasticSearch, Selenium, JetBrains and Google.

##### Thank you!

The Snyk security team would like for thank all the vendors, project owners and the community members that helped raise awareness, find and fix vulnerabilities in projects across many ecosystems.

### Do your applications use this vulnerable package?

In a few clicks we can analyze your entire application and see what components are vulnerable in your application, and suggest you quick fixes.

Zip Slip is a widespread critical archive extraction vulnerability, allowing attackers to write arbitrary files on the system, typically resulting in remote command execution. It was discovered and responsibly disclosed by the Snyk Security team ahead of a public disclosure on 5th June 2018, and affects thousands of projects, including ones from HP, Amazon, Apache, Pivotal and many more. This page provides the most up-to-date fix statuses for the libraries and projects that were found to be exploitable or contain a vulnerable implementation.

For more information on the technical details of Zip Slip, read <http://snyk.io/research/zip-slip-vulnerability>.

The vulnerability has been found in multiple ecosystems, including JavaScript, Ruby, .NET and Go, but is especially prevalent in Java, where there is no central library offering high level processing of archive (e.g. `zip`) files. The lack of such a library led to vulnerable code snippets being hand-crafted and shared among developer communities such as [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/981578/how-to-unzip-files-recursively-in-java).

The vulnerability is exploited using a specially crafted archive that holds directory traversal filenames (e.g. `../../evil.sh`). The Zip Slip vulnerability can affect numerous archive formats, including `tar`, `jar`, `war`, `cpio`, `apk`, `rar` and `7z`.

Here is a vulnerable code example showing a `ZipEntry` path being concatenated to a destination directory without any path validation. Code similar to this has been found in many repositories across many ecosystems, including libraries which thousands of applications depend on.

```
   Enumeration<ZipEntry> entries = zip.getEntries();
   while (entries.hasMoreElements()) {
      ZipEntry e = entries.nextElement();
      File f = new File(destinationDir, e.getName());
      InputStream input = zip.getInputStream(e);
      IOUtils.copy(input, write(f));
   }
```

If you find a library or project that contains similar vulnerable code, we ask for your contribution to this repository to provide the community with the most up to date information about the Zip Slip vulnerability. To contribute, please refer to our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/snyk/zip-slip-vulnerability/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

## Affected Libraries

Many of the following affected libraries exist because their ecosystems lack high level APIs providing the basic archive management capabilities. This results in vulnerable code being shared and reused. The following table contains the list of vulnerable libraries we found during private disclosure of Zip Slip which we aim to keep up to date, with community support, going forward as more vulnerable libraries are discovered. Some libraries that do not provide the high-level API often result in vulnerable implementations also, either through people copying and pasting vulnerable private code, or writing their own vulnerable snippets.

## Defensively fixed but deemed not exploitable

Some projects were confirmed by the project maintainers that their implementation code was not vulnerable to Zip Slip. However they decided to remove or fix their implementation so that in the future, the snippets could not be copied and become vulnerable elsewhere.

## Deemed not exploitable by the maintainer (vulnerable implementation remains)

The final list of projects are those with snippets of code that still have a vulnerable implementation, but are not exploitable. It is believed that it would not be possible to attack these projects in such a way that could lead to a malicious outcome, but the vulnerable pattern of code still exists within the code base. We strongly encourage such projects to fix the implementation both to prevent its use through other functionality, or use in other projects that copy paste snippets.

## How to fix?

Upgrade `unzipper` to version 0.8.13 or higher.

## Overview

[`unzipper`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/unzipper) is an Unzip cross-platform streaming API.

Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Write via Archive Extraction (AKA "Zip Slip").

It is exploited using a specially crafted zip archive, that holds path traversal filenames. When exploited, a filename in a malicious archive is concatenated to the target extraction directory, which results in the final path ending up outside of the target folder. For instance, a zip may hold a file with a "../../file.exe" location and thus break out of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.

The following is an example of a zip archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicous file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:

```

+2018-04-15 22:04:29 ..... 19 19 good.txt

+2018-04-15 22:04:42 ..... 20 20 ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys

```

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

9.4 critical

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **High**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

  **High**

# unzipper

## Installation

```
$ npm install unzipper
```

## Open methods

The open methods allow random access to the underlying files of a zip archive, from disk or from the web, s3 or a custom source.

The open methods return a promise on the contents of the central directory of a zip file, with individual `files` listed in an array.

Each file record has the following methods, providing random access to the underlying files:

* `stream([password])` - returns a stream of the unzipped content which can be piped to any destination
* `buffer([password])` - returns a promise on the buffered content of the file.

If the file is encrypted you will have to supply a password to decrypt, otherwise you can leave blank.

Unlike `adm-zip` the Open methods will never read the entire zipfile into buffer.

The last argument to the `Open` methods is an optional `options` object where you can specify `tailSize` (default 80 bytes), i.e. how many bytes should we read at the end of the zipfile to locate the endOfCentralDirectory. This location can be variable depending on zip64 extensible data sector size. Additionally you can supply option `crx: true` which will check for a crx header and parse the file accordingly by shifting all file offsets by the length of the crx header.

### Open.file([path], [options])

Returns a Promise to the central directory information with methods to extract individual files. `start` and `end` options are used to avoid reading the whole file.

Here is a simple example of opening up a zip file, printing out the directory information and then extracting the first file inside the zipfile to disk:

```
async function main() {
  const directory = await unzipper.Open.file('path/to/archive.zip');
  console.log('directory', directory);
  return new Promise( (resolve, reject) => {
    directory.files[0]
      .stream()
      .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('firstFile'))
      .on('error',reject)
      .on('finish',resolve)
  });
}

main();
```

If you want to extract all files from the zip file, the directory object supplies an extract method. Here is a quick example:

```
async function main() {
  const directory = await unzipper.Open.file('path/to/archive.zip');
  await directory.extract({ path: '/path/to/destination' })
}
```

### Open.url([requestLibrary], [url | params], [options])

This function will return a Promise to the central directory information from a URL point to a zipfile. Range-headers are used to avoid reading the whole file. Unzipper does not ship with a request library so you will have to provide it as the first option.

Live Example: (extracts a tiny xml file from the middle of a 500MB zipfile)

```
const request = require('request');
const unzipper = require('./unzip');

async function main() {
  const directory = await unzipper.Open.url(request,'http://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2015/ZCTA5/tl_2015_us_zcta510.zip');
  const file = directory.files.find(d => d.path === 'tl_2015_us_zcta510.shp.iso.xml');
  const content = await file.buffer();
  console.log(content.toString());
}

main();
```

This function takes a second parameter which can either be a string containing the `url` to request, or an `options` object to invoke the supplied `request` library with. This can be used when other request options are required, such as custom headers or authentication to a third party service.

```
const request = require('google-oauth-jwt').requestWithJWT();

const googleStorageOptions = {
  url: `https://www.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b/m-bucket-name/o/my-object-name`,
  qs: { alt: 'media' },
  jwt: {
      email: google.storage.credentials.client_email,
      key: google.storage.credentials.private_key,
      scopes: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only']
  }
});

async function getFile(req, res, next) {
  const directory = await unzipper.Open.url(request, googleStorageOptions);
  const file = zip.files.find((file) => file.path === 'my-filename');
  return file.stream().pipe(res);
});
```

### Open.s3([aws-sdk], [params], [options])

This function will return a Promise to the central directory information from a zipfile on S3. Range-headers are used to avoid reading the whole file. Unzipper does not ship with with the aws-sdk so you have to provide an instantiated client as first arguments. The params object requires `Bucket` and `Key` to fetch the correct file.

Example:

```
const unzipper = require('./unzip');
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const s3Client = AWS.S3(config);

async function main() {
  const directory = await unzipper.Open.s3(s3Client,{Bucket: 'unzipper', Key: 'archive.zip'});
  return new Promise( (resolve, reject) => {
    directory.files[0]
      .stream()
      .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('firstFile'))
      .on('error',reject)
      .on('finish',resolve)
  });
}

main();
```

### Open.buffer(buffer, [options])

If you already have the zip file in-memory as a buffer, you can open the contents directly.

Example:

```
// never use readFileSync - only used here to simplify the example
const buffer = fs.readFileSync('path/to/arhive.zip');

async function main() {
  const directory = await unzipper.Open.buffer(buffer);
  console.log('directory',directory);
  // ...
}

main();
```

### Open.custom(source, [options])

This function can be used to provide a custom source implementation. The source parameter expects a `stream` and a `size` function to be implemented. The size function should return a `Promise` that resolves the total size of the file. The stream function should return a `Readable` stream according to the supplied offset and length parameters.

Example:

```
// Custom source implementation for reading a zip file from Google Cloud Storage
const { Storage } = require('@google-cloud/storage');

async function main() {
  const storage = new Storage();
  const bucket = storage.bucket('my-bucket');
  const zipFile = bucket.file('my-zip-file.zip');

  const customSource = {
    stream: function(offset, length) {
      return zipFile.createReadStream({
        start: offset,
        end: length && offset + length
      })
    },
    size: async function() {
      const objMetadata = (await zipFile.getMetadata())[0];
      return objMetadata.size;
    }
  };

  const directory = await unzipper.Open.custom(customSource);
  console.log('directory', directory);
  // ...
}

main();
```

### Open.[method].extract()

The directory object returned from `Open.[method]` provides an `extract` method which extracts all the files to a specified `path`, with an optional `concurrency` (default: 1).

Example (with concurrency of 5):

```
unzip.Open.file('path/to/archive.zip')
  .then(d => d.extract({path: '/extraction/path', concurrency: 5}));
```

Please note: Methods that use the Central Directory instead of parsing entire file can be found under [`Open`](#open)

Chrome extension files (.crx) are zipfiles with an [extra header](http://www.adambarth.com/experimental/crx/docs/crx.html) at the start of the file. Unzipper will parse .crx file with the streaming methods (`Parse` and `ParseOne`).

## Streaming an entire zip file (legacy)

This library began as an active fork and drop-in replacement of the [node-unzip](https://github.com/EvanOxfeld/node-unzip) to address the following issues:

* finish/close events are not always triggered, particular when the input stream is slower than the receivers
* Any files are buffered into memory before passing on to entry

Originally the only way to use the library was to stream the entire zip file. This method is inefficient if you are only interested in selected files from the zip files. Additionally this method can be error prone since it relies on the local file headers which could be wrong.

The structure of this fork is similar to the original, but uses Promises and inherit guarantees provided by node streams to ensure low memory footprint and emits finish/close events at the end of processing. The new `Parser` will push any parsed `entries` downstream if you pipe from it, while still supporting the legacy `entry` event as well.

Breaking changes: The new `Parser` will not automatically drain entries if there are no listeners or pipes in place.

Unzipper provides simple APIs similar to [node-tar](https://github.com/isaacs/node-tar) for parsing and extracting zip files.
There are no added compiled dependencies - inflation is handled by node.js's built in zlib support.

### Extract to a directory

```
fs.createReadStream('path/to/archive.zip')
  .pipe(unzipper.Extract({ path: 'output/path' }));
```

Extract emits the 'close' event once the zip's contents have been fully extracted to disk. `Extract` uses [fstream.Writer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fstream) and therefore needs an absolute path to the destination directory. This directory will be automatically created if it doesn't already exist.

### Parse zip file contents

Process each zip file entry or pipe entries to another stream.

**Important**: If you do not intend to consume an entry stream's raw data, call autodrain() to dispose of the entry's
contents. Otherwise the stream will halt. `.autodrain()` returns an empty stream that provides `error` and `finish` events.
Additionally you can call `.autodrain().promise()` to get the promisified version of success or failure of the autodrain.

```
// If you want to handle autodrain errors you can either:
entry.autodrain().catch(e => handleError);
// or
entry.autodrain().on('error' => handleError);
```

Here is a quick example:

```
fs.createReadStream('path/to/archive.zip')
  .pipe(unzipper.Parse())
  .on('entry', function (entry) {
    const fileName = entry.path;
    const type = entry.type; // 'Directory' or 'File'
    const size = entry.vars.uncompressedSize; // There is also compressedSize;
    if (fileName === "this IS the file I'm looking for") {
      entry.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('output/path'));
    } else {
      entry.autodrain();
    }
  });
```

and the same example using async iterators:

```
const zip = fs.createReadStream('path/to/archive.zip').pipe(unzipper.Parse({forceStream: true}));
for await (const entry of zip) {
  const fileName = entry.path;
  const type = entry.type; // 'Directory' or 'File'
  const size = entry.vars.uncompressedSize; // There is also compressedSize;
  if (fileName === "this IS the file I'm looking for") {
    entry.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('output/path'));
  } else {
    entry.autodrain();
  }
}
```

### Parse zip by piping entries downstream

If you `pipe` from unzipper the downstream components will receive each `entry` for further processing. This allows for clean pipelines transforming zipfiles into unzipped data.

Example using `stream.Transform`:

```
fs.createReadStream('path/to/archive.zip')
  .pipe(unzipper.Parse())
  .pipe(stream.Transform({
    objectMode: true,
    transform: function(entry,e,cb) {
      const fileName = entry.path;
      const type = entry.type; // 'Directory' or 'File'
      const size = entry.vars.uncompressedSize; // There is also compressedSize;
      if (fileName === "this IS the file I'm looking for") {
        entry.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('output/path'))
          .on('finish',cb);
      } else {
        entry.autodrain();
        cb();
      }
    }
  }
  }));
```

Example using [etl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/etl):

```
fs.createReadStream('path/to/archive.zip')
  .pipe(unzipper.Parse())
  .pipe(etl.map(entry => {
    if (entry.path == "this IS the file I'm looking for")
      return entry
        .pipe(etl.toFile('output/path'))
        .promise();
    else
      entry.autodrain();
  }))
```

### Parse a single file and pipe contents

`unzipper.parseOne([regex])` is a convenience method that unzips only one file from the archive and pipes the contents down (not the entry itself). If no search criteria is specified, the first file in the archive will be unzipped. Otherwise, each filename will be compared to the criteria and the first one to match will be unzipped and piped down. If no file matches then the the stream will end without any content.

Example:

```
fs.createReadStream('path/to/archive.zip')
  .pipe(unzipper.ParseOne())
  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('firstFile.txt'));
```

### Buffering the content of an entry into memory

While the recommended strategy of consuming the unzipped contents is using streams, it is sometimes convenient to be able to get the full buffered contents of each file . Each `entry` provides a `.buffer` function that consumes the entry by buffering the contents into memory and returning a promise to the complete buffer.

```
fs.createReadStream('path/to/archive.zip')
  .pipe(unzipper.Parse())
  .pipe(etl.map(async entry => {
    if (entry.path == "this IS the file I'm looking for") {
      const content = await entry.buffer();
      await fs.writeFile('output/path',content);
    }
    else {
      entry.autodrain();
    }
  }))
```

### Parse.promise() syntax sugar

The parser emits `finish` and `error` events like any other stream. The parser additionally provides a promise wrapper around those two events to allow easy folding into existing Promise-based structures.

Example:

```
fs.createReadStream('path/to/archive.zip')
  .pipe(unzipper.Parse())
  .on('entry', entry => entry.autodrain())
  .promise()
  .then( () => console.log('done'), e => console.log('error',e));
```

### Parse zip created by DOS ZIP or Windows ZIP Folders

Archives created by legacy tools usually have filenames encoded with IBM PC (Windows OEM) character set.
You can decode filenames with preferred character set:

```
const il = require('iconv-lite');
fs.createReadStream('path/to/archive.zip')
  .pipe(unzipper.Parse())
  .on('entry', function (entry) {
    // if some legacy zip tool follow ZIP spec then this flag will be set
    const isUnicode = entry.props.flags.isUnicode;
    // decode "non-unicode" filename from OEM Cyrillic character set
    const fileName = isUnicode ? entry.path : il.decode(entry.props.pathBuffer, 'cp866');
    const type = entry.type; // 'Directory' or 'File'
    const size = entry.vars.uncompressedSize; // There is also compressedSize;
    if (fileName === "Текстовый файл.txt") {
      entry.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(fileName));
    } else {
      entry.autodrain();
    }
  });
```

### @aviadatsnyk **[aviadatsnyk](/aviadatsnyk)** commented [Apr 16, 2018](#issue-314618847) • edited Loading

## Why this PR?

This PR is meant to fix an arbitrary file write vulnerability, that can be achieved using a specially crafted zip archive, that holds path traversal filenames. When the filename gets concatenated to the target extraction directory, the final path ends up outside of the target folder.

A sample malicious zip file named zip-slip.zip. (see [this gist](https://gist.github.com/grnd/2992cc4d968386ae277123bad9e7f00a)) was used, and when running the code below, resulted in creation of `evil.txt` file in /tmp folder.

```
fs.createReadStream('zip-slip.zip').pipe(unzipper.Extract({ path: '/tmp/safe' }));
```

There are various possible ways to avoid this issue, some include checking for `..` (dot dot) characters in the filename, but the best solution in our opinion is to check if the final target filename, starts with the target folder (after both are resolved to their absolute path).

Stay secure,

Snyk Team

This should either throw an error or at the very least show a warning.

Also the `entry` is left hanging here as nothing drains it (possibly use .autodrain)

| Hi there, I ended up using the code snippet above to add zip-slip protection to some of my manual unzipping methods that use this library. And I noticed that on my linux docker image it failed to detect the [windows zip-slip archive](https://github.com/snyk/zip-slip-vulnerability/blob/master/archives/zip-slip-win.zip).  I am using the following and it catches both of the examples from synk on windows and linux docker images (did not try mac)  ``` const DUMMY_PATH = path.join('/sandbox'); const extractPath = path.join(DUMMY_PATH, zipEntry.path.replace(/\\/g, '/')); if (extractPath.indexOf(DUMMY_PATH) !== 0) {   return true; } ``` |

| I was looking at it some more, I don't think UNIX machines are actually vulnerable to the windows zip. But I think it will end up creating a rather strange filename "................\tempevil.txt". Should we still go ahead and make the change to ignore something that is obviously attempting to do something bad? |

| Thanks [@glen-nicol](https://github.com/glen-nicol) I ran tests against the [windows zip-slip archive](https://github.com/snyk/zip-slip-vulnerability/blob/master/archives/zip-slip-win.zip) on a windows machine and the file was safely ignored there. Ideally we should want same behavior independent of platform so the preference here would be to ignore. But I'm happy that this is not actual vulnerability |

# ADM-ZIP for NodeJS

ADM-ZIP is a pure JavaScript implementation for zip data compression for [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/).

[![Build Status](https://github.com/cthackers/adm-zip/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cthackers/adm-zip/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
# Installation

With [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) do:

```
$ npm install adm-zip

```

**Electron** file system support described below.

## What is it good for?

The library allows you to:

* decompress zip files directly to disk or in memory buffers
* compress files and store them to disk in .zip format or in compressed buffers
* update content of/add new/delete files from an existing .zip

# Dependencies

There are no other nodeJS libraries that ADM-ZIP is dependent of

# Examples

## Basic usage

```
var AdmZip = require("adm-zip");

// reading archives
var zip = new AdmZip("./my_file.zip");
