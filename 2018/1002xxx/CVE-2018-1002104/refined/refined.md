Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2018-1002104:

**Summary:**
The pull request #3125, "[404-server] Conceal /metrics and /healthz behind port 10254," within the kubernetes/ingress-nginx repository is directly linked to CVE-2018-1002104. The vulnerability stems from the default backend's (404-server) exposure of metrics and health check endpoints without proper access control. This PR aims to mitigate that by moving the `/metrics` endpoint to a different port (10254) and keeping `/healthz` on port 8080.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The default backend server was exposing its `/metrics` and `/healthz` endpoints on the same port as the main application, making them publicly accessible without any authentication or authorization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Access Control:** The primary vulnerability was the lack of access control on the `/metrics` and `/healthz` endpoints of the default backend. This allowed anyone with network access to the server to potentially gain sensitive information through the `/metrics` endpoint or cause denial of service through the `/healthz` endpoint.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The `/metrics` endpoint could expose internal operational details of the server, which could be used by an attacker for reconnaissance.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Although not explicitly stated, the public exposure of `/healthz` could potentially be exploited to cause a denial of service if an attacker were to continuously ping the endpoint.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** Any entity with network access to the default backend server could exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the default backend's exposed port to access the vulnerable endpoints.

**Mitigation:**

The pull request addresses the vulnerability by implementing the following changes:

*   **Port Separation:** The `/metrics` endpoint is moved to a different port (10254 by default). This makes it less accessible to external users.
*   **Graceful Shutdown Timeout:** A timeout for graceful shutdown is implemented (default 5s).
*   The `/healthz` endpoint is kept at port 8080.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The discussion in the PR also touches on whether the default backend should even expose metrics and that the 404-server image was also used in other projects (specifically, GKE ingress controller)
*   The vulnerability was ultimately addressed by making the metrics endpoint accessible on a different port and requiring additional configuration.
