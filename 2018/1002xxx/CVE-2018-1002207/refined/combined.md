#### Introduced: 13 Apr 2018

[CVE-2018-1002207  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-1002207) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-29  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/29.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `github.com/mholt/archiver/cmd/archiver` to version e4ef56d48eb029648b0e895bb0b6a393ef0829c3 or higher.

## Overview

[`github.com/mholt/archiver/cmd/archiver`](https://github.com/mholt/archiver) makes it trivially easy to make and extract common archive formats such as .zip, and .tar.gz. Simply name the input and output file(s).

Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Write via Archive Extraction (AKA "Zip Slip").

It is exploited using a specially crafted zip archive, that holds path traversal filenames. When exploited, a filename in a malicious archive is concatenated to the target extraction directory, which results in the final path ending up outside of the target folder. For instance, a zip may hold a file with a "../../file.exe" location and thus break out of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.

The following is an example of a zip archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicous file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:

```

+2018-04-15 22:04:29 ..... 19 19 good.txt

+2018-04-15 22:04:42 ..... 20 20 ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys

```

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

5.5 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker's path is via read/write/execute capabilities.

  **Local**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited. For example, a successful exploit may only be possible during the installation of an application by a system administrator.

  **Required**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **High**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**

### @aviadatsnyk **[aviadatsnyk](/aviadatsnyk)** commented [Apr 17, 2018](#issue-315106655)

## Why this PR?

This PR is meant to fix an arbitrary file write vulnerability, that can be achieved using a specially crafted zip archive, that holds path traversal filenames. When the filename gets concatenated to the target extraction directory, the final path ends up outside of the target folder.

A sample malicious zip file named zip-slip.zip. (see [this gist](https://gist.github.com/grnd/2992cc4d968386ae277123bad9e7f00a)) was used, and when running the code below, resulted in creation of `evil.txt` file in /tmp folder.

```
package main

import "log"
import "github.com/mholt/archiver"

func main() {
	err := archiver.Tar.Open("/tmp/evil-tar.tar", "/tmp/safe")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
```

There are various possible ways to avoid this issue, some include checking for `..` (dot dot) characters in the filename, but the best solution in our opinion is to check if the final target filename, starts with the target folder (after both are resolved to their absolute path).

Stay secure,

Snyk Team

| I'll add a test next week, but if you can't wait, the idea is to extract the `zip-slip.zip` malicious zip file, and make sure a file `/tmp/evil.txt` was **not** created. I'm not sure how to do it in a way that would work for windows et. al. |

Thanks! I have just one request, that we consolidate all the zip-slip logic into a single function which we then call from the individual extractors.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Do you think this logic could be pulled into its own function so that we don't have to repeat it everywhere? It's simple, I know, but it would be nice to standardize it.

Took a stab at it. Let me know what you think.

I'm not sure about the name `sanitizeExtractPath`, so if you have any idea - that could be great.

| The fix is insufficient because you can use symlinks in `.tar` files to get around it. The following PoC creates a symlink `root` and then tars it with a file that is referenced through that symlink. Upon unpacking it will first unpack the symlink, which will now point to the root filesystem, and then the second file can use it to write anywhere.  ``` /tmp/zip $ ln -s / root /tmp/zip $ echo oops > /tmp/ohoh /tmp/zip $ tar -cf test.tar root/ root/tmp/ohoh /tmp/zip $ tar -tf test.tar root root/tmp/ohoh /tmp/zip $ rm /tmp/ohoh /tmp/zip $ cat test.go package main  import "github.com/mholt/archiver"  func main() {     archiver.Tar.Open("test.tar", "test_out") }  /tmp/zip $ ls /tmp/ohoh ls: /tmp/ohoh: No such file or directory /tmp/zip $ go run test.go /tmp/zip $ ls /tmp/ohoh /tmp/ohoh /tmp/zip $ cat /tmp/ohoh oops  ```  I'm not sure what a good fix would be, as symlinks are a feature of `.tar` files. And it could break existing projects that rely on symlinks. Maybe a flag to enable symlinks would make sense, and have it off by default?  PS: Symlinks are theoretically also supported by `.zip` files, but archiver doesn't implement it (actually many zip libraries don't support them). So in case this support would be added in the future, this has to be considered as well.  edit: sorry, just noticed that there is already an open issue about that [#69](https://github.com/mholt/archiver/issues/69) |

# Zip Slip Vulnerability

Zip Slip is a widespread arbitrary file overwrite critical vulnerability, which typically results in remote command execution. It was discovered and responsibly disclosed by the Snyk Security team ahead of a public disclosure on 5th June 2018, and affects thousands of projects, including ones from HP, Amazon, Apache, Pivotal and  [many more (CVEs and full list here).](https://github.com/snyk/zip-slip-vulnerability)  Of course, this type of vulnerability has existed before, but recently it has manifested itself in a much larger number of projects and libraries.

![Zip Slip](https://res.cloudinary.com/snyk/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,c_thumb,h_225,w_225/v1527156415/research/zipslip.png)

The vulnerability has been found in multiple ecosystems, including JavaScript, Ruby, .NET and Go, but is especially prevalent in Java, where there is no central library offering high level processing of archive (e.g. zip) files. The lack of such a library led to vulnerable code snippets being hand crafted and shared among developer communities such as  [StackOverflow.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/981578/how-to-unzip-files-recursively-in-java)

The vulnerability is exploited using a specially crafted archive that holds directory traversal filenames (e.g. ../../evil.sh). The Zip Slip vulnerability can affect numerous archive formats, including tar, jar, war, cpio, apk, rar and 7z. If you’d like the information on this page in a downloadable technical white paper, click the button below.

 [Download Technical White Paper](https://res.cloudinary.com/snyk/image/upload/v1528192501/zip-slip-vulnerability/technical-whitepaper.pdf)

Zip Slip is a form of directory traversal that can be exploited by extracting files from an archive. The premise of the directory traversal vulnerability is that an attacker can gain access to parts of the file system outside of the target folder in which they should reside. The attacker can then overwrite executable files and either invoke them remotely or wait for the system or user to call them, thus achieving remote command execution on the victim’s machine. The vulnerability can also cause damage by overwriting configuration files or other sensitive resources, and can be exploited on both client (user) machines and servers.

##### Exploitable Application Flow

The two parts required to exploit this vulnerability is a malicious archive and extraction code that does not perform validation checking. Let’s look through each of these in turn. First of all, the contents of the zip file needs to have one or more files that break out of the target directory when extracted. In the example below, we can see the contents of a zip file. It has two files, a good.sh file which would be extracted into the target directory and an evil.sh file which is trying to traverse up the directory tree to hit the root and then add a file into the tmp directory. When you attempt to cd .. in the root directory, you still find yourself in the root directory, so a malicious path could contain many levels of ../ to stand a better chance of reaching the root directory, before trying to traverse to sensitive files.

```
  5 Tue Jun 5 11:04:29 BST 2018 good.sh 20 Tue Jun 5 11:04:42 BST 2018 ../../../../../../../../tmp/evil.sh
```

The contents of this zip file have to be hand crafted. Archive creation tools don’t typically allow users to add files with these paths, despite the zip specification allowing it. However, with the right tools, it’s easy to create files with these paths.

 The second thing you’ll need to exploit this vulnerability is to extract the archive, either using your own code or a library. The vulnerability exists when the extraction code omits validation on the file paths in the archive. An example of a vulnerable code snippet (example shown in Java) can be seen below.

```
  1   Enumeration<ZipEntry>entries = zip.getEntries();
  2   while (entries.hasMoreElements()) {
  3       ZipEntry e = entries.nextElement();
  4       File f = new File(destinationDir, e.getName());
  5       InputStream input = zip.getInputStream(e);
  6       IOUtils.copy(input, write(f));
  7   }
```

You can see on line 4, e.getName() is concatenated with the target directory, dir, without being validated. At this point, when our zip archive gets to our evil.sh, it will append the full path (including every ../) of the zip entry to the target directory resulting in evil.sh being written outside of the target directory.

 To see Zip Slip in action,  [watch us exploit the vulnerable java-goof application](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1MT5lr4p9o)  , a sample application used to show many known vulnerabilities.

##### Are you Vulnerable?

You are vulnerable if you are either using a library which contains the Zip Slip vulnerability or your project directly contains vulnerable code, which extracts files from an archive without the necessary directory traversal validation. Snyk is maintaining a [GitHub repository listing all](https://github.com/snyk/zip-slip-vulnerability) projects that have been found vulnerable to Zip Slip and have been responsibly disclosed to, including fix dates and versions. The repository is open to contributions from the wider community to ensure it holds the most up to date status.s.

##### What action should you take?

Here are some steps you can take to check if your project’s dependencies of code contain the Zip Slip vulnerability:

##### 1. Search through your projects for vulnerable code.

JavaGroovyJavaScript.NETGoRuby & Python
##### 2. Add Zip Slip Security Testing to your application build pipeline

If you’d prefer not to search through your direct and transitive dependencies (of which you likely have hundreds) to determine if you’re using a vulnerable library, you can choose a dependency vulnerability scanning tool, like Snyk. It’s a good practice to add security testing into your development lifecycle stages, such as during development, CI, deployment and production. You can test your own projects (all the ecosystems mentioned above are supported) to determine if they are vulnerable to Zip Slip.

##### Other vulnerable projects

Vulnerable projects include projects in various ecosystems that either use the libraries mentioned above or directly include vulnerable code. Of the many thousands of projects that have contained similar vulnerable code samples or accessed vulnerable libraries, the most significant include: Oracle, Amazon, Spring/Pivotal, Linkedin, Twitter, Alibaba, Jenkinsci, Eclipse, OWASP, SonarQube, OpenTable, Arduino, ElasticSearch, Selenium, JetBrains and Google.

##### Thank you!

The Snyk security team would like for thank all the vendors, project owners and the community members that helped raise awareness, find and fix vulnerabilities in projects across many ecosystems.

### Do your applications use this vulnerable package?

In a few clicks we can analyze your entire application and see what components are vulnerable in your application, and suggest you quick fixes.

Zip Slip is a widespread critical archive extraction vulnerability, allowing attackers to write arbitrary files on the system, typically resulting in remote command execution. It was discovered and responsibly disclosed by the Snyk Security team ahead of a public disclosure on 5th June 2018, and affects thousands of projects, including ones from HP, Amazon, Apache, Pivotal and many more. This page provides the most up-to-date fix statuses for the libraries and projects that were found to be exploitable or contain a vulnerable implementation.

For more information on the technical details of Zip Slip, read <http://snyk.io/research/zip-slip-vulnerability>.

The vulnerability has been found in multiple ecosystems, including JavaScript, Ruby, .NET and Go, but is especially prevalent in Java, where there is no central library offering high level processing of archive (e.g. `zip`) files. The lack of such a library led to vulnerable code snippets being hand-crafted and shared among developer communities such as [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/981578/how-to-unzip-files-recursively-in-java).

The vulnerability is exploited using a specially crafted archive that holds directory traversal filenames (e.g. `../../evil.sh`). The Zip Slip vulnerability can affect numerous archive formats, including `tar`, `jar`, `war`, `cpio`, `apk`, `rar` and `7z`.

Here is a vulnerable code example showing a `ZipEntry` path being concatenated to a destination directory without any path validation. Code similar to this has been found in many repositories across many ecosystems, including libraries which thousands of applications depend on.

```
   Enumeration<ZipEntry> entries = zip.getEntries();
   while (entries.hasMoreElements()) {
      ZipEntry e = entries.nextElement();
      File f = new File(destinationDir, e.getName());
      InputStream input = zip.getInputStream(e);
      IOUtils.copy(input, write(f));
   }
```

If you find a library or project that contains similar vulnerable code, we ask for your contribution to this repository to provide the community with the most up to date information about the Zip Slip vulnerability. To contribute, please refer to our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/snyk/zip-slip-vulnerability/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

## Affected Libraries

Many of the following affected libraries exist because their ecosystems lack high level APIs providing the basic archive management capabilities. This results in vulnerable code being shared and reused. The following table contains the list of vulnerable libraries we found during private disclosure of Zip Slip which we aim to keep up to date, with community support, going forward as more vulnerable libraries are discovered. Some libraries that do not provide the high-level API often result in vulnerable implementations also, either through people copying and pasting vulnerable private code, or writing their own vulnerable snippets.

## Defensively fixed but deemed not exploitable

Some projects were confirmed by the project maintainers that their implementation code was not vulnerable to Zip Slip. However they decided to remove or fix their implementation so that in the future, the snippets could not be copied and become vulnerable elsewhere.

## Deemed not exploitable by the maintainer (vulnerable implementation remains)

The final list of projects are those with snippets of code that still have a vulnerable implementation, but are not exploitable. It is believed that it would not be possible to attack these projects in such a way that could lead to a malicious outcome, but the vulnerable pattern of code still exists within the code base. We strongly encourage such projects to fix the implementation both to prevent its use through other functionality, or use in other projects that copy paste snippets.
