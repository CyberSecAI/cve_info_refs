Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1002002:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization of the `filter_email` parameter within the `bft_list.html.php` file of the Arigato Autoresponder and Newsletter WordPress plugin. Specifically, the value of the `filter_email` parameter, which is obtained from the `$_GET` array, is directly echoed into an HTML input field's `value` attribute without any encoding or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `filter_email` GET parameter. When a user with administrative privileges visits the crafted URL, the injected script will be executed in their browser within the context of the vulnerable website.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of an administrator's browser session. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing session cookies to impersonate the administrator.
    *   **Defacement:** Modifying the content of the website.
    *   **Phishing:** Redirecting the user to a malicious website to steal credentials or other sensitive information.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Creating new admin accounts or modifying existing user permissions.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Injecting scripts that attempt to download and execute malware on the victim's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code within the `filter_email` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
*   The attacker needs to entice an administrator to visit the malicious link while logged in.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `bft_list.html.php` at line 28:
    ```php
    <div><label><?php _e('Filter by email', 'broadfast')?>:</label> <input type="text" name="filter_email" value="<?php echo @$_GET['filter_email']?>"></div>
    ```
*   The vulnerability occurs because the value of `$_GET['filter_email']` is directly inserted into the HTML without any form of output encoding or sanitization.
*   The exploit can be triggered by crafting a URL such as: `http://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=bft_list&filter_email=<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
