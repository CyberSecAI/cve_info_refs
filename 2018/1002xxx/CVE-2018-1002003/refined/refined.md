Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details for CVE-2018-1002003:

**CVE-2018-1002003**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `filter_name` parameter within the `bft_list.html.php` file.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The `filter_name` parameter, taken from the GET request, is directly output into the HTML without proper encoding or sanitization.
    ```html
    <input type="text" name="filter_name" value="<?php echo @$_GET['filter_name']?>">
    ```
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `filter_name` parameter. When a user with administrative privileges accesses the affected page, the injected script will execute in their browser, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Admin account takeover
    *   Defacement of the WordPress site
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Other malicious activities within the context of the administrator's browser session.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack is carried out through a crafted URL containing the malicious JavaScript code in the `filter_name` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload.
    *   The attacker needs to trick an administrator into clicking the malicious link or have the administrator visit the page with the manipulated URL
    *   The attacker does not require direct access to the server

**Summary**

CVE-2018-1002003 describes a reflected XSS vulnerability in the Arigato Autoresponder and Newsletter WordPress plugin. It is caused by the lack of sanitization on the `filter_name` GET parameter in the `bft_list.html.php` file, which allows for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed when an administrator views the page. An attacker would need to craft a malicious URL and trick an administrator into clicking it to execute the malicious script in their browser session.
