Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-1002102

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from improper validation of URL redirects in the Kubernetes API server. Specifically, an attacker-controlled Kubelet can return an arbitrary redirect when the API server requests streaming endpoints.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Unvalidated Redirect:** The core issue is the lack of validation on redirect URLs returned by the Kubelet. The API server blindly follows these redirects.
*   **Client-Cert Credentials Exposure**: The API server uses client-certificate credentials when authenticating to the Kubelet. This means that if the redirect sent by the attacker-controlled Kubelet points to a malicious server, the credentials will be sent to it.
*   **Reliance on Feature Flags**: The presence of this vulnerability is also determined by the status of two feature flags `StreamingProxyRedirects` and `ValidateProxyRedirects`.  If `StreamingProxyRedirects` is enabled and `ValidateProxyRedirects` is disabled, the API server is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Credential Exposure:** An attacker can potentially steal the API server's client certificate credentials by redirecting the API server to a malicious endpoint.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:** By redirecting to an attacker-controlled server, the attacker could intercept requests intended for the Kubelet.  This could be used for data exfiltration, or to inject malicious responses.
*   **Potential for Further Compromise:** While the immediate impact is the potential exposure of client-cert credentials, this could be a stepping stone to more severe attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have control over a Kubelet that is accessible by the API server.
*   **Malicious Kubelet Response:** The attack is triggered when the Kubelet returns a specially crafted HTTP redirect response.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Compromised Kubelet:** The attacker needs to have compromised or control a Kubelet within the cluster.
*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker must be positioned such that the API server attempts to communicate with the attacker-controlled Kubelet.
*   **Knowledge of Affected Configurations:** The attacker must know if the cluster has the vulnerable configuration ie `StreamingProxyRedirects` is enabled and `ValidateProxyRedirects` disabled.

**Mitigation:**
*   **Enable `ValidateProxyRedirects`:** This feature, when enabled, will cause the kube-apiserver to check that redirects go to the same host, preventing the described attack. This feature is enabled by default in Kubernetes v1.14 and later.
*   **Disable `StreamingProxyRedirects` (Long Term):** The long term plan is to deprecate the  `StreamingProxyRedirects` feature and handle the redirection within the Kubelet to avoid this issue completely.
*   **Kubelet Configuration:** It is suggested to set `--redirect-container-streaming=false` on the kubelet to avoid issues if `ValidateProxyRedirects` is temporarily disabled.

**Additional Notes:**

*   API servers using SSH tunnels (--ssh-user / --ssh-keyfile) are not affected.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Alban Crequy.

**Summary**

This CVE describes a vulnerability where a malicious Kubelet can redirect the API server to an attacker-controlled host due to a lack of validation of the redirect URL. The vulnerability was present when `StreamingProxyRedirects` was enabled and `ValidateProxyRedirects` was not enabled.  This allows for an attacker to potentially steal the API server's client-cert credentials, and perform a man in the middle attack. It was fixed by enabling `ValidateProxyRedirects` which validates the redirects to ensure they are not redirected to another host.
