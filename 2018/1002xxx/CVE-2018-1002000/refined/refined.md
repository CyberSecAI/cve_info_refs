Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2018-1002000:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection.
- The `del_ids` variable received via a POST request is not sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The unsanitized `del_ids` parameter allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query, which is then executed by the database. This is "blind" because the attacker does not see the direct output of the query but can infer results based on the application's behavior (e.g., time-based).
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize the user-supplied `del_ids` input before incorporating it into a SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, which could include sensitive information such as user credentials, emails, and other data.
- An attacker can modify or delete data from the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is performed via a POST request to the `wp-admin/admin.php` endpoint, specifically targeting the `bft_list` page.
- The malicious SQL code is injected through the `del_ids` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrative Privileges:** The exploit requires administrative privileges within the WordPress instance.
- **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the target WordPress instance.
- The attacker needs to know the correct nonce to make the request valid.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerable code is located in `controllers/list.php` at line 66 (`$wpdb->query("DELETE FROM ".BFT_USERS." WHERE id IN (".$_POST['del_ids'].")");`).
- The exploit code provided uses `sqlmap` to demonstrate the vulnerability using a time-based blind SQL injection technique to confirm the vulnerability.
