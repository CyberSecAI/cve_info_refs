Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2018-1002004:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization of the `sdate` parameter within the `bft_list.html.php` file of the Arigato Autoresponder and Newsletter WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin directly outputs the value of the `sdate` GET parameter into an input field without proper sanitization or encoding. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the input field.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to:
  - Stealing user cookies
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites
  - Defacing the website
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user
  - Other malicious activities that JavaScript can execute.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious URL:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL with a payload in the `sdate` parameter. This URL is then sent to a victim (e.g., via email or social media).
- **Social Engineering:** An attacker tricks the victim into clicking the malicious link, thereby injecting the XSS payload when the victim loads the page.
- **Third-party website:** An attacker could inject an iframe into a third party web page that has this malicious link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with a JavaScript payload.
- The attacker needs to be able to convince the victim to click on the malicious URL, which requires social engineering tactics or using a compromised website to host the link.
- The targeted user needs to be an administrator, since this vulnerability requires administrative privileges to access the affected page.

**Additional Information**
- The specific vulnerable code is located at `bft_list.html.php:42`:
  ```html
  <input type="text" class="bftDatePicker" name="sdate" id="bftSignupDate" value="<?php echo empty($_GET['sdate']) ? '' : $_GET['sdate']?>">
  ```
- The provided information confirms that the vulnerability exists within the Arigato Autoresponder and Newsletter plugin.
- The vulnerability is a reflected XSS vulnerability.
- The vulnerability requires administrative privileges to exploit.
