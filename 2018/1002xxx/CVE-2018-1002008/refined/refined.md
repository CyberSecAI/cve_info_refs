Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-1002008:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability occurs because the `$_GET['ob']` and `$_GET['offset']` parameters are not sanitized before being included in the HTML output within the `list-user.html.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** The plugin reflects user-supplied input (`ob` and `offset` parameters from the URL) directly into the HTML output without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers could steal cookies or session tokens.
*   **Phishing:** Redirect users to malicious sites.
*   **Defacement:** Modify the content of the page viewed by other users.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Redirect users to sites containing malware.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript code within the `ob` or `offset` parameters.
*   The attacker would need to trick a user into clicking the crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need any special privileges, but they do need to be able to convince a user with administrative privileges to click on a malicious link.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is found in `list-user.html.php` at line 4:
    ```php
    <p><a href="admin.php?page=bft_list&ob=<?php echo $_GET['ob']?>&offset=<?php echo $_GET['offset']?>"><?php _e('Back to all subscribers', 'broadfast');?></a></p>
    ```
* The vulnerability exists because `$_GET['ob']` and `$_GET['offset']` are directly echoed into the HTML without sanitization.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability requires administrative privileges to exploit. However, this does not mean that the exploit can be triggered by the user with administrative privileges itself. It still requires a malicious link to be clicked by the administrator.
* The provided text also lists multiple other vulnerabilities, including SQL injection and other XSS issues, in the same plugin, but these are covered by different CVEs.
