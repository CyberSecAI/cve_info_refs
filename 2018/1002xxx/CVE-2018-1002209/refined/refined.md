    "information": "The provided content contains information about CVE-2018-1002209, which is related to the Zip Slip vulnerability found in the `quazip` library.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of file paths during archive extraction. Specifically, the `JlCompress::extractDir()` function in `quazip` concatenates the file name from a ZIP archive with a destination directory without proper sanitization or checks, allowing directory traversal.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n-  The code doesn't validate or sanitize filenames within the archive before creating files on the filesystem. Specifically it lacks checks for directory traversal sequences such as \"../\".\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n-   An attacker can write arbitrary files on the system, potentially overwriting existing files outside of the intended target directory. This can lead to remote code execution by overwriting executable files or configuration files and can be exploited on both client and server machines.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n-   The attack vector is a specially crafted ZIP archive containing entries with filenames that include directory traversal sequences such as `../../evil.sh`.\n- The attacker needs to have a way to get the vulnerable application to extract the malicious archive. This could be done through a file upload feature, a downloaded file etc.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- An attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted zip file, and have a position where they can influence the vulnerable application to extract it."
