    "related": true,
    "details": [
      {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper validation of file paths within a zip archive during extraction. Specifically, the `ZipEntry.Extract` method in `DotNetZip` does not sanitize file paths, allowing an attacker to craft a zip archive containing entries with path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../evil.txt`). When extracted, these paths can write files outside the intended target directory.",
        "vulnerabilities": [
          "Arbitrary File Write",
          "Path Traversal",
          "Zip Slip"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker can overwrite existing files or create new files in arbitrary locations on the file system, leading to potential remote code execution if executable files are overwritten. Configuration files or other sensitive resources can also be overwritten, which can cause further damage.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "A specially crafted zip archive with path traversal filenames.",

      {
       "root_cause": "The `ZipEntry.Extract` method does not sanitize paths allowing directory traversal via a crafted zip file. The vulnerability exists when extraction code omits validation on the file paths in the archive.",

          "Zip Slip vulnerability allowing arbitrary file overwrite",
           "Directory traversal"
        ],
        "impact": "Attackers can gain access to parts of the file system outside of the target folder. The attacker can overwrite executable files and either invoke them remotely or wait for the system or user to call them, thus achieving remote command execution. Overwriting configuration files or other sensitive resources is also possible.",

          "A malicious zip archive with directory traversal filenames is extracted without validation."
        ],
         "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious zip archive containing files with path traversal filenames such as `../../evil.sh`, and the application must extract the archive using a vulnerable version of `DotNetZip`."
