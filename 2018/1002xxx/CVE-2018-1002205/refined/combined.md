## How to fix?

Upgrade `dotnetzip` to version 1.11.0 or higher.

## Overview

[`dotnetzip`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DotNetZip/) is a class library and toolset for manipulating zip files.

Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Write via Archive Extraction (AKA "Zip Slip").

It is exploited using a specially crafted zip archive, that holds path traversal filenames. When exploited, a filename in a malicious archive is concatenated to the target extraction directory, which results in the final path ending up outside of the target folder. For instance, a zip may hold a file with a "../../file.exe" location and thus break out of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.

The following is an example of a zip archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicous file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:

```

+2018-04-15 22:04:29 ..... 19 19 good.txt

+2018-04-15 22:04:42 ..... 20 20 ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys

```

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

5.5 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker's path is via read/write/execute capabilities.

  **Local**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited. For example, a successful exploit may only be possible during the installation of an application by a system administrator.

  **Required**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **High**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

## Introducing the DotNetZip Library and Tools

DotNetZip is the name of an open-source project that delivers a .NET
library for handling ZIP files, and some associated tools.

* The library allows .NET programmers to build applications
  that read, create and modify ZIP files.
* The tools are .NET programs that rely on the library, and can be used
  by anyone on any Windows machine to build or extract ZIP files.

## How to build?

`bundle && rake`

CI: <https://ci.appveyor.com/project/haf/dotnetzip-semverd>

## Why DotNetZip?

The Microsoft .NET Framework base class library lacks a good set of
built-in classes for creating and reading ZIP files, and Windows itself
lacks full-powered built-in ZIP tools. DotNetZip fills those needs.

There are other ZIP libraries available, but some of them have licenses
that may be unfriendly, some of them are too hard to use or not powerful
enough, and some of them are too expensive (not free). DotNetZip
provides one more alternative. The goals for this alternative:

* easy to adopt - low cost (Free), and a friendly license
* fully-featured
* good performance - in speed and compression
* easy to use.

## DotNetZip background

Many people seem to think, incorrectly, that the classes in the
System.IO.Compression namespace, like GZipStream or DeflateStream, can
create or read zip files. Not true.

The System.IO.Compression namespace, available starting with .NET v2.0
for the desktop Framework and v3.5 for the Compact Framework, includes
base class libraries supporting compression within streams - both the
Deflate and Gzip formats are supported. But these classes are not
directly useful for creating compressed ZIP archives. GZIP is not
ZIP. Deflate is not ZIP. The GZipStream in System.IO.Compression is
able to read and write GZIP streams, but that is not the same as reading
or writing a zip file. Also, these classes deliver poor compression in
practice, especially with binary data, or previously-compressed data.

Yes, it is possible to read and write zip files, using the classes in
the .NET Framework.

* You can do it with the System.IO.Packaging.ZipPackage class, added
  in .NET v3.0. Actually this class lets you create a package file,
  which is a zipfile with a particular internal structure. It includes
  a manifest and some other things. But the interface is odd and
  confusing if all you want is a regular-old ZIP file. Also, the
  classes in this namespace do not provide control for things like
  passwords, comments, AES encryption, ZIP64, Unicode, and so on.
* You can also create and read zip files with the J# runtime. This
  also has its drawbacks. First, J# is going out of support, or may
  be out of support now. Second, the J# runtime is huge, and you have
  to swallow the whole thing, even if all you want is zip file
  capability. Also, the J# runtime is based on the java.util.zip
  classes from Java v1.4, dating from 1998. The runtime hasn't been
  updated in years and still includes bugs in zip file handling. It
  lacks support for AES, for ZIP64, and Unicode. It is not accessible
  from COM. Finally, the zip classes in the J# runtime are decidedly
  un-dotnet. There's no support for events, or enumerators to let you
  do things like For Each in VB, or foreach in C#. The interface is
  clunky. It does not feel like a .NET class library, because it isn't
  a .NET class library. So for all those reasons, J# isn't ideal.
* You can also rely on P/Invoke to the shell32.dll, and the
  ShellClass. This works in a limited fashion. The drawbacks here: it
  isn't documented. It isn't a very intuitive or powerful programming
  interface. There are no events, so embedding it into a Winforms app
  with a progress bar would be difficult. Again it lacks an easy way
  to use or access many ZIP features, like encryption or ZIP64 or
  self-extracting archives. Also, the shell32.dll is designed for use
  within Windows Explorer, and presumes a user interface. In fact in
  some cases, calling into this DLL to perform a ZIP extraction can
  display a dialog box, so it may not be suitable for use within
  server or "headless" applications.

There are other libraries out there than do zip files for .NET. But
there are compromises with each one. Some are commercial and expensive.
Some are slow. Some are complicated to use. Some of these options lack
features. Some of them have more than one of these drawbacks.

DotNetZip provides another option. It's a very simple-to-use class
library that provides good ZIP file support. Using this library, you
can write .NET applications that read and write zip-format files,
including files with passwords, Unicode filenames, ZIP64, AES
encryption, and comments. The library also supports self-extracting
archives. It is well documented and provides good performance.

Though DotNetZip is implemented in .NET and was originally intended to
provide a managed-code library for ZIP files, you can now use it library
from any COM environment, including Javascript, VBScript, VB6, VBA, PHP,
Perl, and others. Using DotNetZip, you could generate an AES-encrypted
zip file from within the code of a macro running in MS-Excel, for example.

DotNetZip works with applications running on PCs with Windows. There is a
version of this library available for the .NET Compact Framework, too.

I have not tested DotNetZip for use with Mono, but I've heard reports
that people use the binary releases with Mono successfully, without
change.

DotNetZip is derived in part from ZLIB, the C-language library by Mark
Adler and Jean-loup Gailly . See the License.ZLIB.txt file included in
the DotNetZip download for details.

## What is DotNetZip? and How is it packaged?

DotNetZip is primarily a managed library for dealing with ZIP files.

It is packaged as a DLL that your application must reference:
Ionic.Zip.dll. In the "developer's kit" package, there is
documentation, code examples, and debug versions of the DLL.

The ZIP library depends on a set of supporting classes for doing
compression and decompression; these are exposed in other namespaces.

The classes in the ZIP library reside in these namespaces:

## namespace interesting classes

Ionic.Zip ZipFile, ZipEntry, ZipOutputStream, and
ZipInputStream.

Ionic.Zlib DeflateStream, GZipStream, ZlibStream

Ionic.BZip2 BZip2InputStream, BZip2OutputStream

Ionic.Crc CRC32

If you want only ZLIB (raw compression and decompression, RFC 1950,
1951, and 1952), the ZLIB classes are packaged independently, in
Ionic.Zlib.dll. Likewise, if you want to do BZIP2 compression, outside
the scope of a zip file, you can use the Ionic.BZip2.dll assembly.

If you want ZIP, or both ZIP and ZLIB, then your application should
depend soly on Ionic.Zip.dll; this assembly includes a superset of the
classes in Ionic.Zlib.dll and Ionic.BZip2.dll.

For each DLL, there is a version for the regular .NET Framework and
another for the Compact Framework.

DotNetZip also includes command-line and GUI tools for manipulating zip
files; these can be helpful to developers when building applications
that create or manipulate zip files. They also can be helpful as
end-user tools.

There are other downloads for DotNetZip - the source package, the
runtime-only package (DLLs and no helpfile or tools), the
documentation-only package, etc.

## Using the Zip Class Library: The Basics

The examples here provide just the basics.

There are many other examples available: some are included in the source
package, some in the class reference documentation in the help file, and
others on the web. Those examples provide many illustrate how to read
and write zip files, taking advantage of all the various features of zip
files exposed by the library. For a full set of examples, your best bet
is to see the documentation. Here's a basic primer:

The main type you will use to fiddle with zip files is the ZipFile
class. Full name: Ionic.Zip.ZipFile. You use this to create, read, or
update zip files. There is also a ZipOutputStream class, which offers a
Stream metaphor, for those who want it. You should choose one or the
other for your application.

The simplest way to create a ZIP file in C# looks like this:

```
  using(ZipFile zip= new ZipFile())
  {
    zip.AddFile(filename);
    zip.Save(NameOfZipFileTocreate);
  }

```

Or in VB.NET, like this:

```
 Using zip As ZipFile = New ZipFile
     zip.AddFile(filename)
     zip.Save("MyZipFile.zip")
 End Using

```

The using clause is important; don't leave it out.

The simplest way to Extract all the entries from a zipfile looks
like this:

```
  using (ZipFile zip = ZipFile.Read(NameOfExistingZipFile))
  {
    zip.ExtractAll(args[1]);
  }

```

But you could also do something like this:

```
  using (ZipFile zip = ZipFile.Read(NameOfExistingZipFile))
  {
    foreach (ZipEntry e in zip)
    {
      e.Extract();
    }
  }

```

Or in VB, extraction would be like this:
Using zip As ZipFile = ZipFile.Read(NameOfExistingZipFile)
zip.ExtractAll
End Using

Or this:
Using zip As ZipFile = ZipFile.Read(NameOfExistingZipFile)
Dim e As ZipEntry
For Each e In zip
e.Extract
Next
End Using

That covers the basics.

Notice that a using clause is always employed. DOn't forget this. Don't
leave it off. If you don't understand what it is, don't just skip it.
It's important.

There are a number of other options for using the class library. For
example, you can read zip archives from streams, or you can create
(write) zip archives to streams, or you can extract into streams. You
can apply passwords for weak encryption. You can specify a code page
for the filenames and metadata of entries in an archive. You can rename
entries in archives, and you can add or remove entries from archives.
You can set up save and read progress events. You can do LINQ queries on
the Entries collection. Check the documentation for complete
information, or use Visual Studio's intellisense to explore some of the
properties and methods on the ZipFile class.

Another type you will use is ZipEntry. This represents a single entry -
either a file or a directory - within a ZipFile. To add an entry to a
zip file, you call one of the AddEntry (or AddFile) methods on the
ZipFile class. You never directly instantiate a ZipEntry type. The
AddEntry/AddFile returns a ZipEntry type; you can then modify the
properties of the entry within the zip file, using that object.

For example, the following code adds a file as an entry into a ZipFile,
then renames the entry within the zip file:

```
  using(ZipFile zip= new ZipFile())
  {
    ZipEntry e = zip.AddFile(filename);
    e.FileName = "RenamedFile.txt";
    zip.Save(NameOfZipFileTocreate);
  }

```

Extracting a zip file that was created in this way will produce a file
called "RenamedFile.txt", regardless of the name of the file originally
added to the ZipFile.

As an alternative to using ZipFile type to create a zip file, you can
use the ZipOutputStream type to create zip files . To do so, wrap it
around a stream, and write to it.

```
  using (var fs = File.Create(filename))
  {
    using(var s = new ZipOutputStream(fs))
    {
      s.PutNextEntry("entry1.txt");
      byte[] buffer = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes("This is the content for entry #1.");
      s.Write(buffer, 0, buffer.Length);
    }
  }

```

Unlike the ZipFile class, the ZipOutputStream class can only create zip
files. It cannot read or update zip files.

If you want to read zip files using a streaming metaphor, you can use
ZipInputStream. Think of ZipInputStream and ZipOutputStream as
alternatives to using ZipFile to manipulate zip files. The former is for
reading zip files; the latter is for writing them.

## About Directory Paths

One important note: the ZipFile.AddXxx methods add the file or
directory you specify, including the directory. In other words,
logic like this:
ZipFile zip = new ZipFile();
zip.AddFile("c:\a\b\c\Hello.doc");
zip.Save();

...will produce a zip archive that contains a single entry, or file, and
that file is stored with the relative directory information. When you
extract that file from the zip, either using this Zip library or winzip
or the built-in zip support in Windows, or some other package, all those
directories will be created, and the file will be written into that
directory hierarchy. At extraction time, if you were to extract that
file into a directory like c:\documents, then resulting file would be
named c:\documents\a\b\c\Hello.doc .

This is by design.

If you don't want that directory information in your archive,
then you need to use the overload of the AddFile() method that
allows you to explicitly specify the directory used for the entry
within the archive:

```
zip.AddFile("c:\\a\\b\\c\\Hello.doc", "files");
zip.Save();

```

This will create an archive with an entry called "files\Hello.doc",
which contains the contents of the on-disk file located at
c:\a\b\c\Hello.doc .

If you extract that file into a directory e:\documents, then the
resulting file will be called e:\documents\files\Hello.doc .

If you want no directory at all, specify "" (the empty string).
Specifying null (Nothing in VB) will include all the directory hierarchy
in the filename, as in the orginal case.

## Pre-requisites to run Applications that use DotNetZip

To run desktop applications that depend on DotNetZip:
.NET Framework 4.0 or later

## In more detail: The Zip Class Library

The Zip class library is packaged as Ionic.Zip.DLL for the regular .NET
Framework and Ionic.Zip.CF.dll for the Compact Framework. The Zip
library allows applications to create, read, and update zip files.

This library uses the DeflateStream class to compress file data,
and extends it to support reading and writing of the metadata -
the header, CRC, and other optional data - defined or required
by the zip format spec.

The key object in the class library is the ZipFile class. Some of the
important methods on it:

```
  - AddItem - adds a file or a directory to a zip archive
  - AddDirectory - adds a directory to a zip archive
  - AddFile - adds a file to a zip archive
  - AddFiles - adds a set of files to a zip archive
  - Extract - extract a single element from a zip file
  - Read - static methods to read in an existing zipfile, for
           later extraction
  - Save - save a zipfile to disk

```

There is also a supporting class, called ZipEntry. Applications can
enumerate the entries in a ZipFile, via ZipEntry. There are other
supporting classes as well. Typically, 80% of apps will use just the
ZipFile class, and will not need to directly interact with these other
classes. But they are there if you need them.

If you want to create or read zip files, the Ionic.Zip.DLL assembly is
the one you want.

When building applications that do zip stuff, you need to add a reference to
the Ionic.Zip.dll in Visual Studio, or specify Ionic.Zip.dll with the
/R flag on the CSC.exe or VB.exe compiler line.

## In more detail: The Zlib Class Library

The Zlib class library is packaged as Ionic.Zlib.DLL for the regular .NET
Framework and Ionic.Zlib.CF.dll for the Compact Framework. The ZLIB
library does compression and decompression according to IETF RFC's 1950 (ZLIB),
1951 (Deflate), and 1952 (GZIP).

See <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1950.txt>
<http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1951.txt>
and <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1952.txt>

The key classes are:

ZlibCodec - a class for Zlib (RFC1950/1951/1952) encoding and decoding.
This low-level class does deflation and inflation on buffers.

DeflateStream - patterned after the DeflateStream in
System.IO.Compression, this class supports compression
levels and other options.

GZipStream - patterned after the GZipStream in
System.IO.Compression, this class supports compression
levels and other options.

ZlibStream - similar to the GZipStream in
System.IO.Compression, this class generates or consumes raw ZLIB
streams.

If you want to simply compress (deflate) raw block or stream data, this
library is the thing you want.

When building applications that do zlib things, you need to add a reference to
the Ionic.Zlib.dll in Visual Studio, or specify Ionic.Zlib.dll with the
/R flag on the CSC.exe or VB.exe compiler line.

NB: If your application does both Zlib and Zip stuff, you need only add
a reference to Ionic.Zip.dll. Ionic.Zip.dll includes all the capability
in Ionic.Zlib.dll. Ionic.Zip.dll is a superset.

## In more detail: The BZip2 Class Library

The BZip2 class library is packaged as Ionic.BZip2.DLL for the regular .NET
Framework and Ionic.BZip2.CF.dll for the Compact Framework. The BZip2
library does compression according to the bzip2 format created by
Julian Seward.
See <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bzip2>

NB: If your application does a combination of BZip2, Zlib and Zip stuff,
you need only add a reference to Ionic.Zip.dll. Ionic.Zip.dll includes
all the capability in Ionic.Zlib.dll and Ionic.BZip2.dll. Ionic.Zip.dll
is a superset.

If you try to link to more than one of these, you will get compiler
warnings about "duplicate types".

## Namespace changes for DotNetZip

The namespace for the DotNetZip classes is Ionic.Zip.
Classes are like:
Ionic.Zip.ZipFile
Ionic.Zip.ZipEntry
Ionic.Zip.ZipException
etc

(check the .chm file for the full list)

For the versions prior to v1.7, the namespace DotNetZip was Ionic.Utils.Zip.
The classes were like so:
Ionic.Utils.Zip.ZipFile
Ionic.Utils.Zip.ZipEntry
etc

If you have code that depends on an older version of the library, with
classes in the Ionic.Utils.Zip namespace), a simple namespace
replacement will allow your code to compile against the new version of
the library.

In addition to the Zip capability, DotNetZip includes capability (new
for v1.7). For Zlib, the classes are like this:
Ionic.Zlib.DeflateStream
Ionic.Zlib.ZlibStream
Ionic.Zlib.ZlibCodec
...

(again, check the .chm file for the full list)

For v1.9.1.6, the CRC class moved from the Ionic.Zlib namespace to the
Ionic.Crc namespace.

## Dependencies

Originally, this library was designed to depend upon the built-in
System.IO.Compression.DeflateStream class for the compression. This
proved to be less than satisfactory because the built-in compression
library did not support compression levels and also was not available on
.NET CF 2.0.

As of v1.7, the library includes a managed code version of zlib, the
library that produces RFC1950 and RFC1951 compressed streams. Within
that version of zlib, there is also a DeflateStream class which is
similar to the built-in System.IO.Compression.DeflateStream, but more
flexible, and often more effective as well.

## The Documentation

There is a single set of developer reference documentation for all of
the DotNetZip library features, including Zip and Zlib stuff. It is
packaged in two ways: As a .chm file, and as a Help Viewer 1.0 resource.
The latter is the new format suitable for viewing within VS2010.

If you only use the Zlib stuff, then you should focus on the doc in the
Ionic.Zlib namespace. Likewise BZip2. If you are building apps for
mobile devices running the Compact Framework, then ignore the pieces
that deal with SaveSelfExtractor() and AES.

Consult the help file for more specifics here.

In some cases, upon opening the .chm file for DotNetZip, the help
items tree loads, but the contents are empty. You may see an error:
"This program cannot display the webpage." or, "Address is invalid."
If this happens, it's likely that you've encountered a problem with Windows
protection of files downloaded from less trusted locations. To work around
this, within Windows Explorer, right-click on the CHM file, select properties,
and Unblock it, using the button in lower part of properties window.

The help is also packaged in a format that you can integrate into Visual
Studio 2008, or Visual Studio 2010. VS2008 requires MS Help 2.0, while
VS2010 requires a different, newer format, sometimes called MS Help 3,
and sometimes (confusingly) called "MS Help Viewer 1.0 format".

The DotNetZip "devkit" download includes help in all these formats.

## The Zip Format

The zip format is described by PKWare, at
<http://www.pkware.com/business_and_developers/developer/popups/appnote.txt>

Every valid zipfile conforms to this specification. For example, the
spec says that for each compressed file contained in the zip archive,
the zipfile contains a byte array of compressed data. (The byte array
is something the DeflateStream class can produce directly.) But the
zipfile also contains header and "directory" information - you might
call this "metadata". In other words, the zipfile must contain a list
of all the compressed files in the archive. The zipfile also contains
CRC checksums, and can also contain comments, and other optional
attributes for each file. These are things the DeflateStream class -
either the one included in the .NET Framework Class Library, or the one
embedded in this library - does not read or write.

Managing the metadata in a zip file is most of what DotNetZip does.

## Which DLL to use?

The binary releases of DotNetZip include multiple distinct DLLs or
assemblies. Which one should you use?

The likely answer is: use Ionic.Zip.dll.

That's the mainstream library, the full library, and it includes all the
capability. If you have particular requirements, like you want a
smaller library, or you want to exclude the Self-Extracting stuff, or
you only want the ZLIB capability, then you may want to choose a
different assembly.

Here's a summary of the options.

## Usage scenario Reference this DLL

reading or writing Zip files Ionic.Zip.dll

raw block or stream compression, ZLIB, GZIP, Ionic.Zlib.dll
or DEFLATE

raw block or stream compression, BZIP2 Ionic.BZip2.dll

both raw compression as well as reading Ionic.Zip.dll
or writing Zip files

reading or writing Zip files, using desktop Ionic.Zip.Reduced.dll
.NET framework but never creating a
self-extracting archive

Never reference both Ionic.Zlib.dll and Ionic.Zip.dll, or both
Ionic.BZip2.dll and Ionic.Zip.dll in the same application. If your
application does both Zlib and Zip stuff, you need only add a reference
to Ionic.Zip.dll. Ionic.Zip.dll includes all the capability in
Ionic.Zlib.dll and Ionic.BZip2.dll You always need to reference only a
single Ionic DLL, regardless whether you use Zlib or BZip2 or Zip or
some combination.

## Self-Extracting Archive support

The Self-Extracting Archive (SFX) support in the library allows you to
create a self-extracting zip archive. An SFX is both a standard EXE
file *and* a ZIP file. The exe contains boilerplate program logic to
unzip the embedded zip file. When the user executes the SFX runs, the
boilerplate application logic just reads the zip content and
then unzips itself. You can open an SFX in WinZip and other zip tools,
as well, if you want to view it.

Running the SFX (unpacking from the SFX) requires the .NET Framework
installed on the machine, but does not require the DotNetZip library.

There are two versions of the SFX - one that presents a GUI form, and
another that runs as a console (command line) application.

NB: Creation of SFX is not supported in the Compact Framework version of
the library.

Also, there is no way, currently, to produce an SFX file that can run on
the .NET Compact Framework.

## The Reduced ZIP library

The full DotNetZip library is currently about 400k in size. The SFX
(Self-Extracting Archive) support is responsible for more than half the
total size of the library. Some deployments may wish to omit the SFX
support in order to get a smaller DLL. For that you can rely on the
Ionic.Zip.Reduced.dll. It provides everything the normal library does,
except the SaveSelfExtractor() method on the ZipFile class.

For size comparisons...these approximate figures are for v1.9.1.6 of the
library:

#### Desktop Framework:

```
  assembly              ~size   comment
  -------------------------------------------------------
  Ionic.Zlib.dll         100k   {Deflate,GZip,Zlib}Stream and ZlibCodec

  Ionic.BZip2.dll         57k   BZip2{Input,Output}Stream

  Ionic.Zip.dll          460k   includes ZLIB and BZIP2 compression,
                                SFX, selector logic, WinZIP AES encryption,
                                and the ComHelper class

  Ionic.Zip.Reduced.dll  250k   includes everything in the main ZIP
                                library except SFX. (ability to save
                                Self-extracting archives)

```

## Support

There is no official support for this library. I try to make a good
effort to answer questions and monitor the work items raised on the
project portal at:

```
http://DotNetZip.codeplex.com.

```

## About Intellectual Property

I am no lawyer, but before using this library in your app, it
may be worth reviewing the various licenses.

The specification for the zip format, which PKWARE owns, includes a
paragraph that reads:

PKWARE is committed to the interoperability and advancement of the
.ZIP format. PKWARE offers a free license for certain technological
aspects described above under certain restrictions and conditions.
However, the use or implementation in a product of certain technological
aspects set forth in the current APPNOTE, including those with regard to
strong encryption or patching, requires a license from PKWARE. Please
contact PKWARE with regard to acquiring a license.

Contact pkware at: zipformat@pkware.com

This library does not do strong encryption as described by PKWare, nor
does it do patching. But again... I am no lawyer.

This library uses a ZLIB implementation that is based on a conversion of
the jzlib project <http://www.jcraft.com/jzlib/>. The license and
disclaimer required by the jzlib source license is referenced in the
relevant source files of DotNetZip, specifically in the sources for the
Zlib module.

This library uses a BZip2 implementation that is based on a conversion
of the bzip2 implementation in the Apache Commons compression library.
The Apache license is referenced in the relevant source files of
DotNetZip, specifically in the sources for the BZip2 module.

## Limitations

There are a few limitations to this library:

It does not do strong encryption.

The GUI tool for creating zips is functional but basic. This isn't a limitation
of the library per se.

...and, I'm sure, many others

But it is a good basic library for reading and writing zipfiles
in .NET applications.

# Building the Library

This section is mostly interesting to developers who will work on or
view the source code of DotNetZip, to extend or re-purpose it. If you
only plan to use DotNetZip in applications of your own, you probably
don't need to concern yourself with the information that follows.

## Pre-requisites to build DotNetZip

.NET Framework 4.0 SDK or later
-or-
Visual Studio 2010 or later

-and-

ILMerge - a tool from Microsoft that combines
multiple managed assemblies into a single DLL or image. It is in
similar in some respects to the lib tool in C toolkits.

You can get it here:
<http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=22914587-b4ad-4eae-87cf-b14ae6a939b0&displaylang=en>

## Building DotNetZip with the .NET SDK

To build the library using the .NET Framework SDK v4.0,

1. extract the contents of the source zip into a new directory.
2. be sure the .NET 4.0 SDK and runtime directories are on your
   path.
3. Modify the .csproj files in Zip and ZLIB and BZip2 to eliminate
   mention of the Ionic.pfx and Ionic.snk files.

   The various DLLs (Zip Partial, ZLIB, etc.) are signed with my private
   key. You will want to remove the mention of the private key in the
   project files. I cannot distribute my private key, so don't ask me!
   That would be silly. So you have to modify the project in order to
   build without the key.
4. open a CMD prompt and CD to the DotNetZip directory.
5. msbuild

   Be sure you are using the .NET 3.5 version of MSBuild.
   This builds the "Debug" version of the library. To build the
   "Release" version, do this:

   msbuild /t:Release
6. to clean and rebuild, do
   msbuild /t:clean
   msbuild
7. There are two setup directories, which contain the projects necessary
   to build the MSI file. Unfortunately msbuild does not include
   support for building setup projects (vdproj). You need Visual Studio
   to build the setup directories.

   I am in the process of converting these from .vdproj to .wixproj, so
   they can be built from the command line using msbuild. .

## Building DotNetZip with Visual Studio

To build DotNetZip using Visual Studio 2010,

1. Open the DotNetZip.sln file in VS2010.
2. If necessary, Remove the dependencies on Ionic.pfx and Ionic.snk.

   (References to these will have already been removed from the zipped
   source distributions, but if you get your source from the TFS server,
   then you will have to remove references to the keyfiles manually)

   The various DLLs (Zip, ZLIB, etc.) are signed with my (Dino
   Chiesa's) private key. I do not distribute that key for anyone
   else's use. If you build the DotNetZip library from source, You will
   want to remove the mention of the private key in the project files. I
   will not distribute my private key, that would be silly. So don't
   ask me!
3. Press F6 to build everything.

## The Project Structure and Build approach

The function here is grouped into three basic sets: Zip,
ZLIB/Deflate/GZIP, and BZip2. The Zip group is a superset of the ZLIB
and BZIP2 groups.

Each group of functionality is packaged into various assemblies, one
assembly per "platform". The platforms supported are: .NET (Desktop).

There is also a special "Zip Reduced" library, available only on the
Desktop platform; it is a reduced-function version of the regular
Desktop Framework zip library. It provides an option of using a smaller
library for those zip-handling applications that don't produce
Self-extracting archives.

In a previous guise, DotNetZip relied on the ILMerge tool to combine
distinct DLLs into a single package. This is no longer the case.

Because the ZIP projects include the ZLIB and BZIP2 function, the
appropriate source modules for the ZLIB and Bzip2 are "linked" into each
of the ZIP projects (Desktop).

## Regarding the missing Ionic.pfx and Ionic.snk files

The binary DLLs shipped in the codeplex project are signed by me, Dino
Chiesa. This provides a "strong name" for the assembly, which itself
provides some assurance as to the integrity of the library, and also
allows it to be run within restricted sites, like apps running inside
web hosters.

For more on strong names, see this article:
<http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/magazine/cc163583.aspx>

Signing is done automatically at build time in the Visual Studio project or in
the msbuild build. There
is a .pfx file that holds the crypto stuff for signing the assembly, and
that pfx file is itself protected by a password. There is also an
Ionic.snk file which is referenced by the project, but which I do not
distribute.

People opening the project ask me: what's the password to this .pfx
file? Where's the .snk file?

Here's the problem; those files contain my private key. if I give
everyone the password to the PFX file or the .snk file, then anyone can
go and build a modified Ionic.Zip.dll, and sign it with my key, and
apply any version number they like. This means there could be multiple
distinct assemblies with the same signature. This is obviously not
good.

Since I don't release the ability to sign DLLs with my key, the DLL
signed with my key is guaranteed to be produced by me only, which is in
fact the exact intent of code signing in .NET.

If anyone wants to modify the project and re-compile it, they have a
couple options:

* sign the assembly themselves, using their own key.
* produce a modified, unsigned assembly

In either case it is not the same as the assembly I am shipping,
therefore it should not be signed with the same key.

All clear?

As for those options above, here is some more detail:

1. If you want a strong-named assembly, then create your own PFX file
   and .snk file and modify the appropriate projects to use those new
   files.
2. If you don't need a strong-named assembly, then remove all the
   signing from the various projects.

In either case, you will need to modify the "Zip", BZip, and the "Zlib"
projects.

## Building the Documentation

The documentation files are built using the Sandcastle Helpfile Builder
tool, also available on CodePlex at <http://www.codeplex.com/SHFB> . It
is built from in-code xml documentation, augmented with some additional
out-of-band html documentation.

If you want to build the help files yourself, you will need to have
Sandcastle from May 2008 (or later, I guess), and SHFB, from February
2009. Both are free tools available from <http://codeplex.com> . I think
you can get a package download of both of these by installing v1.9.3.0
of SHFB .

The helpfile projects are:

HtmlHelp1.shfbproj - to build the .chm file
MSHelp2.shfbproj - to build the MS Help 2.0 content
HelpViewer.shfbproj - to build the MS Help Viewer 1.0 content

(The MSHelp2 project is broken at the moment.)

To build the documentation in any of these formats, first build the "zip
Full DLL" project in the source (Ionic.Zip.dll), then run:

msbuild HtmlHelp1.shfbproj

```
-or-

```

msbuild HelpViewer.shfbproj

The Help Viewer 1.0 content can be viewed in the help viewer that is
integrated into VS 2010, or in an alternative viewer, such as
H3Viewer.exe. See <http://mshcmigrate.helpmvp.com/viewer> .

## Examples

The source solution also includes a number of example applications
showing how to use the DotNetZip library and all its features - creating
ZIPs, using Unicode, passwords, comments, streams, and so on. Most of
these will be built when you build the solution. Some of them do not -
you will need to build them independently.

## Tests

There are two source projects in the VS Solution that contain Unit
Tests: one for the zlib library, one for the bzip2 library, and another
for the Zip library. If you develop any new tests for DotNetZip, I'd be
glad to look at them.

# Origins

This library is mostly original code.

There is a GPL-licensed library called SharpZipLib that writes zip
files, it can be found at
<http://www.sharpdevelop.net/OpenSource/SharpZipLib/Default.aspx>

This library is not based on SharpZipLib.

I think there may be a Zip library shipped as part of the Mono
project. This library is also not based on that.

Now that the Java class library is open source, there is at least one
open-source Java implementation for zip. This implementation is not
based on a port of Sun's JDK code.

There is a zlib.net project from ComponentAce.com. This library is not
based on that code.

This library is all new code, written by me, with these exceptions:

* the CRC32 class - see above for credit.
* the zlib library - see above for credit.
* the bzip2 compressor - see above for credit.

## About

Please use System.IO.Compression! A fork of the DotNetZip project without signing with a solution that compiles cleanly. This project aims to follow semver to avoid versioning conflicts. DotNetZip is a FAST, FREE class library and toolset for manipulating zip files. Use VB, C# or any .NET language to easily create, extract, or update zip files.

# Zip Slip Vulnerability

Zip Slip is a widespread arbitrary file overwrite critical vulnerability, which typically results in remote command execution. It was discovered and responsibly disclosed by the Snyk Security team ahead of a public disclosure on 5th June 2018, and affects thousands of projects, including ones from HP, Amazon, Apache, Pivotal and  [many more (CVEs and full list here).](https://github.com/snyk/zip-slip-vulnerability)  Of course, this type of vulnerability has existed before, but recently it has manifested itself in a much larger number of projects and libraries.

![Zip Slip](https://res.cloudinary.com/snyk/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,c_thumb,h_225,w_225/v1527156415/research/zipslip.png)

The vulnerability has been found in multiple ecosystems, including JavaScript, Ruby, .NET and Go, but is especially prevalent in Java, where there is no central library offering high level processing of archive (e.g. zip) files. The lack of such a library led to vulnerable code snippets being hand crafted and shared among developer communities such as  [StackOverflow.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/981578/how-to-unzip-files-recursively-in-java)

The vulnerability is exploited using a specially crafted archive that holds directory traversal filenames (e.g. ../../evil.sh). The Zip Slip vulnerability can affect numerous archive formats, including tar, jar, war, cpio, apk, rar and 7z. If you’d like the information on this page in a downloadable technical white paper, click the button below.

 [Download Technical White Paper](https://res.cloudinary.com/snyk/image/upload/v1528192501/zip-slip-vulnerability/technical-whitepaper.pdf)

Zip Slip is a form of directory traversal that can be exploited by extracting files from an archive. The premise of the directory traversal vulnerability is that an attacker can gain access to parts of the file system outside of the target folder in which they should reside. The attacker can then overwrite executable files and either invoke them remotely or wait for the system or user to call them, thus achieving remote command execution on the victim’s machine. The vulnerability can also cause damage by overwriting configuration files or other sensitive resources, and can be exploited on both client (user) machines and servers.

##### Exploitable Application Flow

The two parts required to exploit this vulnerability is a malicious archive and extraction code that does not perform validation checking. Let’s look through each of these in turn. First of all, the contents of the zip file needs to have one or more files that break out of the target directory when extracted. In the example below, we can see the contents of a zip file. It has two files, a good.sh file which would be extracted into the target directory and an evil.sh file which is trying to traverse up the directory tree to hit the root and then add a file into the tmp directory. When you attempt to cd .. in the root directory, you still find yourself in the root directory, so a malicious path could contain many levels of ../ to stand a better chance of reaching the root directory, before trying to traverse to sensitive files.

```
  5 Tue Jun 5 11:04:29 BST 2018 good.sh 20 Tue Jun 5 11:04:42 BST 2018 ../../../../../../../../tmp/evil.sh
```

The contents of this zip file have to be hand crafted. Archive creation tools don’t typically allow users to add files with these paths, despite the zip specification allowing it. However, with the right tools, it’s easy to create files with these paths.

 The second thing you’ll need to exploit this vulnerability is to extract the archive, either using your own code or a library. The vulnerability exists when the extraction code omits validation on the file paths in the archive. An example of a vulnerable code snippet (example shown in Java) can be seen below.

```
  1   Enumeration<ZipEntry>entries = zip.getEntries();
  2   while (entries.hasMoreElements()) {
  3       ZipEntry e = entries.nextElement();
  4       File f = new File(destinationDir, e.getName());
  5       InputStream input = zip.getInputStream(e);
  6       IOUtils.copy(input, write(f));
  7   }
```

You can see on line 4, e.getName() is concatenated with the target directory, dir, without being validated. At this point, when our zip archive gets to our evil.sh, it will append the full path (including every ../) of the zip entry to the target directory resulting in evil.sh being written outside of the target directory.

 To see Zip Slip in action,  [watch us exploit the vulnerable java-goof application](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1MT5lr4p9o)  , a sample application used to show many known vulnerabilities.

##### Are you Vulnerable?

You are vulnerable if you are either using a library which contains the Zip Slip vulnerability or your project directly contains vulnerable code, which extracts files from an archive without the necessary directory traversal validation. Snyk is maintaining a [GitHub repository listing all](https://github.com/snyk/zip-slip-vulnerability) projects that have been found vulnerable to Zip Slip and have been responsibly disclosed to, including fix dates and versions. The repository is open to contributions from the wider community to ensure it holds the most up to date status.s.

##### What action should you take?

Here are some steps you can take to check if your project’s dependencies of code contain the Zip Slip vulnerability:

##### 1. Search through your projects for vulnerable code.

JavaGroovyJavaScript.NETGoRuby & Python
##### 2. Add Zip Slip Security Testing to your application build pipeline

If you’d prefer not to search through your direct and transitive dependencies (of which you likely have hundreds) to determine if you’re using a vulnerable library, you can choose a dependency vulnerability scanning tool, like Snyk. It’s a good practice to add security testing into your development lifecycle stages, such as during development, CI, deployment and production. You can test your own projects (all the ecosystems mentioned above are supported) to determine if they are vulnerable to Zip Slip.

##### Other vulnerable projects

Vulnerable projects include projects in various ecosystems that either use the libraries mentioned above or directly include vulnerable code. Of the many thousands of projects that have contained similar vulnerable code samples or accessed vulnerable libraries, the most significant include: Oracle, Amazon, Spring/Pivotal, Linkedin, Twitter, Alibaba, Jenkinsci, Eclipse, OWASP, SonarQube, OpenTable, Arduino, ElasticSearch, Selenium, JetBrains and Google.

##### Thank you!

The Snyk security team would like for thank all the vendors, project owners and the community members that helped raise awareness, find and fix vulnerabilities in projects across many ecosystems.

### @shana **[shana](/shana)** commented [May 2, 2018](#issue-319465038)

Zip entries can contain relative paths that end up outside the extraction directory if used as-is, for instance `..\..\..\..\file.txt`, which can be a potential security risk. This sanitizes all paths before extraction while ensuring that valid relative paths are not lost.

* `a\..\c\file.txt` -> `c\file.txt`
* `a\..\..\c\file.txt` -> `c\file.txt`
* `..\..\..\..\c\file.txt` -> `c\file.txt`
* `a\b\..\c\file.txt` -> `a\c\file.txt`
* `a\b\c\..\e\..\..\f\file.txt` -> `a\f\file.txt`

Many thanks to Snyk Security Research Team for tracking down this issue.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Zip Slip is a widespread critical archive extraction vulnerability, allowing attackers to write arbitrary files on the system, typically resulting in remote command execution. It was discovered and responsibly disclosed by the Snyk Security team ahead of a public disclosure on 5th June 2018, and affects thousands of projects, including ones from HP, Amazon, Apache, Pivotal and many more. This page provides the most up-to-date fix statuses for the libraries and projects that were found to be exploitable or contain a vulnerable implementation.

For more information on the technical details of Zip Slip, read <http://snyk.io/research/zip-slip-vulnerability>.

The vulnerability has been found in multiple ecosystems, including JavaScript, Ruby, .NET and Go, but is especially prevalent in Java, where there is no central library offering high level processing of archive (e.g. `zip`) files. The lack of such a library led to vulnerable code snippets being hand-crafted and shared among developer communities such as [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/981578/how-to-unzip-files-recursively-in-java).

The vulnerability is exploited using a specially crafted archive that holds directory traversal filenames (e.g. `../../evil.sh`). The Zip Slip vulnerability can affect numerous archive formats, including `tar`, `jar`, `war`, `cpio`, `apk`, `rar` and `7z`.

Here is a vulnerable code example showing a `ZipEntry` path being concatenated to a destination directory without any path validation. Code similar to this has been found in many repositories across many ecosystems, including libraries which thousands of applications depend on.

```
   Enumeration<ZipEntry> entries = zip.getEntries();
   while (entries.hasMoreElements()) {
      ZipEntry e = entries.nextElement();
      File f = new File(destinationDir, e.getName());
      InputStream input = zip.getInputStream(e);
      IOUtils.copy(input, write(f));
   }
```

If you find a library or project that contains similar vulnerable code, we ask for your contribution to this repository to provide the community with the most up to date information about the Zip Slip vulnerability. To contribute, please refer to our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/snyk/zip-slip-vulnerability/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

## Affected Libraries

Many of the following affected libraries exist because their ecosystems lack high level APIs providing the basic archive management capabilities. This results in vulnerable code being shared and reused. The following table contains the list of vulnerable libraries we found during private disclosure of Zip Slip which we aim to keep up to date, with community support, going forward as more vulnerable libraries are discovered. Some libraries that do not provide the high-level API often result in vulnerable implementations also, either through people copying and pasting vulnerable private code, or writing their own vulnerable snippets.

## Defensively fixed but deemed not exploitable

Some projects were confirmed by the project maintainers that their implementation code was not vulnerable to Zip Slip. However they decided to remove or fix their implementation so that in the future, the snippets could not be copied and become vulnerable elsewhere.

## Deemed not exploitable by the maintainer (vulnerable implementation remains)

The final list of projects are those with snippets of code that still have a vulnerable implementation, but are not exploitable. It is believed that it would not be possible to attack these projects in such a way that could lead to a malicious outcome, but the vulnerable pattern of code still exists within the code base. We strongly encourage such projects to fix the implementation both to prevent its use through other functionality, or use in other projects that copy paste snippets.
