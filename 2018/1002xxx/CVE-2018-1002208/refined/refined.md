```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the library not validating file paths during archive extraction, allowing for directory traversal.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Path traversal vulnerability (Zip Slip), leading to arbitrary file write.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the system, potentially leading to remote command execution if an executable or configuration file is overwritten with malicious content.",
  "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted zip archive containing directory traversal filenames (e.g., `../../evil.sh`).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious archive and have the vulnerable library extract it."
