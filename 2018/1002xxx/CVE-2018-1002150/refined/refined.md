Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1002150:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `host.distRepoMove` hub call in Koji does not perform proper access checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Access Control:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of adequate access control in the `host.distRepoMove` function. This allows unauthorized users to invoke the function, bypassing intended security restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Filesystem Manipulation:** An attacker could use this vulnerability to manipulate the filesystem.
- **Data Destruction:** This manipulation could lead to the destruction of data.
- **Exposure of Secrets:** Attackers might be able to expose secrets through this vulnerability by accessing or modifying sensitive files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access to Koji Hub:** An attacker would need to be able to communicate with the Koji hub.
- **Invocation of `host.distRepoMove`:** The attacker would need to invoke the vulnerable function directly or through a crafted request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Koji Hub:** The attacker must have a way to access the Koji hub. This could mean being on the same network or having valid credentials to interact with the hub (or exploiting another vulnerability to gain such access).
- **Understanding of Koji's API:** The attacker must have knowledge of how to call the `host.distRepoMove` function, including the required parameters.
