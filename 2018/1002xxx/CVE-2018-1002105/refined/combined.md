## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## [G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

### [2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos](#2-github-trademarks-and-logos)

If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: <https://github.com/logos>.

### [3. License to GitHub Policies](#3-license-to-github-policies)

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## [I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## [J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

## [K. Payment](#k-payment)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.*

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### [4. Authorization](#4-authorization)

Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

### [1. Account Cancellation](#1-account-cancellation)

You can [cancel your Account at any time](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

### [1. Electronic Communication Required](#1-electronic-communication-required)

For contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from us in an electronic form via the email address you have submitted or via the Service; and (2) agree that all Terms of Service, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that those communications would satisfy if they were on paper. This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation. Legal notice to GitHub must be in writing and [served on GitHub's legal agent](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/guidelines-for-legal-requests-of-user-data#submitting-requests).

### [3. No Phone Support](#3-no-phone-support)

## [N. Disclaimer of Warranties](#n-disclaimer-of-warranties)

**Short version:** *We provide our service as is, and we make no promises or guarantees about this service. Please read this section carefully; you should understand what to expect.*

GitHub provides the Website and the Service “as is” and “as available,” without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement.

GitHub does not warrant that the Service will meet your requirements; that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; that the information provided through the Service is accurate, reliable or correct; that any defects or errors will be corrected; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components.

## [O. Limitation of Liability](#o-limitation-of-liability)

**Short version:** *We will not be liable for damages or losses arising from your use or inability to use the service or otherwise arising under this agreement. Please read this section carefully; it limits our obligations to you.*

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

* the use, disclosure, or display of your User-Generated Content;
* your use or inability to use the Service;
* any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service;
* the Service generally or the software or systems that make the Service available;
* unauthorized access to or alterations of your transmissions or data;
* statements or conduct of any third party on the Service;
* any other user interactions that you input or receive through your use of the Service; or
* any other matter relating to the Service.

Our liability is limited whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy set forth in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose. We will have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond our reasonable control.

## [P. Release and Indemnification](#p-release-and-indemnification)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for your use of the service. If you harm someone else or get into a dispute with someone else, we will not be involved.*

If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you agree to release GitHub from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

## [Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, such as price increases, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website or sending email to the primary email address specified in your GitHub account. Customer's continued use of the Service after those 30 days constitutes agreement to those revisions of this Agreement. For any other modifications, your continued use of the Website constitutes agreement to our revisions of these Terms of Service. You can view all changes to these Terms in our [Site Policy](https://github.com/github/site-policy) repository.

     ![Duane LaFlotte](/_astro/duane.CAyBZp_-.png)
### Duane LaFlotte

CTO, Pulsar Security

  I feel like every person's first experience in cybersecurity should be OffSec. Before you go out to figure out how to create a zero-day and you get confused, if you start with OffSec, that won't happen due to how methodologically all the training is put together.      ![Emile Kok](/_astro/emile.C3f2EqfQ.png)

Founder and Managing Director, TSTC Institute

  When going to the real world, you have to know what you're doing and understand what is expected from you on the job. For us, OffSec is the champion in this league in educating and preparing learners.      ![Douglas Costa](/_astro/douglas.BdxOPM2d.png)

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A3624)

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release 3.5.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Critical. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is Red Hat's cloud computing Kubernetes application platform solution designed for on-premise or private cloud deployments.
Security Fix(es):

* A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in OpenShift Container Platform 3.x which allows for compromise of pods running on a compute node to which a pod is scheduled with normal user privilege. This access could include access to all secrets, pods, environment variables, running pod/container processes, and persistent volumes, including in privileged containers. Additionally, on versions 3.6 and higher of OpenShift Container Platform, this vulnerability allows cluster-admin level access to any API hosted by an aggregated API server. This includes the ‘servicecatalog’ API which is installed by default in 3.7 and later. Cluster-admin level access to the service catalog allows creation of brokered services by an unauthenticated user with escalated privileges in any namespace and on any node. This could lead to an attacker being allowed to deploy malicious code, or alter existing services. (CVE-2018-1002105)

Space precludes documenting all of the bug fixes and enhancements in this advisory. See the following Release Notes documentation for details about these changes:

## Overview

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform provides developers and IT organizations with a cloud
application platform for deploying new applications on secure, scalable
resources with minimal configuration and management overhead. OpenShift Container Platform
supports a wide selection of programming languages and frameworks, such as Java,
Ruby, and PHP.

Built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Kubernetes, OpenShift Container Platform provides a
secure and scalable multi-tenant operating system for today’s enterprise-class
applications, while providing integrated application runtimes and libraries.
OpenShift Container Platform enables organizations to meet security, privacy, compliance, and
governance requirements.

## About This Release

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 3.5
([RHBA-2017:0884](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2017%3A0884)) is now
available. This release is based on
[OpenShift
Origin 1.5](https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases/tag/v1.5.0-rc.0). New features, changes, bug fixes, and known issues that pertain to
OpenShift Container Platform 3.5 are included in this topic.

OpenShift Container Platform 3.5 is supported on RHEL 7.2 and 7.3 with the latest packages
from Extras, including Docker 1.12.

|  | OpenShift Container Platform 3.5 is not certified with older versions of Docker and RHEL 7.1 or earlier. |
| --- | --- |

TLSV1.2 is the only supported security version in OpenShift Container Platform version 3.4
and later. You must update if you are using TLSV1.0 or TLSV1.1.

For initial installations, see the
[Installing
a Cluster](../install_config/install/planning.html#install-config-install-planning) topics in the
[Installation and
Configuration](../install_config/index.html#install-config-index) documentation.

To upgrade to this release from a previous version, see the
[Upgrading
a Cluster](../install_config/upgrading/index.html#install-config-upgrading-index) topics in the
[Installation and
Configuration](../install_config/index.html#install-config-index) documentation.

## New Features and Enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.

### Container Orchestration

#### Shared Memory for Containers within the Same Pod

When running more than one container in the same pod, those containers can now
share memory segments because ***/dev/shm*** is shared across containers in a pod.
***/dev/shm*** is limited to 64 MB and charged under the `memcg cgroup`.

#### Ability to Refer to External Endpoints by Name

It is very common to add an external service to your application. This is a
service that does not live on the OpenShift Container Platform. Before this feature, you had
to add that endpoint to your application via IP address. These services often
had pools of IPs or required access via fully qualified domain name (FQDN),
which is similar to SNI in OpenShift Container Platform’s load balancer. Now, OpenShift Container Platform
has a new `ExternalName` type that will accept an FQDN.

#### Setting a NodeSelector and Whitelisting Labels

OpenShift Container Platform 3.5 now supports setting a `nodeSelector` on a namespace, with the
ability to whitelist labels during the selection. In
`cpodNodeSelectorPluginConfig`, there are four added levels of logic to allow
for various control of the selection process:

1. `clusterDefaultNodeSelector: region=west` - The default global (cluster level) list of labels (L1).
2. `ns1: os=centos,region=west` and `ns2: os=rhel` - The whitelist of labels per namespace (L2).
3. `scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/node-selector` - The default list of labels per namespace (L3).
4. `podSpec.nodeSelector` - The list of labels per pod (L4).

#### Kubelet Directory Should Not Share SELinux Labels with its Containers

Previously, the kubelet directory had to be labeled `svirt_sandbox_file_t`. This
widens the attack surface available to containers escaping namespace isolation.
Now, the kubelet directory has an SELinux context and the kubelet cannot share
SELinux labels that are known, preventing the intruder from doing more damage.
With OpenShift Container Platform 3.5, the use of `svirt_sandbox_file_t` is removed on the
kublet directory and ***openshift.local.volumes*** directory. The need to carry a
matching SElinux MAC is removed through the use of a `:Z` bind mount flag for
container directories.

#### Horizontal Pod Autoscaler Ignores Pod Startup Spikes

The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) now ignores the CPU usage for pods that are
not marked as `ready`, so that any extra CPU usage caused by initialization is
not the cause for a scale-up. Pods in the `unready` state will have zero CPU
usage when scaling up, and the HPA ignores them when scaling down. Pods without
known metrics will have a 0% CPU usage when scaling up, and 100% CPU when
scaling down. This allows for more stability during the HPA decision.

#### Control Over Multiple Secret File Permissions in a Volume

Many applications require that permissions on the mounted file (that hold their
configuration) be only owner readable. Users can now specify the mode for the
mount point in the downward API annotation or the `configMap`.

#### Kubelet Removes Memory-backed Volumes Upon Pod Termination

Previously, when a pod terminated, volumes used by `emptyDir`, `configMaps`, and
secrets on the node were kept. Now, the kubelet deletes memory-backed volumes
when the associated pods enter into terminated mode. This makes the vectors less
likely to be used as an attack vector.

#### Rate Limiting Controller Retries to Improve Cluster Stability

Controllers on the master can become unstable or cause resource issues when they
continuously retry on unresponsive endpoints in the cluster. OpenShift Container Platform 3.5
introduces logic to the controllers that controls how many times they retry
calls, and intelligently backs them off so that they do not hang.

These controllers now contain the logic:

* replication controller
* replica set
* daemonset
* certificates
* deployments
* endpoints
* pod disruption budget
* jobs

#### Kubelet Collection of Node Attributes for Scheduling Considerations (Technology Preview)

The kubelet is now able to collect any attribute on the node for scheduling
considerations. This feature is currently in [Technology
Preview](#ocp-35-technology-preview).

The cluster operator must advertise a per-node opaque resource on one or more
nodes. Users must request the opaque resource in pods. To advertise a new opaque
integer resource, the cluster operator should submit a PATCH HTTP request to the
API server to specify the available quantity in the `status.capacity` for a node
in the cluster. After this operation, the node’s `status.capacity` will include
a new resource. The `status.allocatable` field is updated automatically with the
new resource asynchronously by the kubelet.

See [Opaque
Integer Resources](../dev_guide/compute_resources.html#opaque-integer-resources) for more information.

#### StatefulSets (Technology Preview)

`StatefulSets` (currently in [Technology Preview](#ocp-35-technology-preview)
and formerly known as `PetSets`) offer more control over scale, network naming,
handling of PVs, and deployment sequencing.

This new controller allows for the deployment of application types that require
changes to their configuration or deployment count (instances) to be done in a
specific and ordered manner.

Supported:

* Declaration of the Ordinal Index.
* Stable network ID nomenclature.
* Controlled or manual handling of PVs.
* Sequence control at deployment time.
* Ordered control during scale up or scale down, based on instance status.

Not Supported:

* Slow to iterate through the Ordinal Index and, therefore, slow on scale up and
  scale down.
* No deployment or pod specification post deployment verification of what is
  deployed versus what is configured in the JSON file.
* Locality awareness of zones or regions when dealing with scale up or scale down
  ordinality changes or mounted PVs.

|  | If you have any existing `PetSets` in your cluster, you must remove them before upgrading to OpenShift Container Platform 3.5. Automatically migrating `PetSets` to `StatefulSets` in OpenShift Container Platform 3.5 is not supported. Follow the instructions for [manually migrating `PetSets` to `StatefulSets`](../install_config/upgrading/manual_upgrades.html#install-config-upgrading-manual-upgrades). |
| --- | --- |

See more information about [web console
enhancements](#ocp-35-web-console-statefulsets) related to this feature for OpenShift Container Platform 3.5.

### Registry

OpenShift Container Platform now allows control of whether or not an image is cached locally
in the internal OpenShift Container Registry via the `oc tag` command with the
`--reference-policy=local` and `--scheduled=true` options.

The storage of the manifest is moved to the OpenShift Container Registry,
instead of storing it in etcd. There are two processes that will clean up
existing images' metadata from etcd:

* `push` and `prune` will gradually migrate all etcd images to not have the manifest attached.
* Use a provided script manually to do them all at once.

Create an image stream from a Docker image and tell it to store locally in the
internal OpenShift Container Platform registry:

```
$ oc tag --reference-policy=local --source=docker docker.io/image:tag
myimagestream:tag
```

Schedule the image stream to track new image changes in the external registry:

```
$ oc tag --scheduled=true --source=docker docker.io/image:tag myimagestream:tag
```

See
[Extended
Registry Configuration](../install_config/registry/extended_registry_configuration.html#install-config-registry-extended-configuration) for more information.

### Platform Management

#### Application Service Certificate Regeneration (Technology Preview)

Application service certificate regeneration is currently in
[Technology Preview](#ocp-35-technology-preview).

The controller will now look over the expiry of application certificates that have used
the `service.alpha.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name` API and regenerate them.

Set the `service.alpha.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name` to the name you
want to use for your secret. Then, your `PodSpec` can mount that secret. When it
is available, your pod will run. The certificate will be good for the internal
service DNS name, `<service.name>.<service.namespace>.svc`. The certificate and
key are in PEM format, stored in ***tls.crt*** and ***tls.key***, respectively.

```
$ oc get secret ssl-key -o yaml

kind: Secret
metadata:
  annotations:
    service.alpha.openshift.io/expiry: 2017-03-19T08:07:07Z
```

When the regenerator finds a certificate that does not have the expiry
annotation, it will regenerate as well. However, the existing secret is not
invalidated. Therefore, no manual intervention is required to get the
regeneration behavior.

See [Service Serving Certificate Secrets](../dev_guide/secrets.html#service-serving-certificate-secrets) for more information.

#### Configurable Expiry Range for Framework Certificates

By default, the certificates used to govern the etcd, master, and kubelet expire
after two to five years. There is now an `oc` command to change this expiry to
be end-user configurable. This has not been implemented in the Ansible installer
yet.

Use the `oc adm ca` command, specifying a validity period greater than two years:

```
# oc adm ca create-master-certs --hostnames=example.org --signer-expire-days=$[365*2+1]`
```

See
[Creating
New Configuration Files](../install_config/master_node_configuration.html#creating-new-configuration-files) for more information.

#### can-i Command and scc-review Command Options

The `can-i` and `scc-review` command options allow users to better understand
their permissions and
[security
context constraints (SCC)](../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#security-context-constraints) setting in their projects. Users see a list of the
commands they are allowed to execute.

The `can-i` command option tests scopes in terms of the user and role. The
`scc-review` command option checks which `ServiceAccount` can create a pod.

`scc-subject-review` can check whether a user or a `ServiceAccount` can create a
pod.

List which permissions a particular user or group has in the project by project
administrator:

```
$ oc policy can-i --list --user=**
$ oc policy can-i --list --groups=**
```

List which permissions a particular user or group has in the project by system
administrator role:

```
$ oc policy can-i --list --user=** -n <project>
$ oc policy can-i --list --groups=**  -n <project>
```

Determine if users can have all the combination of verbs and resources from `oc
policy can-i --list [--user|--groups]`

```
$ oc policy can-i <verb> <resource> --[--user|--groups]
```

Test the SCCs with scopes: `oc policy can-i [--user|--groups]`

```
$ oc policy can-i <verb> <resource> [--user|--groups] --scopes=user:info
$ oc policy can-i <verb> <resource> [--user|--groups] --scopes=user:info,role:admin:<namespace>
$ oc policy can-i <verb> <resource> [--user|--groups] --scopes=role:view:*
$ oc policy can-i <verb> <resource> [--user|--groups] --scopes=role:edit:*
$ oc policy can-i <verb> <resource> [--user|--groups] --scopes=role:admin:*
$ oc policy can-i <verb> <resource> [--user|--groups] --scopes=role:admin:*:!
```

Test with the `ignore-scopes` flag in the `oc policy can-i [--user|--groups]` command:

```
$ oc policy can-i <verb> <resource> [--user|--groups] --ignore-scopes=true
```

The lower-level user cannot list project administrator or system administrator
roles:

```
$ oc policy can-i --list --user project admin
$ oc policy can-i --list --user system:admin
```

Check whether a user or a `ServiceAccount` can create a pod:

```
$ oc policy scc-subject-review -f examples/hello-openshift/hello-pod.json
RESOURCE ALLOWED BY
Pod/hello-openshift restricted
```

See
[Authorization](../dev_guide/authorization.html#dev-guide-authorization-determining-what-you-can-do)
for more information.

#### GitHub Identity Provider Can Optionally Require a Team

Users can now test for GitHub team membership at log in.

There is now a list of one or more GitHub teams to which a user must have
membership in order to authenticate. If specified, only GitHub users that are
members of at least one of the listed teams will be allowed to log in. If this
is not specified, then any person with a valid GitHub account can log in.

See
[Authentication](../admin_solutions/authentication.html#admin-solutions-authentication)
for more information.

### Storage

#### Qualification of External Dynamic Provisioner Interface and Third-party PV

In OpenShift Container Platform 3.5, there is now the qualification of the Kubernetes
interface for an external dynamic provisioner so that Red Hat can support a
customer using a third-party storage solution such as
[NetApp
Trident](../install_config/persistent_storage/dynamically_provisioning_pvs.html#available-dynamically-provisioned-plug-ins).

There is a concept of *in-tree* and *out-of-tree* with
Kubernetes storage. Out-of-Tree means that it is not in the Kubernetes source tree
and does not ship in Kubernetes or OpenShift Container Platform. The ability is provided post-installation.
Many of the third-party storage vendors gravitate towards out-of-tree because it
allows them to ship on their own schedule and own the distribution of their
code.

See
[Available
Dynamically Provisioned Plug-ins](../install_config/persistent_storage/dynamically_provisioning_pvs.html#available-dynamically-provisioned-plug-ins) for more information.

#### Dynamic Provisioner for Azure Block Storage

Dynamic provisioning is now available for Azure block storage. Just like AWS and
GCE, you declare the Azure cloud provider in the ***cloud-config*** file, and then
create `StorageClasses` with the Azure block storage options and connection
information.

Configure the Cloud Provider for Azure
```
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  ...
  apiServerArguments:
    cloud-provider:
      - "azure"
    cloud-config:
      - "/etc/azure/azure.conf"
  controllerArguments:
    cloud-provider:
      - "azure"
    cloud-config:
      - "/etc/azure/azure.conf"
```

Example StorageClass
```
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: slow
provisioner: kubernetes.io/azure-disk
parameters:
  skuName: Standard_LRS
  location: eastus
  storageAccount: azure_storage_account_name
```

See
[Dynamic
Provisioning and Creating Storage Classes](../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_azure.html#install-config-persistent-storage-persistent-storage-azure) for more information.

### Scale

#### Scalability Enhancements for Metrics

With OpenShift Container Platform 3.5, the default value of the `METRICS_RESOLUTION`
parameter is now `30` (seconds). This change was introduced to better match the
cAdvisor housekeeping interval of 30 seconds
[(BZ#1421834)](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1421834).

Increasing the `METRICS_RESOLUTION` interval helped achieve better results in
relation to how many pods can be monitored by one set of metrics pods. In
OpenShift Container Platform 3.5, tests showed that OpenShift metrics collection was stable for
test cases up to 25,000 monitored pods in a OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

See
[Scaling
Cluster Metrics](../scaling_performance/scaling_cluster_metrics.html#scaling-performance-cluster-metrics) for more information.

Currently, up to 100 container native storage (CNS) volumes on one trusted
storage pool (TSP) is supported. For more information, see the
[Persistent
Storage Using GlusterFS](../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_glusterfs.html#container-native-storage-recommendations).

### Networking

#### Multicast Support

OpenShift Container Platform 3.5 introduces multicast support. Pods can now send or receive
traffic with other pods subscribed to the same multicast group.

This requires the **ovs-multitenant** plug-in and only works with annotated
namespaces:

```
netnamespace.network.openshift.io/multicast-enabled: "true"
```

Pods in different tenants can subscribe to same multicast group, but cannot see
each other’s traffic. Administrator tenant (default project) multicast traffic
does not appear in other projects. Overlay (OVS and tenants) and underlay
(virtual machine and a physical server) multicast traffic never mix.

|  | Multicast is best used for low bandwidth coordination or service discovery and not a high-bandwidth solution. |
| --- | --- |

See
[Managing
Networking](../admin_guide/managing_networking.html#admin-guide-networking-multicast) for more information.

#### CLI Understand Wildcard Routes

In OpenShift Container Platform 3.5, there is the added ability to see the subdomain wildcard
routes added in OpenShift Container Platform 3.4, create them, and edit them using the CLI.

Add the wildcard support. Enable this on the router. The default is `off`:

```
$ oc env dc/router ROUTER_ALLOW_WILDCARD_ROUTES=true
```

Create an application or service, then create the wildcard route:

```
$ oc expose svc service-unsecure --wildcard-policy=Subdomain --name=app --hostname=app.example.com
```

Create an edge, passthrough, or reencrypt route, for example:

```
$ oc create route edge edgeroute --service=service-secure --wildcard-policy=Subdomain --hostname=edge.edgeroute.com
```

Test the route:

```
$ curl --resolve edge2.edgeroute.com:443:$router_ip https://edge2.edgeroute.com -k
```

Support was also added to the [web console](../install_config/web_console_customization.html#web-console-enable-wildcard-routes).

#### Allow Host Claims to be Disabled in the Router

This new feature provides the ability to create claims from different namespaces
on the first directory of the path. The goal is to be able to split an
application into different pods running in different namespaces.

This works by providing a way to disable the host claims is sufficient
(initially). The administrator handles the routes and forbids projects from
manipulating them.

For example:

Create a route in namespace 1 with:

* host name `foo.com`
* path= `/bar`

Create a route in namespace 2 with:

* host name `foo.com`
* path= `/foo`

```
namespace 2 →/bar      (1)
namespace 2 →/         (2)
namespace 2 →/bar/test (3)
```

| **1** | Should be rejected. |
| --- | --- |
| **2** | Should be admitted. |
| **3** | Should be admitted. |

|  | This is for controlled environments only. If users can create routes, and they are untrusted, then there is a security concern. |
| --- | --- |

#### Network Policy Plug-in (Technology Preview)

Network Policy (currently in [Technology Preview](#ocp-35-technology-preview))
is an optional plug-in specification of how selections of pods are allowed to
communicate with each other and other network endpoints.

Network Policy works by way of namespace isolation at the network layer using
defined labels. You can also limit connections to specific ports (e.g., only TCP
ports 80 and 443).

```
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: allow-http-and-https
spec:
podSelector:
ingress:
- ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    - port: 80
    - port: 443
```

After installing the Network Policy plug-in, an annotation must first be set on
the namespace, which flips the namespace from `allow all traffic` to `deny all
traffic`. At that point, you can create `NetworkPolicies` that define what
traffic to allow. The annotation is as follows:

```
$ oc annotate namespace ${ns}
'net.beta.kubernetes.io/network-policy={"ingress":{"isolation":"DefaultDeny"}}'
```

With Network Policy in Technology Preview, not all features are available.
Multi-tenant isolation is not available by default. Currently, it must be
configured by creating default isolation policies for each namespace, and there
is currently no clean path to upgrade or migrate from the multi-tenant plug-in.

See
[Managing
Networking](../admin_guide/managing_networking.html#admin-guide-manage-networking) for more information.

#### Ingress Object Support (Technology Preview)

In OpenShift Container Platform 3.5, there is added support for the K8s Ingress object, a set
of rules that allow inbound connections to reach cluster services.

Ingress is disabled in the router, by default. When enabled, Ingress
objects are handled equivalently to routes. The precedence rules apply to both
if they claim the same host name.

|  | To use Ingress, the router must be given permission to read all cluster secrets. |
| --- | --- |

**Example Testing Ingress Object with TLS**

test-secret.yaml
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: test-secret
data:
  tls.crt: `base64 -w 0 /some/path/tls.crt`
  tls.key: `base64 -w 0 /some/path/tls.key`
```

test-ingress.yaml
```
$ cat ingress.yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: test-ingress
spec:
  tls:
  - secretName: test-secret
  backend:
    serviceName: test-service
    servicePort: 8080
```

See
[Ingress
Resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) for more information.

### Installation

OpenShift Container Platform and OpenShift Online operations are now using the same Ansible
upgrade playbooks.

Lots of work around idempotency resulted in an increase in installer and upgrade
stability.

Main features include:

* pre- and post- hooks for master upgrades. Integration points are now added so
  that users can perform
  [custom
  tasks](../install_config/upgrading/automated_upgrades.html#upgrade-hooks), such as cycling hosts in and out of load balancers during the upgrade
  process.
* Open vSwitch (OVS) and etcd version increases.
* Rolling updates of certificates.
* More customization possible during upgrade steps to meet local needs.
* Code refactoring for idempotency.
* Deployment of router shards during installation is now possible. This allows
  administrators to establish swim lanes to specific route shards for labeled
  routes.

### Metrics and Logging

OpenShift Container Platform 3.5 includes enhanced Ansible playbooks to better handle
deployments and upgrades. This deprecates the deployer deployment procedure and
replaces it with Ansible in a manner that is more consistent with the
installation of the rest of the product.

Administrators can declare variables in the inventory file to cause playbooks
***openshift\_metrics.yml*** and ***openshift\_logging.yml*** to behave differently.
The metrics and EFK stacks can be deployed without requiring Java to be
installed on the master node.

Ansible handles:

* Metrics stack for OpenShift Container Platform 3.5.
* Fresh deployment of metrics and logging.
* Upgrading of metrics from OpenShift Container Platform version 3.3 to 3.5 and OpenShift Container Platform
  version 3.4 to 3.5.
* Upgrading of logging from OpenShift Container Platform version 3.3 to 3.4.
* Re-installation of metrics and logging (`cleanup` and `install`).
* Scaling metrics and logging.

See
[Enabling
Cluster Metrics](../install_config/cluster_metrics.html#install-config-cluster-metrics) and
[Aggregating
Container Logs](../install_config/aggregate_logging.html#install-config-aggregate-logging) for more information.

### Developer Experience

#### Pulling Artifacts from Remote Resources

Previously, `oc start-build` only allowed a local file to be specified, but did
not allow a URL to a remote resource. Now, users can pull in artifacts
via `oc start-build --from-file=<some URL>`.

This feature only works against GET-based endpoints that do not require
authentication and use either no transport layer security (TLS), or TLS with a
certificate trusted by the client. This feature does not reinvent `curl`. The
file is downloaded by the CLI, then uploaded to the binary build endpoint.

#### Setting Environment Variables When Creating an Application from a Template

Users now also have the ability to set environment variable when creating an
object (for example, an application) from a template. Previously, this was a
separate step following template creation.

#### Support for -p Parameter Values

Both `oc new-app` and `oc process` now support `-p` for parameter values. The
`-v` flag is deprecated.

#### CI/CD Pipeline

In OpenShift Container Platform 3.5, enablement materials regarding use of CI/CD pipelines
with OpenShift Container Platform are improved. The complexity and number of pipeline samples
provided is increased.

Support is added to `oc new-app` and `oc new-build` so that the commands are
pipeline aware.

![Pipelines Page](data:image/png;base64...)

[Promoting
Applications Across Environments](../dev_guide/application_lifecycle/promoting_applications.html#dev-guide-promoting-applications) and
[Creating New Applications](../dev_guide/application_lifecycle/new_app.html#dev-guide-new-app) for
more information.

#### Default Hard Eviction Thresholds

OpenShift Container Platform uses the following default configuration for `eviction-hard`.

```
...
kubeletArguments:
  eviction-hard:
  - memory.available<100Mi
  - nodefs.available<10%
  - nodefs.inodesFree<5%
  - imagefs.available<15%
...
```

[Handling
Out of Resource Errors](../admin_guide/out_of_resource_handling.html#admin-guide-handling-out-of-resource-errors) for more information.

### Web Console

#### Run and Deploy on OpenShift Container Platform

In OpenShift Container Platform 3.5, there is now a "Run on OpenShift" experience that allows
you to provide external links in the web console to deploy templates.

![Run on OpenShift Buttons](data:image/png;base64...)

Use the URL pattern to select a template or image. You can customize it to have
it come from separate project. The end-user is prompted for the project.

See [Create From
URL](../dev_guide/create_from_url.html#dev-guide-create-from-url) for more information.

#### Added Service Details

There are now added service details on configuration, traffic, routes, and pods.

There is a new section highlighting routes, service and target ports, host name,
and TLS. There is also a section iterating pods and their status.

![Service Details](data:image/png;base64...)

Figure 2. Service Details View

#### ConfigMap: Create, List, Detail

In OpenShift Container Platform 3.5, there is now the ability to
easily work with configuration data decoupled from the container image. You can:

* Create new `ConfigMap`
* List out existing `ConfigMaps`
* Work with the configuration details.
* Easily consume them from various other pages.

![Create a ConfigMap](data:image/png;base64...)

#### Show Build Failures

Users no longer have to search logs to gain a better understanding of why build
failed. Individual build status messages are now updated with details that are
available via the web console and the CLI.

#### StatefulSets (Technology Preview)

Custom resource listing and details pages for `StatefulSets` (formerly known as
`PetSets`) is now available. Users can get details of all `StatefulSets`,
including deployments and replica sets.

See the
[Web
Console](../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.html#web-console-statefulsets) documentation for more information.

## Notable Technical Changes

OpenShift Container Platform 3.5 introduces the following notable technical changes.

### Updated Infrastructure Components

* OpenShift Container Platform 3.5 is supported on RHEL 7.2 and 7.3 with the latest packages
  from Extras, including Docker 1.12.
* OpenShift Container Platform 3.5 is *not* certified with older versions of Docker and RHEL 7.1
  or earlier.
* Kubernetes has been updated to v1.5.
* etcd has been updated to 3.1.
* Open vSwitch (OVS) was upgraded to 2.6 and the package is now provided via the
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux Fast Datapath channel.
### Miscellaneous Changes

* `activeDeadlineSeconds` is now configurable for deployer pods via the deployment
  configuration API.
* In OpenShift Container Platform 3.5, `ScheduledJob` is renamed `CronJob`. If you want to keep
  your scheduled jobs, you need to export them from the 3.4 cluster (using `oc
  export` or `oc get -o yaml`) and create them again, after the upgrade, on the
  3.5 cluster. The storage prefix has changed, along with the name, and newly
  created clusters do not know where to look for `ScheduledJob`. Cluster version
  3.5 operates on `CronJob`, but it also understands `ScheduledJob` submitted to
  it. It performs rapid conversion, saving your newly created object as a
  `CronJob`, resulting in all subsequent read operations returning `CronJob`
  instead. See [Cron Jobs](../dev_guide/cron_jobs.html#dev-guide-cron-jobs) for
  more information.
* The default value for `ingressIPNetworkCIDR` was previously a non-private range
  (`172.46.0.0/16`) and has been changed to a private range (`172.29.0.0/16`).
  Clusters configured with the non-private range run the risk of routing issues,
  and updating to a private range is advised.

  |  | When `ingressIPNetworkCIDR` changes, any external IPs allocated from the previous range will be reallocated from the new range. |
  | --- | --- |
* The `groups` field in the user object is now deprecated. Instead, create Group
  API objects containing the names of the users that are members of the group.
* `oc whoami --token` was deprecated in OpenShift Container Platform 3.4 in favor of `oc whoami
  -t`. Also, `oc whoami --context` is deprecated in favor of `oc whoami -c`. The
  `--token` and `--context` options now behave consistently with all other `oc`
  commands, indicating the specified token or context should be used.
* `extensions/v1beta1.Job` is deprecated in favor of using `batch/v1.Job`. The
  storage should be updated to keep the Jobs readable in future versions of the
  cluster. See
  [Manual
  Upgrades](../install_config/upgrading/manual_upgrades.html#install-config-upgrading-manual-upgrades) for more information.
* OpenShift Container Platform 3.5 requires that the `rhel-7-fast-datapath` repository be
  enabled.
* Template instantiation now respects namespaces defined in the template objects
  (meaning it will create the object in specified namespace) if and only if the
  namespace definition uses a parameter reference. Previously, it never respected
  the namespace defined in the object.

## Bug Fixes

This release fixes bugs for the following components:

**Authentication**

* There was a bug in how policies were listed internally when used to build role
  bindings. Filtering of role bindings based on selectors did not work correctly.
  With this bug fix, the internal listing of policies was updated to the correct
  behavior. As a result, the filtering of role bindings based on selectors now
  works as expected.
  ([**BZ#1423215**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1423215))

**Builds**

* Source-to-Image builds expect image commits to take no longer than two minutes.
  Commits that take longer than two minutes result in a timeout and a failed
  build. With this bug fix, the timeout is removed so that image commits can take
  indeterminate lengths of time. As a result, commits that take an excessive
  amount of time will not result in a failed build.
  ([**BZ#1391665**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1391665))
* The build failure reason was not getting set or saved correctly. Therefore, the
  build failure reason was not shown in command output. The code is now updated to
  correctly save the build failure reason and the build failure reason now shows
  correctly in command output.
  ([**BZ#1415946**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1415946),
  [**BZ#1419810**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1419810))
* Previously, running a custom build with an image containing a Docker binary that
  was a different version than the Docker container running on the
  OpenShift Container Platform node would result in an error. The build would fail with a
  message about mismatched Docker API version. Now, you can set the
  `DOCKER_API_VERSION` environment variable in the `BuildConfig` to match the API
  version running on the node. For example:

  ```
  $ oc set env bc/buildcfg DOCKER_API_VERSION=1.22
  ```

  Note that this will only work if the version of the Docker binary on the custom
  builder image is newer than the version running on the OpenShift Container Platform node.
  ([**BZ#1422798**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1422798))
* The build duration was not being consistently calculated. Therefore, the build
  duration displayed in the web console and on the command line was inaccurate.
  With this bug fix, the duration of completed builds is now consistently
  calculated and a consistent build duration value is reported for builds under
  all circumstances.
  ([**BZ#1318403**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1318403))
* Previously, the `oc new-app` command would try to interpret its argument as a
  path and would exit with an error when a component of this path existed, but was
  not a directory. Running `oc new-app X/Y’ with a file named `X` in the current
  directory would cause an exit with an error, even though `X/Y` denotes a valid
  Docker image. When `oc new-app` tries to interpret the input component as a
  directory and object with that name exists on a file system but is not a
  directory, try another possible interpretation instead of exiting with an error.
  As a result, running `oc new-app X/Y` creates a new application based on Docker
  image X/Y, even in the case when file X exists in the current directory.
  ([**BZ#1347512**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1347512))
* There were different code paths for retrieving and setting the commit
  information. Therefore, the `OPENSHIFT_BUILD_COMMIT` environment variable was
  only set in the output image when the build was triggered by a webhook. To fix
  this issue, use a common code path for retrieving and setting the commit
  information so it is always available to be added to the image. As a result of
  this bug fix, the `OPENSHIFT_BUILD_COMMIT` environment variable is always
  present in the output image.
  ([**BZ#1408879**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1408879))
* Previously, a race condition could cause builds with short-running post-commit
  hooks to hang. This bug fix resolves the issue and builds no longer hang.
  ([**BZ#1425824**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1425824))
* Master returned an internal server error HTTP code when the Docker image lookup
  failed due to unreachable registry. This happened for every image lookup in
  disconnected OpenShift Container Platform environments. Therefore, `oc new-app` reported the
  internal server error as a warning to the user, which can make the user think
  there is something wrong with their OpenShift Container Platform deployment. Change the
  wording of the error `oc new-app` prints to not include the string "internal
  server error". As a result, the warning that is printed does not sound more
  severe than it is.
  ([**BZ#1398330**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1398330))

**Command Line Interface**

* The latest version of Docker for Mac/Windows uses the Community Edition
  versioning scheme. This causes `oc cluster up` to halt with an error because
  the new version cannot be parsed by the `semver` library. This bug fix
  changes the behavior to display a warning instead of exiting with an
  Error. ([**BZ#1428978**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1428978))
* The race condition is seen when updating a batch of nodes in the cluster using
  `oc adm manage-node` to be schedulable or unschedulable. Therefore, several nodes
  could not be updated with the "object has been modified" error. Use a patch on
  the `unschedulable` field of the node object instead of a full update. With this
  bug fix, all nodes can be properly updated as schedulable or unschedulable.
  ([**BZ#1279303**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1279303))
* Previously, the `--overwrite` option for `oc volume` was confusing. This bug fix
  improves the `oc set volume --override` flag description so that users
  understand that they are not replacing the current volume that is being used.
  ([**BZ#1319964**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1319964))
* Previously, a confusing error message was generated when `oc set probe` was run
  without providing a port with a get-url. With this bug fix, the error is now
  formatted to be much more readable to the user.
  ([**BZ#1332871**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1332871))
* The `oc get` command would return the message "No resources found", even in
  cases where resources did exist, but could not be retrieved due to a connection
  error. The command `oc get` was updated to only show the message "No resources
  found" in cases when resources truly did not exist in the server. As a result of
  this bug fix, `oc get` no longer displays "No resources found" in cases when
  there is an error retrieving resources from the server.
  ([**BZ#1393289**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1393289))
* The new responsive terminal would wrap long lines in the output of CLI commands.
  The `oc adm diagnostics` indentation did not work well, and no longer had color in
  its output. This bug fix bypasses the responsive terminal in `oc adm diagnostics`
  (currently only being used in CLI help output). As a result, `oc adm diagnostics`
  now has proper indentation and colorized output.
  ([**BZ#1397995**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1397995))
* Output from the `oc idle` command was confusing to end users. A user could not
  easily tell what was being done by the `oc idle` command. With this bug fix, the
  output of the `oc idle` command was updated to clarify what the command had done
  and is now easier to understand.
  ([**BZ#1402356**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1402356))
* Previously, `oc status` tried to generate a status for the "default" cluster
  namespace if a user had not yet created a project after logging in. The user
  would see a forbidden status error "cannot get projects in project" when their
  context was still in the cluster’s "default" namespace after logging in, and did
  not have permissions to "LIST" in this namespace. With this bug fix, `oc status`
  now checks to see if a user cannot list projects in the default namespace. As a
  result, the user no longer sees the error message "cannot get projects in
  project <default cluster namespace>" when they execute `oc status` and have no
  projects in their current namespace. They instead see a message prompting them
  to create a new project, or to contact their administrator to have one created
  for them.
  ([**BZ#1405636**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1405636))
* After running ` oc adm drain -h`, the user would try to open the provided link
  `http://kubernetes.io/images/docs/kubectl _drain.svg`, but would receive a “404
  page not found” error. This bug fix corrects an extra space in the link path and
  the link now works as expected.
  ([**BZ#1415985**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1415985))
* Although a `MasterConfig` load error is stored globally, it is only printed the
  first time that it is encountered during a diagnostics check. This bug fix
  ensures that, even if the error has already been encountered once, its message
  gets printed in subsequent diagnostic checks.
  ([**BZ#1419472**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1419472))
* Deleting an access token using the **OAuthAccessTokens** client would fail for
  users that had logged in using a **serviceaccount** token. A failure from the
  access token client would prevent the token from being deleted from the local
  configuration, causing a user to be unable to log out. With this bug fix, the
  failure is now logged, ensuring that an attempt to remove the token from the
  user’s local configuration always takes place. A user is now able to log out
  after logging in with a **serviceaccount** token.
  ([**BZ#1422252**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1422252))
* Tags were not sorted according to `http://semver.org/` and, therefore, the
  "highest" tags were not imported when the image import limit was cutting down
  the amount of imported images. With this bug fix, tags are now sorted according
  to semantic versioning rules. The "highest" tags are now properly imported, even
  when only a limited number of tags is allowed to be imported.
  ([**BZ#1339754**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1339754))
* Previously, the ***.kubeconfig*** file was being generated with a server URL that
  did not include a port number. Although the port number was safely assumed to be
  `443` with an HTTPS protocol, it prevented the certificate from being
  successfully verified during the login sequence (an exact match including the
  port was required). Therefore, the user was prompted with the warning "The
  server uses a certificate signed by an unknown authority" every time they
  attempted to log in using an OpenShift Container Platform installation completed through
  `openshift-ansible`. With this bug fix, the command `oc adm create-kubeconfig`
  (used by the `openshift-ansible` playbook) was patched to normalize the server
  URL so that it included the port with the server URL in the generated
  ***.kubeconfig*** file every time. As a result, the user no longer sees the
  message "The server uses a certificate signed by an unknown authority" when
  logging in using a ***.kubeconfig*** file generated by an **openshift-ansible**
  installation.
  ([**BZ#1393943**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1393943))
* There was a duplicated resource "quota" in the `oc describe` list of valid
  resources. Therefore, "quota" was printed twice. This bug fix removes one entry
  on "quota" in the `oc describe` list of valid resources. Now, each resource type
  is only printed once.
  ([**BZ#1396397**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1396397))
* Multi-line output for a template description did not display all lines with
  correct indentation under `oc new-app`. Therefore, the output for template
  descriptions was hard to read. This bug fix added a new helper function
  `formatString`, which indents all lines for a multi-line template description.
  Template descriptions for `oc new-app <my_template>` are now easier to read.
  ([**BZ#1370104**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1370104))
* The `.spec.dockerImageMetadata` field was unnecessarily used when patching an
  image stream tag. As a consequence, the `oc edit` command could not succeed.
  This bug fix modifies the patch mechanism used in `oc edit` to always replace
  the contents of the `.spec.dockerImageMetadata` field. As a result, users should
  be able to invoke `oc edit` on any image stream tag.
  ([**BZ#1403134**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1403134))
* There was previously no information about the `--generator` parameter explaining
  its use in the help output of the `oc expose` command. This bug fix adds an
  explanation that gives example usage
  ([**BZ#1420165**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1420165))

**Containers**

* This enhancement updates the Jenkins examples to remove the need for a slave,
  which makes configuration simpler.
  ([**BZ#1374249**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1374249))

**Deployments**

* The rolling updater was not ignoring pods marked for deletion and was counting
  them as ready. This bug fix updates the rolling updater to ignore such pods.
  ([**BZ#1307004**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1307004))

**Image**

* This enhancement allows Maven and Node.js slave image paths to be specified
  explicitly. Disconnected environments were unable to pull the images from the
  hardcoded paths, so `MAVEN_SLAVE_IMAGE` and `NODEJS_SLAVE_IMAGE` environment
  variables can now be used to control where to pull the images from, overriding
  the hardcoded defaults.
  ([**BZ#1397260**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1397260))

**Image Registry**

* The OpenShift Container Registry (OCR) was not able to handle forwarded headers
  provided by an HAProxy in front of it, making it unusable when exposed on
  insecure port 80. Pushes failed because the registry generated incorrect URLs.
  An upstream fix has been backported to the OCR. As a result, the OCR now handles
  forwarded headers and it is usable again when exposed on an insecure port.
  ([**BZ#1383439**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1383439))
* The master API previously investigated the incorrect object when determining the
  docker image reference of a new image stream mapping when the referenced image
  already existed. This created image stream tags containing misleading
  information about an image’s location, pointing to the original image stream.
  This bug fix updates the master API to now properly determine docker image
  references for new image stream mappings. As a result, image stream tags now
  show proper docker image references pointing to managed images.
  ([**BZ#1408993**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1408993))
* The OpenShift Container Registry (OCR) did not consider insecure import policies
  of image stream tags when deciding whether to fall back to insecure transport
  when serving blobs from external registries. This meant images imported from
  external insecure (no HTTPS or a bad certificate) with an `--insecure` flag
  applied could not be pulled through the OCR. With this bug fix, the OCR now
  considers the insecure import policy of image stream tags where the requested
  image is tagged. As a result, the OCR allows serving images from insecure
  external registries if they are tagged with an insecure import policy.
  ([**BZ#1421954**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1421954))

**Kubernetes**

* Using `hostPath` for storage could lead to running out of disk space, and the
  root disk could become full and unusable. This bug fix adds support for pod
  eviction based on disk space. If a pod using `hostPath` uses too much space, it
  may be evicted from the node.
  ([**BZ#1349311**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1349311))
* Horizontal pod autoscalers (HPAs) would fail to scale when it could not retrieve
  metrics for pods matching its target selector. Therefore, dead pods and newly
  created pods would cause HPAs to skip scaling. This bug fix adds logic to the
  HPA controller which assumes conservative metric values, depending on the state
  of the pod and the direction of the scale, when metrics are missing or pods are
  marked as unready or not active. As a result, newly created or dead pods will no
  longer block scaling.
  ([**BZ#1382855**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1382855))
* Previously, pod evictions due to disk pressure did not resolve until the pod was
  deleted from the API server. This bug fix causes local storage to be freed on
  pod termination (i.e., eviction) rather than pod deletion.
  ([**BZ#1390963**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1390963))
* Previously, I/O could be saturated on a node due to the collection of
  per-container disk stats from a thin pool with a large amount of metadata. This
  bug fix disables the collection of these statistics until such time that an
  efficiently way to collect them can be found.
  ([**BZ#1405347**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1405347))
* Previously, docker could refuse to start new containers due to reaching
  `dm.min_free_space` (default 10%), but the devicemapper thin pool usage did not
  exceed `image-gc-high-threshold` (default 90%), so the image reclaim occurred
  and the node was stuck. This bug fix changes the default
  `image-gc-high-threshold` to 85%, which causes image reclaim to occur before the
  default `dm.min_free_space` is reached.
  ([**BZ#1408309**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1408309))
* The kubelet previously had a fixed constant for how long it would tolerate the
  docker daemon being down before reporting the node as `NotReady`. That was
  previously set to 5 minutes, which meant that it could take up to 5 minutes for
  the kubelet to report it was no longer ready. This bug fix introduces new
  behavior so that the kubelet will wait 30 seconds for the container runtime to
  be down before reporting the node as `NotReady`. As a result, the node now
  reports `NotReady` faster when the docker daemon is down.
  ([**BZ#1418461**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1418461))
* The `oc adm drain --force` command was ignoring any pods that indicated they
  were managed by a daemonset even if the managing daemonset was missing. This bug
  fix updates the command to detect when a daemonset pod is orphaned and warn
  about the missing daemonset rather than generating an error. As a result, the
  command removes orphaned daemonset pods.
  ([**BZ#1424678**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1424678))
* When attempting to connect to etcd to acquire a leader lease, the master
  controllers process only tried to reach a single etcd cluster member even if
  multiple were specified. If the selected etcd cluster member was unavailable,
  the master controllers process was unable to acquire the leader lease and would
  not start up and run properly. This bug fix updates this process to attempt to
  connect to all of the specified etcd cluster members until a successful
  connection is made. As a result, the master controllers process can acquire the
  leader lease and start up properly.
  ([**BZ#1426733**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1426733))
* Excessive logging to the journal caused masters to take longer to restart. This
  bug fix reduces the amount of logging that occurs when initial list/watch
  actions happen against etcd. As a result, the journal is no longer pegged with a
  lot of messages that cause logging messages to be rate limited and dropped.
  Server restart time should be improved on clusters with larger data sets.
  ([**BZ#1427532**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1427532))
* OpenShift Container Platform nodes configured with OpenStack as the cloud
  provider could previously move into `NotReady` state if contact with the
  OpenStack API was lost. With this bug fix, nodes now remain in `Ready` state
  even if the OpenStack API is not responding. Note that a new node process
  configured to use OpenStack cloud integration cannot start without the OpenStack
  API being responsive.
  ([**BZ#1400574**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1400574))
* The admission plug-in `LimitPodHardAntiAffinityTopology` has been disabled by
  default. Enabling it by default previously caused conflict with one of the end
  to end tests.
  ([**BZ#1413748**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1413748))

**Logging**

* The Diagnostic Tool (`oc adm diagnostics`) now correctly reports the presence of
  the `logging-curator-ops` pod. The `logging-curator-ops` was not in the list of
  pods to investigate, resulting in an error that indicated the pod was missing.
  ([**BZ#1394716**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1394716))
* Switching between indices in the Kibana UI now displays the appropriate log
  entries. Because default field mappings were being applied in Elasticsearch, the
  user might receive the `Apply these filters?` error message.
  ([**BZ#1426061**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1426061))

**Web Console**

* The **Browse** tab now shows the local host name of a service.
  ([**BZ#1395821**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1395821))
* On a project’s **Settings** tab, the Quota terminating scope descriptions are not
  clear. The spinning icon on the **Browse** tab that indicates a pod is running no longer
  appears jittery. In some browser/operating system combinations, font and
  line-height issues could make a spinning icon wobble. Those issues have been
  corrected. ([**BZ#1365301**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1365301))
* A link to documentation on using persistent volumes was added to the **Create
  Storage** page.
  ([**BZ#1367718**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1367718))
* If the web console encounters an error updating Hawkular Metrics charts, the
  console will automatically attempt to update again. If the error(s) persist, the
  web console will show an alert at the top of the page with a **Retry** link.
  Previously, the user would need to reload the browser if an update error
  occurred.
  ([**BZ#1388493**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1388493))
* On the web console **About** page, the user can copy the CLI code to log into
  OpenShift Container Platform using the current session token. The token is now permanently hidden
  and the web console now appends the user token if the user copies the CLI
  example using the **Copy to Clipboard** button.
  ([**BZ#1388770**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1388770))
* The web console now displays any Kubernetes `StatefulSet` objects (formerly
  called `PetSets`) in a project with the same level of detail as other resources.
  ([**BZ#1393202**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1393202))
* On the **Create Secret** page, if the user uploads a file that is not a properly
  formed file, the **Create** button will now be disabled. Previously, the **Create**
  button was enabled if an improper file was uploaded.
  ([**BZ#1400775**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1400775))
* The screen to edit a JSON-formatted template in YAML format now displays the
  entire template file in YAML. Previously, because of space restrictions, some of
  the JSON formatting would not be converted to YAML.
  ([**BZ#1402260**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1402260))
* When a build is in the **Pending** state, the **Duration** time will not be
  calculated. The duration time starts when the build changes to **Running**. This
  change was made to prevent negative duration times that could arise from
  differences in the browser clock time and the server clock time.
  ([**BZ#1404417**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1404417))
* Previously, under specific circumstances, a single build could appear twice in
  the **Overview** page of the web console. The web console now correctly lists each
  specific build one time on the **Overview** page.
  ([**BZ#1410662**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1410662))
* In the JVM console, for Apache Camel diagrams, the **Breakout suspended at**
  slideout window can be closed and appears only when a breakout is suspended.
  Previously, the window could not be closed, which could prevent the user from
  selecting Camel route elements.
  ([**BZ#1411296**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1411296))
* The web console now validates deployment controller and replication controller
  memory limits that are specified in kB. Previously, validation of memory units
  in kB would incorrectly fail as being too small for the limit range. This
  happened only for kB, and not other memory units.
  ([**BZ#1413516**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1413516))
* The links to the documentation in the web console now point to the correct
  product. Previously, the links led to the OpenShift Origin documentation.
  ([**BZ#1426061**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1426061))
* When editing a deployment configuration (DC) through the web console, the memory
  unit is properly retained. Previously, the requested memory was not retained.
  ([**BZ#1413842**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1413842))
* Project display names that contain less than (<) and greater than (>) characters
  always display in the **Choose Existing Project** list. Previously, if a display
  names contained these characters in a way that mimicked HTML (such as:
  `<displayname>`) would result in the display name not appearing or not appearing
  correctly in the list.
  ([**BZ#1414195**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1414195))
* Client-side validation for persistent volume claim limit ranges has been added
  to the "Create Storage" page in the web console allowing the user to specify
  minimum and maximum values for capacity.
  ([**BZ#1414229**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1414229))
* When using self-defined stage names for a pipeline, the `stage` parameter must
  include a block argument, for example: `stage('build is the greatest stage') {}`
  in the Jenkinsfile.
  ([**BZ#1414661**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1414661))
* Name validation in the web console is now consistent with the CLI. Periods are
  now allowed in the names, and the maximum length has been increased to 253
  characters. Previously, the validation in the web console was more strict than
  in the CLI. Validation has been relaxed for the following forms in the web
  console to match the command line:

  + Add Autoscaler
  + Add Storage
  + Create Config Map
  + Create Route
  + Create Secret
    ([**BZ#1414691**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1414691))
* In the JVM Console, the **Preference** button in the User page of the JVM Console
  has been added back to the interface. Previously, the **Preferences** button was
  missing.
  ([**BZ#1415463**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1415463))
* In the web console, when deploying an application based on an image, the **Next
  Step** page correctly appears. Previously, the web console would incorrectly
  redirect to the **Overview** page.
  ([**BZ#1415602**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1415602))
* The web console now displays an error message when a user with an unauthorized
  role tries to grant the `serviceaccount:builder` role to a user. Previously, the
  web console did not display an error message.
  ([**BZ#1420247**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1420247))
* If you accessed the **Build Configuration** edit page using the page URL, the
  **Create New Secret** button correctly appears. Previously, if you accessed the
  edit page using the URL, the **Create New Secret** button would not appear.
  ([**BZ#1421097**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1421097))
* Logs in the web console for a pod with multiple containers have been fixed to
  address a situation where it was possible for log output from more than one
  container to appear.
  ([**BZ#1427289**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1427289))
* The pod metrics graph for CPU in the web console would not render if there is
  zero CPU activity. Previously, the graph line would not connect to the zero
  baseline.
  ([**BZ#1427360**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1427360))
* On the **Application Deployment** page, the annotations associated with the
  deployment might appear truncated in the **Show Annotations** list, if the
  annotation is too long. Click the **See All** button to display the full
  annotation or **Collapse** to hide the truncated section of the annotation.
  ([**BZ#1233511**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1233511))
* In the web console, environment variables in the build file are no longer
  truncated after the `=` character. Previously, the environment variable values
  that contained an `=` character were being truncated.
  ([**BZ#1357107**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1357107))
* In the pod metrics page, the donut chart for current usage now appears to the
  right of the metrics sparkline. The new position allows you to see more metric
  data on the screen. Previously the donut chart was above the sparkline.
  ([**BZ#1387286**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1387286))
* Previously, some changes to a health check command or deployment hook command in
  the web console would not be saved. This happened when editing an existing
  command and adding or removing a single argument. The web console has been fixed
  to correctly save all edits to health check and deployment hook commands.
  ([**BZ#1411258**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1411258))
* Previously, you had to enter weights between `0` and `256` as integer values.
  When creating or editing routes that send traffic to two services in the web
  console, you can now specify the service weights as percentages using a slider
  control. You can still enter integer weights if desired.
  ([**BZ#1416882**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1416882))
* On the **Add to Project** page of the web console, if you entered an invalid
  setting for some advanced options, then hide the advanced options, the form
  would be submitted with invalid values, causing errors when creating some
  resources like horizontal pod autoscalers. The web console has been changed to
  correctly validate these fields so that you cannot submit the form with invalid
  values. ([**BZ#1419887**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1419887))
* Previously, the link to download the OpenShift CLI linked to the incorrect
  version (of OpenShift Origin). The link has been updated, and the link downloads
  the correct version.
  ([**BZ#1421949**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1421949))
* Previously, the **Create a Secret** and **Add Config Files** buttons when creating
  using the web console mistakenly linked to the other page. The buttons have been
  corrected.
  ([**BZ#1425728**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1425728))
* Dates now use the word form over the number form to avoid ambiguity (For example,
  May 4, 2016 instead of 05/04/2017).
  ([**BZ#1333101**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1333101))
* Previously, dropdown menus on the web console overlay the navigation menu
  dropdowns, blocking the view and usability of the navigation menu dropdowns. The
  navigation menu dropdown’s z-index has been set to a value greater than that of
  page content dropdowns, resulting in navigation menu dropdowns to always appear
  on top of page content dropdowns.
  ([**BZ#1366090**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1366090))
* A DOM element under the label filter component was being removed during certain
  navigation situations, preventing the **Clear Filters** link from appearing until
  the browser was refreshed. The correct element is now removed under these
  navigation situations meaning the **Clear Filters** link will always appear when
  any label filters are active.
  ([**BZ#1375862**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1375862))
* When using the **Deploy Image** tab from the **Add to Project** page, changing the
  name input value no longer causes the displayed image name to change. The
  correct image name is now displayed.
  ([**BZ#1403097**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1403097))

**Metrics**

* Previously, the Heapster image and pod did not specify the user it should be run
  under and defaulted to using the root user. If the user is running with the
  `MustRunAsNonRoot` SCC, then it would fail since it its not allowed to be run as
  a root user. This bug fix ensured it would specify a default user for the
  Heapster image meaning users can run with the `MustRunAsNonRoot` SCC without
  issues. ([**BZ#1393103**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1393103))
* The Hawkular Metrics log data was missing the date in its timestamps. This bug
  fix enables the timestamps in the logs.
  ([**BZ#1423014**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1423014),
  [**BZ#1427666**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1427666))
* Previously, JDK and Cassandra could not determine the filesize for extremely
  large filesystems, such as EFS, because Cassandra tries to and read the
  filesystem size when it configures itself, but notices the invalid size and fail
  to start properly. Cassandra has been patched to work around the failure
  encountered and will be able to start on systems that are using extremely large
  filesystems.
  ([**BZ#1418748**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1418748))

**Networking**

* Previously, wildcard route support was not exposed in the CLI. This fix enables
  support, meaning you can now create wildcard routes in the CLI.
  ([**BZ#1391786**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1391786))
* Previously, unidling connections could time out if the pod took longer than 30s
  to start, because clients had connections closed with no data. The timeout has
  been increased to 120 seconds so that slow pods do not break clients.
  ([**BZ#1416037**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1416037))
* To be consistent with edge routes, this bug fix makes is possible to configure
  insecure termination for all types of routes from the CLI.
  ([**BZ#1403155**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1403155))
* This bug feature adds an environment variable to configure haproxy router
  logging facility, so that the syslog facility can be set. Now, users can
  separate log traffic as desired.
  ([**BZ#1419127**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1419127))
* Previously, the CIDR for multicast addresses was incorrect. Leading to
  addresses that were in the mis-claimed portion being treated incorrectly, as
  multicast would not work. This fix allows the range to be the IETF assigned one
  (per RFC 5771), meaning that addresses that were in the wrong portion of the
  range now work.
  ([**BZ#1420032**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1420032))

**REST API**

* Previously, there was a code difference with the code used to build the root
  etcd prefix between etcdv2 and etcdv3. This resulted in, when migrating from
  etcdv2 to etcdv3, the cluster not being able to find any data if a root etcd
  prefix was used that did not start with a "/" (which is the default case for
  OpenShift). Now, the same code is used to build the root etcd prefix for both
  etcdv2 and etcdv3, meaning that after a migration, the cluster is able to find
  migrated data as expected.
  ([**BZ#1393744**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1393744))

**Routing**

* The max connection was too low, causing the pod to restart. With this fix,
  the default value of the connection was increased. As a result, the pod does not
  restart.
  ([**BZ#1405440**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1405440))
* Previously, if you created two ipfailover instances and had them run on the same
  node, it would fail because both would to use hostPort 1985. This was corrected
  by using the ServicePort as a mechanism to prevent multiple pods for same
  configuration from starting on the same node.
  ([**BZ#1411501**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1411501))
* Previously, as routers were removed, the route status was not regularly cleared.
  This fix added a script to clean out the defunct route status, and documented
  expectations of operators. As a result, route statuses are clear and correct.
  ([**BZ#1356819**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1356819))
* Previously, permissions would reset to preset values on a periodic basis causing
  the scripts to lose execute permissions. This fix set the correct preset value
  in the RC.
  ([**BZ#1408172**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1408172))
* Previously, default host name generation did not take into account that routes
  could have the "." character. Therefore when a generated host name was used for
  a route that included a "." in the name, and had allowed `wildcardpolicy`, there
  would be an extra subdomain. This fix changed the host name generator to replace "."
  in a route’s name to "-" in the generated host name. As a result, generated host
  names cannot create additional subdomains.
  ([**BZ#1414956**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1414956))
* To match user expectations, this feature makes the default for routes with
  multiple active services be round-robin. Without this feature, users needed to
  set an annotation on a route as well as weights to make it behave correctly.
  ([**BZ#1416869**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1416869))
* Previously, re-encryption routes were not correctly supporting redirect access
  from HTTP to HTTPS. As a result, it was not possible to set a re-encrypt routes
  insecure termination policy to redirect. The HAproxy template file was edited to
  correctly implement redirect as a valid insecure termination policy for redirect
  routes. Now re-encrypt routes can be configured to redirect HTTP to HTTPS
  traffic.
  ([**BZ#1317159**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1317159))

**Storage**

* Previously, the Azure provisioner was not enabled, causing a failure to
  provision Azure disks. This fix enabled the Azure provisioner. As a result, it
  is now able to provision Azure disks.
  ([**BZ#1415466**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1415466))
* Previously, OpenShift Container Platform used the wrong `InstanceID` for checking that
  volumes were attached to nodes, causing it to think that a volume was detached
  while it is still attached. This resulted in volumes remaining attached when
  they were not needed, and unable to be deleted according to their reclaim
  policy. With this fix, OpenShift Container Platform now uses the right `InstanceID` for all
  attach, detach, and check operations. And as a result, volumes are detached and
  deleted when they are not needed.
  ([**BZ#1420645**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1420645))
* Previously, **ceph-common** packages were not installed in the infra container,
  causing failure to provision Ceph RBD volumes. With this fix, **ceph-common**
  packages are installed in the infra container. As a result, Ceph RBD volumes now
  provision correctly.
  ([**BZ#1420698**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1420698))
* Previously, the AWS device IDs were incorrect. This caused failure to attach EBS
  volume due to `InvalidParameterValue` for the parameter device. This fix updated
  the AWD device IDs, and as a result, the EBS volume is successfully attached.
  ([**BZ#1422457**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1422457))
* Previously, OpenShift Container Platform contained a race condition in NFS recycler handling.
  This caused some pods to fail to start, and failed to recycle the corresponding
  NFS share when recycler pods for multiple NFS shares were started at the same
  time. With this fix, the race condition was corrected. As a result, all
  scheduled NFS recycler pods are started and NFS shares are recycled.
  ([**BZ#1392338**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1392338))
* Previously, the device name provided by Cinder was being used for volume
  mounting into a pod, however, the device name provided by Cinder is unreliable
  for the actual mounting. This caused some Cinder volumes to fail to be mounted
  into a pod, and resulted in an inconclusive message to appear in the logs. This
  fix enables a detection to be performed using the Cinder ID. As a result, Cinder
  volumes are reliably being mounted into appropriate pods.
  ([**BZ#1408867**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1408867))
* Previously, the same iSCSI device could not successfully be used by multiple
  pods on same node. When one pod would shut down, the iSCSI device for the other
  pod would be unavailable. The code was changed with this fix. As a result, the
  iscsi device are successfully run.
  ([**BZ#1426778**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1426778),
  [**BZ#1426775**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1426775))
* Previously, if a mount was in progress and pod was deleted, the pod would fail
  to be cleaned up properly. This meant the pod was left with volumes attached to
  the node. This fix makes sure that the pending operation is completed before
  volume is unmounted from node. As a result, the pod gets cleaned up properly
  even if mount was in flight when deletion request is received.
  ([**BZ#1432949**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1432949))

## Technology Preview Features

Some features in this release are currently in Technology Preview. These
experimental features are not intended for production use. Please note the
following scope of support on the Red Hat Customer Portal for these features:

[Technology Preview
Features Support Scope](https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview)

The following new features are now available in Technology Preview:

* [Kubelet Collection of Node Attributes for Scheduling Considerations](#ocp-35-kubelet-collection-of-node-attriutes-for-scheduling-considerations)
* [`StatefulSets`](#ocp-35-statefulsets)
* [Application Service Certificate Regeneration](#ocp-35-application-service-cert-regeneration)
* [Network Policy Plug-in](#ocp-35-network-policy)
* [Kubelet Collection of Node Attributes for Scheduling Considerations](#ocp-35-kubelet-collection-of-node-attriutes-for-scheduling-considerations)
* [Ingress Object Support](#ocp-35-ingress-object-support)
* [Init
  containers](../architecture/core_concepts/containers_and_images.html#init-containers)

The following features that were formerly in Technology Preview from a previous
OpenShift Container Platform release remain in Technology Preview:

* [Kubernetes
  Deployments Support](../dev_guide/deployments/kubernetes_deployments.html#dev-guide-kubernetes-deployments-support)
  -[Pod Distribution Budgets](../admin_guide/managing_pods.html#managing-pods-poddisruptionbudget)
* [Cron Jobs (formerly called Scheduled Jobs)](../dev_guide/cron_jobs.html#dev-guide-cron-jobs)

See more details on [technical changes related
to Cron Jobs](#ocp-35-miscellaneous-changes) in OpenShift Container Platform 3.5.

## Known Issues

* In OpenShift Container Platform 3.4, the master connected to the etcd cluster using the host
  name of the etcd endpoints. In OpenShift Container Platform 3.5, the master now connects to
  etcd via IP address. When configuring a cluster to use proxy settings, this
  change causes the master-to-etcd connection to be proxied as well, rather than
  being excluded by host name in each host’s `NO_PROXY` setting.

  Workarounds for setting the IP addresses manually in each host’s `NO_PROXY`
  setting are documented in the installation and upgrade steps. The installer will
  be updated in a future release to handle this scenario automatically during
  installation and upgrades. ([**BZ#1466783**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1466783))

## Asynchronous Errata Updates

Security, bug fix, and enhancement updates for OpenShift Container Platform 3.5 are released
as asynchronous errata through the Red Hat Network. All OpenShift Container Platform 3.5
errata is [available on the Red
Hat Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/). See the
[OpenShift Container Platform
Life Cycle](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift) for more information about asynchronous errata.

Red Hat Customer Portal users can enable errata notifications in the account
settings for Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM). When errata notifications
are enabled, users are notified via email whenever new errata relevant to their
registered systems are released.

|  | Red Hat Customer Portal user accounts must have systems registered and consuming OpenShift Container Platform entitlements for OpenShift Container Platform errata notification emails to generate. |
| --- | --- |

This section will continue to be updated over time to provide notes on
enhancements and bug fixes for future asynchronous errata releases of
OpenShift Container Platform 3.5. Versioned asynchronous releases, for example with the form
OpenShift Container Platform 3.5.z, will be detailed in subsections. In addition, releases in
which the errata text cannot fit in the space provided by the advisory will be
detailed in subsections that follow.

### RHBA-2017:0903 - atomic-openshift-utils Bug Fix and Enhancement Update

Issued: 2017-04-12

OpenShift Container Platform bug fix and enhancement advisory
[RHBA-2017:0903](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2017%3A0903), providing
updated **atomic-openshift-utils**, **ansible**, and **openshift-ansible** packages
that fix several bugs and add enhancements, is now available.

Space precluded documenting all of the bug fixes and enhancements for this
release in the advisory. See the following sections for notes on upgrading and
details on the bug fixes and enhancements included in this release.

#### Upgrading

To apply this update, run the following on all hosts where you intend to
initiate Ansible-based installation or upgrade procedures:

```
# yum update atomic-openshift-utils
```

#### Bug Fixes

* When CloudFront was enabled, the installer did not use the private key for the registry, and the registry failed to deploy successfully. This bug fix adds new steps to ensure the private key creates a secret and attaches to the CloudFront registry. ([**BZ#1395168**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1395168))
* Previously, the facts generation procedures may have incorrectly determined major release versions prior to package installation. Because the playbooks are now version specific, this defaulting has been eliminated, ensuring that OpenShift Container Platform 3.5 playbooks receive 3.5 content in all scenarios. ([**BZ#1395637**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1395637))
* OpenShift Container Platform 3.4 and 3.3 introduced a requirement on the `conntrack` executable, but this dependency was not enforced at install time. This made it possible for service proxy management to fail post installation. This bug fix updates the installer to ensure that `conntrack` is installed. ([**BZ#1420182**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1420182))
* An Ansible release introduced a regression that caused datastructures to fail to serialize when writing them out to a YAML document. Users would trigger the regression during the pre-run fact fetching, causing their installation to crash. Ansible introduced a new YAML serializing system in an update. The old serializing system was replaced with the new one, `AnsibleDumper`. As a result, the quick installer can run the "Gathering information from hosts" actions now without triggering the error during serializing. ([**BZ#1420970**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1420970))
* Previously, if `ansible_user` was a Windows domain user in the format of `dom\user`, the installation playbooks would fail. This bug fix escapes this user name properly, ensuring playbooks run successfully. ([**BZ#1426703**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1426703))
* In containerized environments, the CNI data directory located at ***/var/lib/cni*** was not properly configured to persist on the node host. This bug fix updates the installer to ensure that pod IP allocation data is persisted when restarting containerized nodes. ([**BZ#1427789**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1427789))
* The command line option that flags unattended mode was not being checked when the scaleup routine was ran, and users would be prompted to enter host information. This bug fix ensures the unattended mode flag is checked during the scaleup routine. As a result, users are kicked out and given instructions on how to continue if the unattended mode flag is set during a scaleup run. ([**BZ#1390135**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1390135))
* A `when` clause was present on the **firewalld** service installation task, causing the installation to be skipped for **firewalld** when running a containerized install. This bug fix removes the `when` clause from the **firewalld** installation task, and as a result **firewalld** is installed properly when running a containerized install. ([**BZ#1413447**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1413447))
* A custom systemd unit file was used for the **docker** service specifying `Requires=iptables`. This resulted in the **docker** service being restarted when **iptables** was restarted. This bug fix updates the custom systemd unit file to specify `Wants=iptables`. This will still ensure that **iptables** is started before **docker**, but will not cause **docker** to restart when **iptables** is restarted. ([**BZ#1416156**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1416156))
* Re-running the installation playbook with `openshift_hosted_logging_deploy=true` would redeploy the logging deployer pod using the install mode and would fail because logging was already installed. The Ansible playbook fails due to waiting on the deployer pod to complete successfully. In OpenShift Container Platform 3.5, the logging deployer pod is no longer used to install logging, but rather the `openshift_logging` role. As a result, it is able to handle previously installed logging, and the playbook now completes successfully. ([**BZ#1417525**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1417525))
* The fact `etcd_is_atomic` was detected incorrectly due to the role ordering of some fact setting operations. Atomic Host systems do not support yum, repoquery, and rpm commands; Atomic Host systems would attempt to run commands specific to managing and inspecting repositories and packages when they should not. This bug fix changes the ordering of role calls and fact updates and wrapped in a meta-role to ensure they stay in the correct order. As a result, Atomic Host systems will no longer attempt to run the problematic commands, because the `etcd_is_atomic` fact is now correctly detected. ([**BZ#1427067**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1427067))
* Previously, **atomic-openshift-docker-excluder** was disabled before the **docker** installation, and **docker** could be installed with newer version that is not compatible. This bug fix enables **atomic-openshift-docker-excluder** during the **docker** installation so that **docker** is installed with a version that is compatible. ([**BZ#1430612**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1430612))
* Previously, **atomic-openshift-excluder** was not enabled after installation, meaning OpenShift Container Platform components were not protected from accidental package updates. This bug fix enables **atomic-openshift-excluder** correctly. ([**BZ#1430613**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1430613))
* The example inventories were incorrect for the logging public master URL, and `loggingPublicURL` was not being set as expected. This bug fix updates the example inventories to be accurate for the new logging role. As a result, `loggingPublicURL` is correctly set as expected. ([**BZ#1430628**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1430628))
* Previously, the **atomic-openshift-excluder** and **atomic-openshift-docker-excluder** packages were not acknowledged during node or master scale-up. This meant that these excluder packages were not installed on new nodes or masters. This bug fix ensures that the excluder packages are installed on new nodes and masters as well. As a result, the excluder packages are installed on new nodes and masters when scaling up. ([**BZ#1432868**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1432868))
* The quick installer used a system for counting the number of plays in a run that was not 100% accurate due to conditional play includes. The reported number of plays could be bigger or smaller than the original estimate. With this bug fix, at the end of the playbook run, the installer now explains why the actual play count may be different than the estimate. Users still have an idea of about how far along their install is and if the number of tasks do not match the original estimate they understand why. ([**BZ#1388739**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1388739))
* A bug was fixed in the **openvswitch** upgrade to v2.6 ([**BZ#1420636**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1420636))
* Automatic migration is not possible from `PetSets` to `StatefulSets`. An additional validation step was added to the pre-upgrade validation playbook. `PetSets` are searched for in the cluster and if any existing `PetSets` are detected, the installation errors and quits. The user is given an information message (including documentation references) describing what went wrong, why, and what the users choices are for continuing the upgrade without migrating `PetSets`. ([**BZ#1428229**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1428229))
* In some situations, node upgrade could terminate a running pod that was upgrading the router or registry, causing the router or registry to fail to upgrade. The router and registry upgrade is now re-ordered to follow node upgrade when performing a full cluster in-place upgrade. As a result, nodes are no longer taken offline for upgrade while the router or registry is still running. ([**BZ#1395081**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1395081))
* Previously, an error in the upgrade playbooks prevented ansible from detecting when a host had successfully been rebooted. This error has been corrected and upgrades that use `openshift_rolling_restart_mode=system` now work properly. ([**BZ#1421002**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1421002))
* The **atomic-openshift-excluder** and **atomic-openshift-docker-excluder** packages are now updated to the latest available packages when upgrading OpenShift Container Platform. ([**BZ#1426070**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1426070))
* The **atomic-openshift-docker-excluder** package was not updated during containerized cluster upgrades. If this package was not up to date, the cluster was not protected from accidentally upgrading to an unsupported **docker** version. This bug fix ensures the package is now updated during containerized upgrade. ([**BZ#1430700**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1430700))
* Previously, **tar** was not listed as a dependency for the installer. On systems where **tar** was not part of the base system, the installer could fail. This bug fix adds **tar** as a dependency, and as a result the installer is now able to use **tar** during installations and upgrades. ([**BZ#1388445**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1388445))
* The upgrade plays were updating the excluder packages on Atomic Host systems. This caused the plays to fail as the excluders are not supported on Atomic Host. This bug fix skips excluders on Atomic Host systems, and as a result these plays no longer fail. ([**BZ#1431077**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1431077))
* The default **docker** log driver has been changed to **journald** in order to provider higher performance and lower logging latency. ([**BZ#1388191**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1388191))
* Previously, the file specified in `openshift_master_ca_certificate` was not deployed when performing a master scaleup. The scaleup playbooks have been updated to ensure that this certificate is deployed. ([**BZ#1427003**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1427003), [**BZ#1426677**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1426677))
* When using `grep` to find `pluginOrderOverride` within the ***/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml*** file, if the string was not found the task failed, causing the playbook to fail. This bug fix updates the task to no longer fail if the RC != 0 (the string was not found). As a result, if the string is missing, the playbook no longer fails and instead continues to run as expected. ([**BZ#1425400**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1425400))
* Previously, the registry certificate was not properly updated when running the certificate re-deploy playbooks, which may have prevented pushing or pulling images. This bug fix updates the playbooks to ensure that the registry certificate is correctly updated. ([**BZ#1418191**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1418191))
* Previously, the installer may have failed to add **iptables** rules if other **iptables** rules were being updated at the same time. This bug fix updates the installer to wait to obtain a lock when updating **iptables** rules, ensuring that rules are properly created. ([**BZ#1415800**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1415800))
* The certificate re-deploy playbooks have been updated to ensure all internal certificates have been updated and, when possible, the update is done in a rolling manner, preventing downtime. See [Redeploying Certificates](../install_config/redeploying_certificates.html#install-config-redeploying-certificates) for the latest information on updating certificates. ([**BZ#1397958**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1397958))
* The registry console deployment now allows both the prefix and version to be specified if the user needs to reference an alternate registry or specific version of the registry console. These values may be configured by setting, for example, `openshift_cockpit_deployer_prefix='registry.example.com/openshift'` and `openshift_cockpit_deployer_version='3.5.0'`, which would result in use of `registry.example.com/openshift/registry-console:3.5.0`. ([**BZ#1383275**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1383275))

#### Enhancements

* This enhancement enables the `gitNoProxy` default value for builds to be set explicitly via the installer. Previously, the value was inherited from the `no_proxy` settings for the installer, which was insufficiently configurable. The build default `gitNoProxy` value can now be directly controlled by the `openshift_builddefaults_git_no_proxy` setting. ([**BZ#1384753**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1384753))
* This enhancement adds the new option `openshift_docker_selinux_enabled`. This allows users to override the default installation **docker** options setting of `--selinux-enabled`. Placing `openshift_docker_selinux_enabled=false` in user inventory file will remove the `--selinux-enabled` docker option. ([**BZ#1392742**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1392742))

the advisory. See the following sections for notes on upgrading and details on
the bug fixes and images included in this release.

#### Upgrading

To upgrade an existing OpenShift Container Platform 3.4 or 3.5 cluster to this latest release, use the
automated upgrade playbook. See
[Performing Automated In-place Cluster Upgrades](../install_config/upgrading/automated_upgrades.html#running-the-upgrade-playbook-directly) for instructions.

#### Bug Fixes

* Containers were being force killed by the build process. Some container resources were not freed when they were force killed, resulting in resource exhaustion and the inability to run new builds. Containers are now gracefully killed, allowing them to clean up their resources. Resource exhaustion no longer occurs and builds continue to run normally. ([**BZ#1437121**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1437121))
* The OpenShift Container Registry (OCR) takes the `dockerImageReference` from an image object. The `dockerImageReference` is shared across image streams and the same image is fetched using the same `dockerImageReference` for all image streams. Now, the `dockerImageReference` is taken from an image stream. OCR fetches the image from different places for different image streams. ([**BZ#1433232**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1433232))
* This bug fix adjusted conditionals to allow audit configuration for non-HA environments. ([**BZ#1447019**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1447019))
* Missing rules in the Network Policy SDN plug-in did not allow proper off-cluster access. Off-cluster resources were not reachable. The rules are corrected and resources accessible. ([**BZ#1445500**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1445500))
* Multiple node IP addresses were reported in random order by node status. Consequently, the SDN controller picked up a random one each time. This bug fix maintains the stickiness of the IP once it is chosen until valid, and IP addresses are no longer switched unexpectedly. ([**BZ#1451830**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1451830))
* The ARP cache size tuning parameters were not set when performing an installation on bare metal hosts. The bare metal profiles are now updated to ensure that the ARP cache is set correctly on bare metal hosts. ([**BZ#1452235**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1452235))
* If the pod was using a persistent volume and had been deleted while the controller was down, the volume was never detached from the node. The restarted controller was not able to find the attached volume and never tried to detach it. Now, the fixed controller examines the node volumes on startup, determines which ones need to be detached, then detaches them properly. ([**BZ#1377486**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1377486))
* Volumes attached to non-running AWS instances were being incorrectly marked as detached by a periodic routine that verified if volumes were attached because non-running AWS instances were not considered nodes by the routine. Volumes that were incorrectly marked detached were never detached if or when they needed to be later. By considering non-running AWS instances to be nodes in the routine, the issue is fixed. Volumes attached to non-running AWS instances are correctly tracked as attached and will be detached when they need to be later. ([**BZ#1455675**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1455675))

### RHBA-2017:1666 - atomic-openshift-utils Bug Fix and Enhancement Update

Issued: 2017-06-29

OpenShift Container Platform bug fix and enhancement advisory
[RHBA-2017:1666](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2017%3A1666), providing
updated **atomic-openshift-utils** and **openshift-ansible** packages that fix
several bugs and add an enhancement, is now available.

Space precluded documenting all of the bug fixes and enhancements for this
release in the advisory. See the following sections for notes on upgrading and
details on the bug fixes and enhancements included in this release.

#### Upgrading

To apply this update, run the following on all hosts where you intend to
initiate Ansible-based installation or upgrade procedures:

```
# yum update atomic-openshift-utils
```

#### Bug Fixes

* During control plan upgrades, a subset of pre-check and verification tasks for upgrades is run. However, the tasks were run over non-control plane nodes as well. Some of the tasks need **\*-excluder** RPMs to be disabled in order to work properly. Given the excluders are disabled on control plane hosts only, the tasks run over the remaining nodes caused a failure. With this bug fix, all pre-check and verification tasks are run over control plane nodes only. ([**BZ#1440167**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1440167))
* Starting with OpenShift Container Platform 3.4, OpenShift’s SDN plug-ins no longer reconfigure the `docker` bridge MTU; instead, pods are configured properly on creation. Because of this change, non-OpenShift containers may have an MTU configured that is too large to allow access to hosts on the SDN. This bug fix updates the installer to align the MTU setting for the `docker` bridge with the MTU used inside the cluster, thus avoiding the problem. ([**BZ#1460235**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1460235))
* The OpenShift CA redeployment playbook (***playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/redeploy-openshift-ca.yml***) would fail to restart services if certificates were previously expired. This bug fix ensures that service restarts are now skipped within the OpenShift CA redeployment playbook when expired certificates are detected. Expired cluster certificates may be replaced with the certificate redeployment playbook (***playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/redeploy-certificates.yml***) after the OpenShift CA certificate has been replaced via the OpenShift CA redeployment playbook. ([**BZ#1460969**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1460969))
* Previously, installation would fail in multi-master environments in which the load balanced API was listening on a different port than that of the OpenShift Container Platform API and web console. This bug fix accounts for this difference and ensures the master loopback client configuration is configured to interact with the local master. ([**BZ#1462276**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1462276))
* The use of `oc patch` to update router images was setting additional configuration items to defaults, even if they were configured differently in the environment. This bug fix converts those tasks to use Ansible modules, which are much more precise and change only the provided parameter. ([**BZ#1462721**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1462721))
* When using the `openshift_upgrade_nodes_label` variable during upgrades, if the label did not match any hosts, the upgrade would silently proceed with upgrading all nodes given. This bug fix verifies the provided label matches a set of hosts prior to upgrading, and the upgrade fails if no nodes match. ([**BZ#1462995**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1462995))
* During certificate expiration checking or redeployment, certificiates with large serial numbers could not be parsed using the existing manual parser workaround on hosts that were missing the OpenSSL python library. This bug fix updates the manual parser to account for the format of certificates with large serial numbers. As a result, these certificates can now be parsed. ([**BZ#1464543**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1464543))

#### Enhancements

* Previously, it was only possible to redeploy the etcd CA certificate by also redeploying the OpenShift CA certificate, which was unnecessary maintenance. With this enhancement, the etcd CA certificate may now be replaced independent of the OpenShift CA certificate using the etcd CA certificate redeployment playbook (***playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/redeploy-etcd-ca.yml***). Note that the OpenShift CA redeployment playbook (***playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/redeploy-openshift-ca.yml***) now only replaces the OpenShift CA certificate. Similarly, the etcd CA redeployment playbook only redeploys the etcd CA certificate. ([**BZ#1463772**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1463772))

### RHBA-2017:1640 - OpenShift Container Platform 3.5.5.31 Bug Fix Update

Issued: 2017-07-11

OpenShift Container Platform release 3.5.5.31 is now available. The packages and bug fixes
included in the update are documented in the
[RHBA-2017:1640](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2017%3A1640) advisory.
The container images included in the update are documented in the
[RHBA-2017:1646](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2017%3A1646) advisory.

Space precluded documenting all of the bug fixes for this release in the
advisory. See the following sections for notes on upgrading and details on the
bug fixes included in this release.

#### Upgrading

To upgrade an existing OpenShift Container Platform 3.4 or 3.5 cluster to this latest release, use the
automated upgrade playbook. See
[Performing Automated In-place Cluster Upgrades](../install_config/upgrading/automated_upgrades.html#running-the-upgrade-playbook-directly) for instructions.

#### Bug Fixes

* When doing an incremental build, the S2I builder pulls its builder image before calling the ***save-artifacts*** script and does not ensure that the builder image is still there when it calls ***assemble***. This leaves a gap of time between the start of the build and the calling of the ***assemble*** script in which the image can be removed. If the image is removed, the build fails. This bug fix adds a call to ensure that the builder image exists right before calling the ***assemble*** script. As a result, the chance of the ***assemble*** script running and not finding an available builder image is greatly reduced. ([**BZ#1464537**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1464537))
* The Elasticsearch (ES) default value for sharing storage between ES instances was wrong. The incorrect default value allowed an ES pod starting up (when another ES pod was shutting down, e.g., during deployment configuration redeployments) to create a new location on the persistent volume (PV) for managing the storage volume. This duplicated data, and in some instances, potentially caused data loss. With this bug fix, all ES pods now run with `node.max_local_storage_nodes` set to `1`. As a result, the ES pods starting up or shutting down will no longer share the same storage, preventing data duplication and data loss. ([**BZ#1463046**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1463046))
* The version of Netty that is part of Cassandra 3.0.9 had a memory leak. This bug fix updates Cassandra to 3.0.13, which has a version of Netty that has a fix for the memory leak. ([**BZ#1457501**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1457501))
* VNID allow rules were being incorrectly removed before they were actually no longer in use. When containers had startup errors, it could cause the tracking to get out of sync. The rules that allowed communication for a namespace were removed too early, so that if there were still pods in that namespace on the node, they could not communicate with one another. This bug fix changes the way that the tracking is done to avoid edge cases around pod creation and deletion failures. As a result, the VNID tracking no longer fails, allowing traffic to flow. ([**BZ#1462338**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1462338))
* When an IP address was re-used, it would be generated with a random MAC address that would be different from the previous one. Any node with an ARP cache that still held the old entry for the IP would not be able to communicate with the node. This bug fix generates the MAC address deterministically from the IP address. As a result, a re-used IP address will always have the same MAC address, so the ARP cache no longer gets out of sync, allowing traffic to flow. ([**BZ#1462955**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1462955))
* Due to a coding error, `Pop()` operations could panic and cause the router to stop. This bug fix updates this logic and as a result panics no longer occur. ([**BZ#1464563**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1464563))
* When master controller routines watch for persistent volume Recycle success events, they may never receive one, but still keep trying indefinitely. This caused the potential for high CPU usage by the master controller as it leaks routines. This bug fix updates the routines to stop watching for these Recycle success events when they will never be received. As a result, the chance of high CPU usage by the master controller is reduced. ([**BZ#1460289**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1460289))

the advisories. See the following sections for notes on upgrading and details on
the bug fixes and images included in this release.

#### Bug Fixes

##### Image Registry

* The size of cached layers was previously uncounted, causing an image’s layer size for cached layers to be zero. This bug fix ensures cached layers are now properly counted, and as a result images now have the proper layer sizes. ([**BZ#1457043**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1457043))
* The OpenShift Container Registry used to append the forwarded target port to redirected location URLs. The registry client would get confused by the received location containing a superfluous port, and could not match it against the original host. This happened when exposed with TLS-termination other than passthrough. The client’s new request to the target location lacked credentials, and as a consequence, the image push failed due to authorization error. This bug fix rebases the registry to a newer version, which fixes forwarding processing logic. As a result, the registry no longer confuses its clients; clients can push images successfully to the exposed registry using arbitrary TLS-termination. ([**BZ#1489039**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1489039))
* Images younger than the threshold were not added to the dependency graph. Blobs used by a young image and by a prunable image were deleted because they had no references in the graph. This bug fix adds young images to the graph and marks them as non-prunable. As a result, blobs now have references and are not deleted. ([**BZ#1498123**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1498123))
* Neither documentation nor CLI help talked about insecure connections to the secured registry. Errors used to be hard to decipher when users attempted to prune the secured registry with a bad CA certificate. This bug fix ensures that errors are now printed with hints, CLI help has been updated, and new flags have been provided to allow for insecure fallback. As a result, users can now easily enforce both secure and insecure connections and understand any HTTPS errors and how to resolve them. ([**BZ#1474446**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1474446))
##### Logging

* Messages were previously read into Fluentd’s memory buffer and were lost if the pod was restarted. Because Fluentd considers them read even though they have not been pushed to storage, any message not stored but already read by Fluentd was lost. This bug fix replaces the memory buffer with a file-based buffer. As a result, file-buffered messages are pushed to storage once Fluentd restarts. ([**BZ#1477515**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1477515))
* The pattern for container logs in the journal field `CONTAINER_NAME` changed. The pattern was not matching for logs from pods in the `default`, `openshift`, or `openshift-infra` namespaces. Logs from these namespaces were being stored in indices matching `project.default.*`, for example rather than `.operations.*`. This bug fix updates the pattern matcher to match the correct pattern. As a result, logs from pods in the affected namespaces are correctly written to the `.operations.*` indices. ([**BZ#1494310**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1494310))
* Memory was not being set properly for the Kibana container. This bug fix uses underscores instead of dashes, and memory settings are now honored by the Node.js runtime. ([**BZ#1469711**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1469711))
* When moving to use the journald log driver instead of the json-file log driver, the code that parses the journald Kubernetes records was not preserving the `message` field created by the Kubernetes meta filter plug-in. This caused the raw JSON message to be put back into the `message` field. This bug fix preserves the `message` field created when the Kubernetes meta filter parses the JSON blob. As a result, the parsed `message` field is preserved. ([**BZ#1439504**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1439504))
##### Web Console

* Previously, the web console Overview page would not finish loading if a resource name contained only digits, for example a deployment configuration "54321". This bug fix updates the web console, and the Overview page now works as expected for any valid resource name. ([**BZ#1485892**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1485892))
##### Master

* In some failure cases, the etcd client used by OpenShift will not rotate through all the available etcd cluster members. The client will end up repeatedly trying the same server. If that server is down, then requests will fail for an extended time until the client finds the server invalid. If the etcd leader goes away when it is attempted to be contacted for something like authentication, then the authentication fails and the etcd client is stuck trying to communicate with the etcd member that does not exist. User authentication would fail for an extended period of time. With this bug fix, the etcd client now rotates to other cluster members even on failure. If the etcd leader goes away, the worst that should happen is a failure of that one authentication attempt. The next attempt will succeed because a different etcd member will be used. ([**BZ#1490428**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1490428))
* The upstream discovery was not set to prefer version v1. It preferred the API group version instead. The old `oc` client was able to get discovery information when talking to the newer server and prefer the grouped API version of the resource. However, the version was not recognized. With this bug fix, the upstream directory is now set to prefer version v1. ([**BZ#1463576**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1463576))
##### Networking

* Conntrack entries for UDP traffic were not cleared when an endpoint was added for a service that previously had no endpoints. The system could end up incorrectly caching a rule that would cause traffic to that service to be dropped rather than being sent to the new endpoint. With this bug fix, the relevant conntrack entries are now deleted at the right time and UDP services work correctly when endpoints are added and removed. ([**BZ#1497768**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1497768))
##### Pod

* When describing multiple instances on AWS, each node is supplied as a filter. This fails to work if the cluster is large enough because AWS only allows up to 200 filters to a request. As a result, `DescribeInstances` calls fail, resulting in broken load balancer and storage functionality in AWS. This bug fix implements batching of describeinstance calls to get over the filtering limit. `DescribeInstances` calls now also work for larger clusters. ([**BZ#1460388**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1460388))
* Disabling the use of the proxy via `--disable-proxy` triggers a panic because the service stores have nil values. When disabling the proxy, the node will never start leaving the system in an indeterminate state. With this bug fix, the logic was reworked to ensure that the service stores are populated with non-nil values when the proxy is disabled. Using `--disable=proxy` no longer causes a panic and overall node start failure. ([**BZ#1484272**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1484272))
##### Storage

* When the `atomic-openshift-node` service was restarted, all processes in its control group were terminated, including the glusterfs mounted points. Each glusterfs volume in OpenShift corresponds to one mounted point. If all mounting points are lost, so are all of the volumes. This bug fix sets the control group mode to terminate only the main process and leave the remaining glusterfs mounting points untouched. When the `atomic-openshift-node` service is restarted, no glusterfs mounting point is terminated. ([**BZ#1472370**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1472370))

#### Bug Fixes

##### Authentication

* During upgrades, reconciliation happens only for cluster roles automatically,
  but this role needs to be adjusted in 3.6 due to enablement of API groups in
  this release. The Ansible upgrade code has been changed to address this role
  upgrade.
  ([**BZ#1493213**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1493213))
##### Image Registry

* The size of a cached layer did not get counted. Therefore, the layer size for
  cached layers was zero. Counting the size for cached layers now allows images to
  have proper layer sizes.
  ([**BZ#1457042**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1457042))
##### Logging

* `openshift-elasticsearch-plugin` was creating ACL roles based on the provided
  name, which could include slashes and commas. This caused the dependent library
  to not properly evaluate roles. With this bug fix, hash the name when creating
  ACL roles so they no longer contain the invalid characters.
  ([**BZ#1494239**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1494239))
* If the logging system is under a heavy load, it may take longer than the
  five-second timeout for Elasticsearch to respond, or it may respond with an
  error indicating that Fluentd needs to back off. In the former case, Fluentd
  will retry to send the records again, which can lead to having duplicate
  records. In the latter case, if Fluentd is unable to retry, it will drop
  records, leading to data loss. For the former case, the fix is to set the
  `request_timeout` to 10 minutes, so that Fluentd will wait up to 10 minutes for
  the reply from Elasticsearch before retrying the request. In the latter case,
  Fluentd will block attempting to read more input, until the output queues and
  buffers have enough room to write more data. This bug fix greatly reduces
  chances of duplicate data (though it is not entirely eliminated). Also, there is
  no data loss due to back pressure.
  ([**BZ#1497836**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1497836),
  [**BZ#1501948**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1501948),
  [**BZ#1506854**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1506854))
##### Management Console

* The management console was defaulting to the legacy API group `extensions` for
  jobs. As a result, the legacy API group appeared in the UI in places such as
  **Edit YAML**. With this bug fix, the console snow uses the new `batch` API group
  as the default for job resources. The API group and version on a job resource
  now appear as `batch/v1` wherever it is visible in the console.
  ([**BZ#1506233**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1506233))
##### Metrics

* Extra, unnecessary queries were being performed on each request. The GET
  `/hawkular/metrics/metrics` endpoint could fail with timeouts. With this bug
  fix, the extra queries are only performed when explicitly requested. By default,
  do not execute the extra queries that provide optional data. The endpoint is now
  more stable and not as susceptible to timeouts.
  ([**BZ#1458186**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1458186))
* When either a certificate within the chain at `serviceaccount/ca.crt` or any of
  the certificates within the provided truststore file contained a white space
  after the `BEGIN CERTIFICATE` declaration, the Java keytool rejected the
  certificate with an error, causing Origin Metrics to fail to start. As a
  workaround, Origin Metrics will now attempt to remove the spaces before feeding
  the certificate to the Keytool, but administrators should ensure their
  certificates do not contain such spaces.
  ([**BZ#1471251**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1471251),
  [**BZ#1500464**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1500464),
  [**BZ#1500471**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1500471))
##### Networking

* A slow image pull made the network diagnostics fail. With this bug fix, the
  timeout for the image pull was increased. The diagnostics now run in slow
  environments.
  ([**BZ#1481550**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1481550))
* The OpenShift node proxy previously did not support using a specified IP
  address. This could prevent correct operation on hosts with multiple network
  interface cards. The OpenShift node process already accepts a
  `--bind-address=<ip address>:<port>` command-line flag and `bindAddress:`
  configuration file option for the multiple network interface card case. The
  proxy functionality has been fixed to respect these options. When
  `--bind-address` or `bindAddress` are used, the OpenShift node proxy should work
  correctly when the OpenShift node host has multiple network interface cards.
  ([**BZ#1489023**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1489023),
  [**BZ#1489024**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1489024))
* Iptables called too often and unnecessarily. Therefore, time-outs would wait for
  iptables operations to finish. This bug fix changes the code so that it skips
  reloads when the iptables rules are unchanged. There are now fewer calls to
  iptables and, therefore, less time-outs.
  ([**BZ#1501517**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1501517))
##### Pod

* There was a symbolic link error for the log file of every pod started when the
  docker log driver was journald. Log symlink creation that fails when using
  journald logging driver was skipped. This bug fix resolves the issue.
  ([**BZ#1434942**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1434942))
* Currently, pod anti-affinity is respected across projects. Pod A from Project 1
  will not land on node where Pod B from Project 2 is running, if pod
  anti-affinity is enabled when scheduling Pod A. While scheduling Pod A, check
  for pod anti-affinity only within the project of Pod A. Pod anti-affinity will
  not be respected across projects.
  ([**BZ#1492194**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1492194))
##### Storage

* The volumePath that included the datastore name was parsed incorrectly. The same
  applies to volumePath that included datacluster and datastore names. It is not
  possible to attach persistent volumes that have the above described volumePath
  values. volumePath is now parsed correctly. Persistent volumes that have the
  above described volumePath values are attached
  correctly. ([**BZ#1497042**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1497042))
##### Security

* An attacker with knowledge of the given name used to authenticate and access
  Elasticsearch can later access it without the token, bypassing authentication.
  This attack also requires that the Elasticsearch be configured with an external
  route, and the data accessed is limited to the indices.
  ([**BZ#1501986**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1501986))

openshift3/ose:v3.5.5.31.48-2
```

#### Bug Fixes

* Custom **openshift-ansible** modules were not being loaded due to a missing dependency configuration. The issue was first identified when using Ansible 2.4.1, which included a change in how tasks and roles were dynamically included at runtime. ([**BZ#1516469**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1516469))
* Previously, the registry CA, certificate, and key were not updated when running the certificate redeploy playbooks. This bug fix updates the playbooks to ensure that these are all updated whenever new certificates are deployed, ensuring that pushes to the registry work as expected. ([**BZ#1383965**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1383965))
* When using `openshift_metrics_heapster_standalone=true` in an inventory file, the CA certificate was not generated, causing playbooks to fail. This bug fix allows the CA certificate to be generated when `openshift_metrics_heapster_standalone=true` is set as well. ([**BZ#1443741**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1443741))
* Previously, replacement of router certificates through use of the certificate redeployment playbook (***redeploy-certificates.yml***) or the router certificate redeployment playbook (***redeploy-router-certificates.yml***) would fail when a custom router certificate was provided. With this bug fix, custom router certificates set by `openshift_hosted_router_certificate` in inventory files now be redeployed. ([**BZ#1446737**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1446737))
* In some mixed-node environments, it was possible that host facts were not collected for containerized hosts, causing a conditional to fail. This bug fix adds a conditional to allow the check to complete correctly. ([**BZ#1462517**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1462517))
* Invalid PEM data could be left in the route configuration file during extended validation, causing the router to crash. This bug fix sanitizes PEM data from route configuration, and as a result extended validations now properly catch malformed certificates. ([**BZ#1511732**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1511732))
* The configuration management for `BuildDefaults` attempted to remove environment variables that were previously defined, but have since been removed from the configuration. In situations where no environment variables have been configured, this was failing because the `env` key did not exist. This bug fix updates the process to skip the cleanup when the `env` key does not exist. ([**BZ#1515459**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1515459))

#### Enhancements

* When installing logging, the master configuration is now updated to add the `loggingPublicURL` parameter. Without `loggingPublicURL` being set, a user would not see a link to view historical logs from the web console. With this enhancement, the `loggingPublicURL` and its value is now added to the master configuration when installing logging and restarted so that when logging into the web console users can see the link to view historical logs. ([**BZ#1414706**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1414706))

### RHBA-2018:1106 - OpenShift Container Platform 3.5.5.31.66 Bug Fix Update

Issued: 2018-04-12

OpenShift Container Platform release 3.5.5.31.66 is now available. The list of packages
included in the update are documented in the
[RHBA-2018:1106](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2018%3A1106) advisory.

Space precluded documenting all of the bug fixes for this release in the
advisories. See the following sections for notes on upgrading and details on the
bug fixes included in this release.

#### Bug Fixes

##### Command Line Interface

* When the master configuration specifies a default `nodeSelector` for the
  cluster, test projects created by `oadm diagnostics NetworkCheck` got this
  `nodeSelector`, and therefore the test pods were also confined to this
  `nodeSelector`. This caused `NetworkCheck` test pods to only be scheduled on a
  subset of nodes, preventing the diagnostic covering the entire cluster; in some
  clusters, this might even result in too few pods running for the diagnostic to
  succeed even if the cluster health is fine. With this bug fix, `NetworkCheck`
  now creates the test projects with an empty `nodeSelector` so they can land on
  any schedulable node. As a result, the diagnostic should be more robust and
  meaningful.
  ([**BZ#1534775**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1534775))
##### Installer

* OpenShift Container Platform requires that host names conform to standards which preclude the
  use of uppercase letters. With this bug fix, the installer now ensures that the
  host names for node objects are created with lowercase letters.
  ([**BZ#1543748**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1543748))
##### Logging

* Fluentd was adding the level field with a value of `3` or `6`, overwriting any
  existing level field. The level field set by the application was being removed,
  and the `3` or `6` value was not useful. With this bug fix, if there is already
  a `level` field in the record, then see if it is a "close" match to one of the
  canonical `level` field values. For example, if `level` is `CRITICAL`, convert
  to `crit`; if level is `WARN`, convert to `warning`. Otherwise, if it cannot be
  used directly or normalized, convert it to its string representation (ruby
  `to_s` method) and store the string value in the `level` field. As a result, if
  the record already has a level field, the value is normalized or preserved,
  otherwise, a value like `info` or `err` is used.
  ([**BZ#1514110**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1514110))
##### Web Console

* A common problem with Angular (the application framework) and some template
  logic caused certain kinds of template logic to cause instability while
  rendering, resulting in `$digest loop` errors. The template render loop reached
  its maximum number of cycles and stopped processing, resulting in broken
  templates on the pages using the **pods-table** component. This bug fix backports
  a fix from OpenShift Container Platform 3.6 to the **pods-table** component that eliminates the
  issue causing the `$digest` cycle to hit its maximum. As a result, the pages
  using the **pods-table** component should now function as normal (tested with 25+
  pod replicas).
  ([**BZ#1538431**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1538431))
* Use of JavaScript Array methods not supported by Internet Explorer 11
  (`Array.find`, `Array.findIndex`) prevented some A-MQ pages from showing content
  when the user clicks on a tree node. This bug fix replace the unsupported Array
  methods with the Lodash library, and as a result the A-MQ pages show their
  content as expected.
  ([**BZ#1543402**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1543402))

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# CVE-2018-1002105

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2018-1002104.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2018-1002161.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2018-1002105 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1002105)

#### Description

In all Kubernetes versions prior to v1.10.11, v1.11.5, and v1.12.3, incorrect handling of error responses to proxied upgrade requests in the kube-apiserver allowed specially crafted requests to establish a connection through the Kubernetes API server to backend servers, then send arbitrary requests over the same connection directly to the backend, authenticated with the Kubernetes API server's TLS credentials used to establish the backend connection.

## Description

[![@liggitt](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/980082?u=e6d3a90de563c894207290d21eb6987a1d45391a&v=4&size=48)](/liggitt)[liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt)opened [on Nov 26, 2018](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/71411#issue-384280279)

[CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) (9.8, critical)

With a specially crafted request, users that are authorized to establish a connection through the Kubernetes API server to a backend server can then send arbitrary requests over the same connection directly to that backend, authenticated with the Kubernetes API server’s TLS credentials used to establish the backend connection.

Thanks to Darren Shepherd for reporting this problem.

[CVE-2018-1002105](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-579h-mv94-g4gp "CVE-2018-1002105") is **fixed** in the following Kubernetes releases:

* [v1.10.11](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG-1.10.md/#v11011)
* [v1.11.5](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG-1.11.md/#v1115)
* [v1.12.3](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG-1.12.md/#v1123)
* [v1.13.0-rc.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG-1.13.md/#v1130-rc1)

### Affected components:

* Kubernetes API server

### Affected versions:

* Kubernetes v1.0.x-1.9.x
* Kubernetes v1.10.0-1.10.10 (fixed in [v1.10.11](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG-1.10.md/#v11011))
* Kubernetes v1.11.0-1.11.4 (fixed in [v1.11.5](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG-1.11.md/#v1115))
* Kubernetes v1.12.0-1.12.2 (fixed in [v1.12.3](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG-1.12.md/#v1123))

Note: If you are using binaries or packages provided by a distributor (not the ones provided in the open source release artifacts), you should contact them to determine what versions resolve this CVE. Distributors may choose to provide support for older releases beyond the ones maintained by the open source project.

### Affected configurations:

* Clusters >= 1.6.x that run aggregated API servers (like the metrics server) that are directly accessible from the Kubernetes API server’s network. If there are aggregated API servers configured in a cluster, the following command will return the names of the associated APIService objects (if no names are listed, or the kube-apiserver is an older version that does not have the apiservices API, then the cluster has no aggregated API servers configured):
  ```
  kubectl get apiservices \
    -o 'jsonpath={range .items[?(@.spec.service.name!="")]}{.metadata.name}{"\n"}{end}'

  ```
* Clusters >= 1.0.x that grant pod exec/attach/portforward permissions to users that are not expected to have full access to kubelet APIs

### Vulnerability impact:

* An API call to any aggregated API server endpoint can be escalated to perform any API request against that aggregated API server, as long as that aggregated API server is directly accessible from the Kubernetes API server’s network. **[Default RBAC policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#discovery-roles) allows all users (authenticated and unauthenticated) to perform discovery API calls that allow this escalation against any aggregated API servers configured in the cluster.**
* A pod exec/attach/portforward API call can be escalated to perform any API request against the kubelet API on the node specified in the pod spec (e.g. listing all pods on the node, running arbitrary commands inside those pods, and obtaining the command output). **Pod exec/attach/portforward permissions are included in the admin/edit RBAC roles intended for namespace-constrained users.**

### Mitigations:

This section lists possible mitigations to use prior to upgrading. Note that many of the mitigations are likely to be disruptive, and upgrading to a fixed version is strongly recommended.

#### Mitigations for the anonymous user -> aggregated API server escalation include:

* suspend use of aggregated API servers (note that this will disrupt users of the APIs provided by the aggregated server)
* disable anonymous requests by passing `--anonymous-auth=false` to the kube-apiserver (note that this may disrupt load balancer or kubelet health checks of the kube-apiserver, and breaks `kubeadm join` setup flows)
* remove *all* anonymous access to *all* aggregated APIs (including discovery permissions granted by the [default discovery role bindings](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#discovery-roles))

#### Mitigations for the authenticated user -> aggregated API server escalation include:

* suspend use of aggregated API servers (note that this will disrupt users of the APIs provided by the aggregated server)
* remove *all* access to *all* aggregated APIs (including discovery permissions granted by the [default discovery role bindings](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#discovery-roles)) from users that should not have full access to the aggregated APIs (note that this may disrupt users and controllers that make use of discovery information to map API types to URLs)

#### Mitigation for the authorized pod exec/attach/portforward -> kubelet API escalation:

* Remove pod exec/attach/portforward permissions from users that should not have full access to the kubelet API

### Detection:

There is no simple way to detect whether this vulnerability has been used. Because the unauthorized requests are made over an established connection, they do not appear in the Kubernetes API server audit logs or server log. The requests do appear in the kubelet or aggregated API server logs, but are indistinguishable from correctly authorized and proxied requests via the Kubernetes API server.

  + [Demo](#demo-1)
  + [Usage](#usage-1)

## Authenticated PoC

Proof-of-Concept exploit for CVE-2018-1002105. The current exploit requires `create` and `get` privileges on `pods` and `pods/exec`. Support has been added for `portforward` and `attach`, which require similar permissions.

The current PoC dumps the secrets from the default `etcd-kubernetes` pod.

### Demo

The PoC in action:

[![asciicast](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e6632b5e52edf7e14f1e034ad3dcfd98d155ffdbd33ad9898aed017de2081945/68747470733a2f2f61736369696e656d612e6f72672f612f6b756253726568416631344b374d5139615a773252704359642e737667)](https://asciinema.org/a/kubSrehAf14K7MQ9aZw2RpCYd)

### Usage

```
usage: poc.py [-h] --target TARGET --jwt TOKEN [--namespace NAMESPACE] --pod
              POD --method {exec,portforward,attach}
              [--privileged-namespace PNAMESPACE] [--privileged-pod PPOD]
              [--container CONTAINER] [--command COMMAND]
              [--filename FILENAME]

PoC for CVE-2018-1002105.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

required arguments:
  --target TARGET, -t TARGET
                        API server target:port
  --jwt TOKEN, -j TOKEN
                        JWT token for service account
  --namespace NAMESPACE, -n NAMESPACE
                        Namespace with method access
  --pod POD, -p POD     Pod with method access
  --method {exec,portforward,attach}, -m {exec,portforward,attach}

optional arguments:
  --privileged-namespace PNAMESPACE, -s PNAMESPACE
                        Target namespace
  --privileged-pod PPOD, -e PPOD
                        Target privileged pod
  --container CONTAINER, -c CONTAINER
                        Target container
  --command COMMAND, -x COMMAND
                        Command to execute
  --filename FILENAME, -f FILENAME
                        File to save output to

```

Example:

```
$ ./poc.py -t 10.0.2.15:6443 --jwt [token] -p [pod] -f etcd.out -m attach
[*] Building pipe using attach...
[+] Pipe opened :D
[*] Attempting code exec on etcd-kubernetes/etcd
[*] Writing output to etcd.out ....
[+] Done!
```

Check for tokens:

```
$ grep -air eyJ etcd.db
```

## Unauthenticated PoC

The unauthenticated PoC allows privilege escalation within the context of the exposed API. Depending on the functionalities of the API it might be possible to get code execution on pods. This demo currently exploits the bug to gain cluster-admin rights on the `servicecatalog.k8s.io` API. This exploit should also work for `metrics.k8s.io` or any API exposed through the aggregated layer.

### Demo

The PoC in action:

CVE-2018-1002105
Security Release Post Mortem

Impact

● An API call to any aggregated API server endpoint can be escalated to perform any API

request against that aggregated API server. In default configurations, all users
(authenticated and unauthenticated) are allowed to perform discovery API calls that
allow this escalation.

● A pod exec/attach/portforward API call can be escalated to perform any API request

against the kubelet API on the node specified in the pod spec (e.g. listing all pods on the
node, running arbitrary commands inside those pods, and obtaining the command
output). Pod exec/attach/portforward permissions are included in the admin/edit/view
RBAC roles intended for namespace-constrained users.

2018-12-03 9:00AM Security announcement published

, details added to

CVE issue

Root Causes and Trigger

● Existing proxy components were reused for new use-cases as the Kubernetes API
server evolved, without verifying the security-related aspects functioned properly

● Error-handling paths for those proxy components were not fully tested
● Kubernetes API server proxy components still use http/1.1 upgrade-based connection
tunneling, which does not distinguish between request data sent by the apiserver while
establishing the backend connection, and data sent by the requesting user

● High and low-privilege API requests to aggregated API servers are proxied via the same

component with the same high-permission transport credentials

Lessons Learned

What worked

● Private review cycle went smoothly
● Feedback on timeline for distributors to update was positive
● Canonical release plan doc worked well for release coordination
● Embargo was maintained

What can go better

● Some confusion around the Availability metric of the

CVSS

 (availability severity was

based on the ability of an attacker to disrupt workloads, affecting availability)

● No ability to cut patch releases without making source public via PRs
● CI in private repo had atrophied, made getting CI signal difficult
● Patch managers’ time zones made cutting releases during North America business

hours cut into their evenings

● Confusion about impact from users

○ Questions about vulnerable versions from distributors (non-OSS builds)
○ Two known escalation paths (one typically exploitable by anonymous requests,
one typically not) confused users trying to determine if their clusters were
vulnerable

● Distributor handling of embargoed information was unclear

○ “Non-embargoed patch, embargoed security implications” was confusing
○ Include security team, fix team, release team in review of the distributor

pre-disclosure prior to sending it

■ Help catch any technical issues
■ Help point out questions about what is allowed with the embargoed data

○ Pre-disclosure announcement needed more explicit “you may do X” and “you

may not do X” statements

■ Distributors that ship binaries weren’t sure if they could ship prior to

disclosure (because the patch wasn’t under embargo)

​
​
​
​
■ Distributors that host solutions weren’t sure if they could upgrade hosted

environments prior to disclosure

■ Is there a channel for distributors to ask for clarification of embargo

handling for a specific issue?
○ Coordination between distributors was difficult

■ How do distributors know who has access to the embargoed information?
■ Membership of the distributors list is not visible
■ Is there a channel for discussion between members of the distributors list
■ Multiple distributors re-implemented proof of concept exploit code (or at

least a programmatic test that shows the patch was effective). Should we
target including a test like that in the pre-disclosure?
■ The old (non-kubernetes.io) mailing lists are confusing

● Announcement friction

○ Security process refers to
deprecated in favor of
announcement email bounced

kubernetes-users@googlegroups.com

 which was

https://discuss.kubernetes.io

, found out when the

○ Posting announcement to

https://discuss.kubernetes.io
(need to make sure all PST members responsible for posting are approved for all
channels)

 was held for moderation

○ Last-minute coordination was required to post to slack #announcements channel

Where we got lucky

● Security issue was reported privately
● Timeline for disclosure made it in prior to 1.13.0 so it could be included in release

announcements

● Realized the potential for exploit before handling publicly

Where we got unlucky

● Bug was discussed (without security implications) months earlier in

https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/14931

● Since there was no other content since 1.10.10 and its release announcement was
exactly in line with the 1.11 and 1.12 release Nov. 26, but its changelog was solely
"Fixes an issue with stuck connections handling error responses (#71415, @liggitt)" this
shines a light such that trivial source analysis of the only fix in 1.10.11 could have led to
folks realizing there was a severe CVE in flight a whole week ahead of the embargo.

## Synopsis

Critical: OpenShift Container Platform 3.6 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A3598)

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release 3.6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Critical. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

OpenShift Enterprise by Red Hat is the company's cloud computing Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution designed for on-premise or private cloud deployments.

Security Fix(es):

* A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in OpenShift Container Platform 3.x which allows for compromise of pods running on a compute node to which a pod is scheduled with normal user privilege. This access could include access to all secrets, pods, environment variables, running pod/container processes, and persistent volumes, including in privileged containers. Additionally, on versions 3.6 and higher of OpenShift Container Platform, this vulnerability allows cluster-admin level access to any API hosted by an aggregated API server. This includes the ‘servicecatalog’ API which is installed by default in 3.7 and later. Cluster-admin level access to the service catalog allows creation of brokered services by an unauthenticated user with escalated privileges in any namespace and on any node. This could lead to an attacker being allowed to deploy malicious code, or alter existing services. (CVE-2018-1002105)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

=== Content from youtu.be_3f47f3db_20250126_063134.html ===
[00:02] all right this is the postmortem
[00:05] call on December 20th 2018 for CBE 2018
[00:11] one zero zero two one zero five on the
[00:16] call our participants from Sigma and
[00:20] Sigma the API machinery and from the
[00:23] security group for kubernetes this
[00:30] document that we're going to be
[00:31] reviewing has already been constructed
[00:35] and reviewed by the people who
[00:38] participated in the incident and those
[00:45] gonna be gonna be reviewing the document
[00:48] muttering questions read questions feel
[00:51] free to add them to the doc or call them
[00:54] out on the call and we can discuss them
[00:55] and then after this call
[00:58] we'll be publishing publishing this
[01:01] document as a PDF links to from the
[01:03] website somewhere all right so I'm going
[01:08] to just start reviewing this and feel
[01:10] free to interrupt with questions and
[01:12] we'll go from there so just to summarize
[01:17] what the issue was there was a
[01:21] vulnerability that allowed TCP
[01:23] connection reuse for
[01:26] connections that were proxied through
[01:28] the API server to back-end servers and
[01:31] the to escalation paths that were known
[01:35] were through the API server to
[01:37] aggregated api's and then through the
[01:40] API server to cubelets
[01:42] in particular calls through the accuser
[01:47] her to aggregated API servers could be
[01:50] exercised
[01:51] via discovery api's that were by default
[01:55] permitted to anonymous users the
[01:59] escalation path to the cubelet was via
[02:03] the pod exec attachment port forward
[02:05] api's and those are not permitted to
[02:11] anonymous users by default so that
[02:14] typically would be a low privilege to
[02:18] hike Riblet escalation there's a link to
[02:22] the github issue that really dives into
[02:25] a lot of the details about which
[02:27] particular versions were affected which
[02:29] particular configurations so if you're
[02:31] interested feel free to follow that link
[02:34] and find out more but hopefully most
[02:37] people are familiar with that by now
[02:40] jumping down to the timeline for the
[02:43] incident the bug was first reported
[02:47] publicly against the rancher component
[02:50] actually they made use of the API server
[02:55] and some users noticed that when load
[03:00] balancers would speak to the API server
[03:02] this TCP connection reuse vulnerability
[03:06] would actually manifest as a bug we're
[03:08] connected we get stuck open and the load
[03:10] balancer would reuse it and then get
[03:12] error error responses that didn't make
[03:15] any sense so it sat as a bug report for
[03:19] a few months while they were trying to
[03:21] figure out what was going on with it
[03:24] the beginning of November rancher devs
[03:28] actually root caused it and found the
[03:31] bug and reported it privately to the
[03:35] kubernetes project security team
[03:40] within a few hours the report was
[03:43] acknowledged by the next day a
[03:46] proof-of-concept exploit was produced
[03:49] and the next business day a fix was
[03:54] opened for review
[03:58] you
[04:00] the following day a second
[04:02] proof-of-concept exploit for the
[04:05] anonymous upgrade attack was produced
[04:07] and so that lengthened the review
[04:10] process to make sure that all of the all
[04:14] of the ways that this could be exploited
[04:16] were understood and that we knew what
[04:20] the severity was before we moved forward
[04:22] the following day the fix was the review
[04:28] was completed and CI tests in the
[04:31] Private Security repository were green
[04:34] with the fix so in to end integration
[04:37] and unit tests were passing at that
[04:40] point the communications for the pre
[04:44] disclosure were put together and
[04:46] reviewed and were sent out to the
[04:50] kubernetes distributors announce list on
[04:53] November 9th with these time frame
[04:59] releasing cutting releases containing
[05:02] the fix on November 26th and publicly
[05:07] disclosing the vulnerability on December
[05:10] 3rd
[05:15] happened to coincide with the release of
[05:18] 113 as well which was fortunate I guess
[05:26] so the issue was resolved in versions of
[05:33] 110 111 and 112 on November 26th and was
[05:40] also included in the 113 dotto release
[05:44] on December 3rd analysis of the root
[05:57] causes revealed that the proxy
[06:03] components the particular component that
[06:05] had the vulnerability had existed since
[06:07] kubernetes 100 and originally was used
[06:12] for pod exec and port forward and then
[06:16] later was used for additional proxy use
[06:19] cases specifically the aggregation when
[06:22] that was added in the 1 6 1 7 time frame
[06:27] those components the test cases were
[06:31] primarily focused on making sure that
[06:34] the function that they were used for
[06:36] worked correctly and so the tests were
[06:40] primarily positive tests not testing
[06:45] error conditions or negative tests
[06:52] another cause was that proxying in the
[06:57] kubernetes api server still uses HTTP
[07:00] one upgrade based connection tunneling
[07:03] rather than something like the HTTP 2
[07:08] proxying that means that when a request
[07:12] from an end-user is proxied through to a
[07:14] cubelet it drops down to a TCP
[07:16] connection and there's no distinction
[07:18] made between the requests that the API
[07:24] server made and subsequent
[07:27] Quest's from the user and finally the
[07:34] the method used to transfer
[07:38] authentication information from the API
[07:40] server to backends is secured via mutual
[07:43] TLS connection and both high and low
[07:50] privileged API requests are proxied in
[07:53] the same way which allowed a low
[07:55] privilege request like a discovery
[07:56] request via the discovery API once that
[08:01] dropped down to a TCP connection to be
[08:03] reused to make high privileged requests
[08:06] like mutating API requests so those were
[08:14] the those were the technical rip causes
[08:17] most of the most of the lessons learned
[08:22] were around the actual review and
[08:25] release process and so I wanted to jump
[08:27] down to some of the action items that
[08:29] came out of the technical root causes
[08:31] before we go through some of the
[08:35] existing feedback so some of the issues
[08:40] that have been opened either to
[08:42] investigate changes or to lock down
[08:46] existing behavior there is an old issue
[08:51] for switching away from speedy proxying
[08:56] and systems specifically to http 2 but
[08:59] it is also being used to look at
[09:04] switching from HTTP one upgrade proxying
[09:07] to HTTP 2 tunneling another item is to
[09:14] lock down the upgrade protocols that we
[09:16] allow to the ones that we expect so
[09:19] specifically use maybe in WebSockets a
[09:23] lot of these are kind of been done in
[09:25] parallel if we switch these HTTP two
[09:29] that would remove the need for locking
[09:32] down the upgrade protocols but something
[09:35] like HTTP 2 switch is likely to take
[09:37] longer because of deprecation policies
[09:40] and maintaining api compatibility and so
[09:43] we're looking for ways to reduce our
[09:46] surface area in the meantime
[09:52] straightforward things like adding tests
[09:54] of air conditions for proxy components
[09:56] this was actually done as part of
[09:58] developing the fix for the CDE and was
[10:03] opened there are a couple of issues
[10:20] opened to track improving how the
[10:23] aggregation of discovery apos
[10:25] works one to sort of air gap discovery
[10:30] requests so that requests to the
[10:32] aggregator are not played to the
[10:35] back-end servers but rather the
[10:37] aggregator does discovery doc fetching
[10:40] and then serves those from cache another
[10:45] possible change would be to place
[10:51] limitations on which requests are even
[10:54] allowed to serve upgrade requests so
[10:57] because the aggregator has knowledge
[11:00] about the structure of the API it can
[11:02] potentially make decisions about
[11:06] bridgework which requests would even
[11:08] allow upgrade if they follow known api
[11:10] path patterns
[11:19] there is a security audit that is
[11:22] currently in the proposal stage and will
[11:25] be performed early next year and so one
[11:29] of the follow-up items from this was to
[11:31] identify specific components like this
[11:34] proxy component and specific scenarios
[11:38] like proxying through the API server to
[11:41] aggregated servers or to cubelet that we
[11:44] want scrutiny on during that security
[11:47] audit and so I'm I'm taking the action
[11:50] item to coordinate with the security
[11:54] security audit workgroup to make sure
[11:56] that the list of components and the
[11:59] areas of the code that we want to be
[12:01] scrutinized are make it into that
[12:04] process
[12:10] in addition to specifically testing air
[12:13] conditions fuzz testing could possibly
[12:17] have helped catch some of these things
[12:20] like I mentioned this was originally
[12:22] reported as a bug that was encountered
[12:25] in the wild and so it was possible to
[12:29] trigger with act and with accidental
[12:32] requests and so fuzz testing that would
[12:37] have triggered an air condition in the
[12:39] back end could possibly have detected
[12:42] that it wasn't being handled correctly
[12:51] in the interest of
[12:54] the attack surface available to
[12:56] unauthenticated requests there's an
[13:00] issue open to investigating narrowing
[13:03] which endpoints are allowed to anonymous
[13:06] users currently unauthenticated requests
[13:11] are allowed to obtain health information
[13:15] which is basically an up or down signal
[13:18] at the API server is healthy
[13:20] version information and discovery
[13:22] information health and version are
[13:26] likely to continue to be allowed because
[13:29] those are frequently used by load
[13:31] balancers that don't have the ability to
[13:32] authenticate but those are much better
[13:37] understood api's they don't involve
[13:42] boxing to other servers they don't have
[13:45] complex handlers and so that issue some
[13:50] two one one five is open to track
[13:52] investigating removing discovery
[13:55] permissions from anonymous users by
[13:57] default
[14:03] seven two one one six
[14:05] tract investigation of adding binding
[14:09] requests finding information so that
[14:11] when the API server acting as an
[14:15] authenticating proxy for words or
[14:17] requests to the backend it could add
[14:20] information into the request to indicate
[14:24] what
[14:27] particular URL it was intending to
[14:30] forward to so that in addition to the
[14:35] channel secured request the the in TLS
[14:41] secured request it would be something
[14:42] particular to the request in the headers
[14:45] that would let the backend verify that
[14:48] this particular request was
[14:50] intentionally forward
[14:52] you
[14:54] seven two one one seven is open to
[14:57] investigate alternatives to practicing
[15:01] through the API server for things like
[15:02] pod exec this has long been discussed
[15:07] and there is interest in it it is
[15:11] unclear
[15:15] whether the security posture would be
[15:17] improved just by splitting out the
[15:21] proxying to a different component if
[15:22] that component was required to have the
[15:25] same level of authority to the backend
[15:28] but if you are interested in that or
[15:30] have ideas around that that is an issue
[15:34] to follow and comment on
[15:38] alright that is the end of the technical
[15:43] action items the remaining ones are
[15:47] around communication and the release
[15:52] process itself and so I'm going to jump
[15:54] back up to the lessons learned section I
[16:00] do want to pause there just if there are
[16:04] questions about any of those action
[16:06] items or other other points that people
[16:10] wanted to raise on the technical side
[16:11] before we continue
[16:15] you
[16:21] I had a extra private or public I'm
[16:26] sorry can you repeat that how to export
[16:30] private or public there exploit
[16:35] now yes are they pubic or primate the
[16:39] proof of concept exploits have not been
[16:41] released
[16:42] I've seen a couple that have been
[16:47] produced by third parties but the
[16:51] product security team has not released
[16:53] our proof of concept exploits
[16:58] okay thanks mm-hmm all right if you have
[17:05] other questions or would like to follow
[17:07] any of these issues or comment on them
[17:10] please do so in in the issues I'd be
[17:14] great all right jumping back up to kind
[17:19] of the feedback on the actual review and
[17:22] release cycles so things that went well
[17:28] the private review and testing win
[17:32] smoothly that's good that hasn't always
[17:34] been the case
[17:37] the timeline that was provided to
[17:43] distributors to test and release the fix
[17:48] within their distributions feedback was
[17:50] that the timeline was reasonable it was
[17:53] particularly tricky just given the time
[17:55] of year and that holiday freezes and
[17:59] Black Friday and things like that were
[18:03] in play and so trying to navigate those
[18:06] in addition to getting the fix out as
[18:09] quickly as we could and making sure it
[18:11] made it into one thirteen as well those
[18:14] were kind of the things we were trying
[18:15] to balance but the feedback was that the
[18:18] timeline ended up being fairly
[18:20] reasonable coordination between the
[18:24] security release team the product
[18:27] security team and the release managers
[18:29] went well we used a sort of a single
[18:32] canonical release plan dock to
[18:34] coordinate that make sure everyone
[18:36] understood what was happening on what
[18:37] day that that went well this time and
[18:41] then finally the embargo on the pre
[18:44] disclosure during the two weeks when it
[18:46] was disclosed to distributors before the
[18:49] public releases were cut embargo was
[18:51] maintained which is appreciated and and
[18:55] gives us confidence that we can continue
[19:00] to make fixes and coordinate with the
[19:01] distributors and get good information
[19:04] out into the public responsibly
[19:10] all right so some things that we got
[19:13] feedback on that could have gone better
[19:15] not all of this was publicly visible but
[19:18] the initial announcement to distributors
[19:21] had a cbss score that was high it was
[19:27] still critical but it didn't consider
[19:32] the ability to impact workloads
[19:35] availability via this vulnerability and
[19:37] so we had a follow-up that increased
[19:40] that score to the one that is in the
[19:43] public issue now we're still trying to
[19:47] figure out how to map some of the
[19:49] metrics for these vulnerabilities to the
[19:53] cbss score given that different
[19:56] configurations might be differently
[19:59] affected the public releases were still
[20:06] cut publicly so on the 26th the fix that
[20:12] had been tested and reviewed and given
[20:16] to distributors was opened into the
[20:18] public repo and then there was a time
[20:22] delay of several hours while that merged
[20:25] and see I ran and build artifacts were
[20:29] produced and rpm and Debian packages
[20:32] were built and pushed we would still
[20:35] like to shorten the window from when a
[20:39] fix is publicly visible to when they
[20:43] really started backs are available this
[20:49] was a minor issue but see I in the
[20:54] private repo continually atrophies and
[20:58] because we aren't continuously cutting
[21:01] security releases thank goodness it
[21:03] means that when we do jump into the
[21:06] private repo to do this it was usually
[21:08] ci fixes that need to be made so that
[21:12] delayed us about a day if you look at
[21:14] the timeline the review completed on the
[21:17] 6th and it took us until the 7th to get
[21:20] green CI
[21:21] I was trying to get that working again
[21:27] while we were cutting the releases the
[21:30] patch managers for the three releases
[21:32] are in drastically different time zones
[21:34] and so there was some coordination
[21:37] difficulty around making sure that we
[21:41] weren't making him stay up until
[21:43] midnight just to cut a release and so
[21:47] there was some handoff issues there that
[21:49] we worked through but required a little
[21:52] bit of scrambling at the last minute
[21:56] this was more public-facing if you look
[22:01] at the public issue seven one four one
[22:05] one and look at the number of times the
[22:08] the description of that was edited the
[22:10] initial announcement and text tried to
[22:15] lay out which versions and which
[22:19] configurations were impacted but a lot
[22:23] of questions kind of revealed that there
[22:25] was confusion about that and so
[22:30] part of this was because there were two
[22:31] escalation pads with two different
[22:34] permission levels that affected two
[22:37] different version ranges so the cube
[22:43] cubelet pod exec attached path affected
[22:48] all the way back to one oh the
[22:50] aggregated API server path affected back
[22:53] to I think one six or one seven and so
[22:57] because there were two escalation pads
[22:58] for two different version ranges with
[23:01] two different permission levels that
[23:02] just led to a fair amount of confusion
[23:05] there are also questions about which
[23:08] versions were vulnerable for users that
[23:10] are using commercial distributions so
[23:14] not consuming the open source release
[23:17] artifacts but consuming something from a
[23:19] commercial vendor and so some of the
[23:23] follow-up items for that were to be sure
[23:26] that we include very concrete steps for
[23:31] determining if a cluster is vulnerable
[23:33] not necessarily proof of concept exploit
[23:37] but if you look at the what we ended up
[23:43] with in the description but we ended up
[23:49] with was a lot more specific than the
[23:50] original text so
[23:53] something like if you are at above this
[23:56] version and you have an aggregated API
[23:59] server and this command returns
[24:03] aggregated API services then you're
[24:06] vulnerable and so one of our follow-up
[24:09] items is to make sure that the text
[24:13] around affected configurations is very
[24:15] specific very concrete and whenever
[24:18] possible provides commands to run to
[24:23] diagnose whether a particular cluster is
[24:26] affected one of the slightly odd things
[24:34] about this particular incident was that
[24:36] the the bug had already been reported
[24:40] publicly but without reference to its
[24:43] security implications
[24:46] additionally the rancher developers once
[24:51] they figured out what the issue was had
[24:53] fixed the issue in a patch again without
[24:58] reference to the security implications
[24:59] and so we found ourselves in kind of the
[25:02] odd position of pre disclosing the
[25:06] security issue to distributors and
[25:09] giving them a patch that was essentially
[25:13] already available publicly elsewhere and
[25:17] so we couldn't in good conscience say
[25:21] that the patch was embargoed but the
[25:24] security implications of the patch were
[25:26] embargoed and so we got feedback that
[25:29] that was difficult to understand and
[25:32] some very security-conscious
[25:33] distributors
[25:37] probably you went overboard in how
[25:42] cautious they were to the point of not
[25:45] even giving their team's the patch that
[25:48] we had sent them because they didn't
[25:50] want to break embargo and so we we
[25:55] definitely heard the feedback that the
[25:56] communication with distributors needs to
[25:58] be very explicit very clear you may do
[26:03] this you may not do this you may produce
[26:06] builds you may not produce builds you
[26:08] may install those builds in hosted
[26:12] environments you may ship builds to
[26:14] end-users whatever is or is not allowed
[26:17] under the embargo needs to be very
[26:20] explicit and so we will be updating the
[26:24] announced templates that we use to send
[26:27] out pre disclosures to to be explicit
[26:30] about what may and may not be done prior
[26:32] to the embargoed lifting date another
[26:37] point of feedback was that coordination
[26:40] between distributors was difficult again
[26:43] people were being very conscientious
[26:46] which is greatly appreciated but in
[26:50] cases where there were two distributors
[26:52] that were both on the pre disclosure
[26:55] list and also have shared customers or
[27:00] installations it wasn't clear how they
[27:03] were supposed to coordinate on the issue
[27:06] while under embargo and so one of our
[27:10] action items is to make sure that there
[27:12] is a communication channel for
[27:14] distributors on the pre disclosure list
[27:17] to
[27:19] to coordinate prior to embargo lifting
[27:28] this last last bit is probably not
[27:32] interesting to anyone except the product
[27:34] security team but again things atrophy
[27:38] and since the last time we had a
[27:40] security release some of the channels
[27:43] that we announced things on had changed
[27:46] so the kubernetes users group got
[27:49] archived and the discuss forum got
[27:51] created and we didn't have posting
[27:53] permission to the right the right places
[27:56] in the forum or the announcement slack
[27:58] channel and so it's kind of inside
[28:02] baseball but making sure that the people
[28:03] who are supposed to send out
[28:04] announcements have permission to do so
[28:15] and if we jump down to the follow-up
[28:19] items some of the things around process
[28:22] that were wanting to take into
[28:26] consideration
[28:28] having multiple patch managers per
[28:30] release which is something the release
[28:32] team sig release had already plans to do
[28:34] for 114 which is great having having
[28:37] backups for that is great spreading
[28:40] those across time zones would be even
[28:42] better if possible and so that's being
[28:46] added to the things to consider when
[28:48] picking patch release managers some
[28:52] follow-up items to simplify and clarify
[28:55] how the distributors announce list is
[28:59] maintained there were some questions
[29:01] around which companies were on the
[29:03] distributor's announce list and so we
[29:07] have an action item to figure out how to
[29:09] publish membership of that list just for
[29:13] transparency and to demonstrate that the
[29:17] requirements the public requirements for
[29:19] being on that list are being followed
[29:21] and make it easier to to coordinate and
[29:24] inform people who want to know who has
[29:27] access to that information and then the
[29:32] the things that I mentioned about
[29:34] updating our templates to make sure that
[29:37] we are as specific and concrete as
[29:41] possible with the information we get
[29:42] people
[29:44] oh that covers both the technical and
[29:53] the process feedback and action items
[29:57] from this incident I will pause again
[30:03] and just ask if there are any other
[30:06] questions or pieces of feedback that
[30:09] people would like to consider
[30:20] so I have a question sure which is the
[30:25] like that like that sometimes things
[30:27] take a long time to realize there was
[30:29] security incident and I think that with
[30:32] kubernetes like anytime you have a
[30:33] platform that's open source that's an
[30:35] other people use and then they get bugs
[30:39] right there's always going to be this
[30:41] challenge and so I'm just curious
[30:44] whether there has been any thought to or
[30:46] maybe there already are structures for
[30:48] like kubernetes people in who are deeply
[30:52] involved in kubernetes somehow
[30:55] participating being on the lookout for
[30:57] bugs that are reported in the like a
[31:01] software that uses kubernetes that
[31:04] happens to be like you know be visible
[31:06] in some way or you don't I mean like
[31:08] some faster channel for not like I think
[31:14] if it was like not specifically forth
[31:16] security but for bugs in general that
[31:20] with some security people looking on
[31:22] there might be kind of a faster channel
[31:25] if that makes sense yeah that's an
[31:27] interesting question I I don't so if you
[31:32] look at our our dependencies we actually
[31:35] do monitor our dependencies for security
[31:38] vulnerabilities but kind of going the
[31:41] the other direction and saying oh this
[31:43] thing is built on top of kubernetes and
[31:48] encountered a bug that maybe look
[31:50] suspicious I I don't think there's any
[31:53] monitoring of that the volume that that
[31:57] would involve probably isn't tenable
[32:00] given the current number of people who
[32:02] are watching these issues of course I'm
[32:06] just thinking about it like you know in
[32:07] the parallel and you know if like if
[32:10] kubernetes and all of its all of the
[32:14] platforms that use it we're part of one
[32:17] company this type of thing would be
[32:19] flagged by support right support would
[32:21] go oh somebody reported about me
[32:23] actually maybe this is something that is
[32:25] you know actually belongs in a different
[32:27] component right and then those channels
[32:30] and
[32:31] discovering security things quicker
[32:34] right then then though it happens an
[32:38] open source and so if there are okay
[32:42] like I'm just wondering whether there
[32:43] are groups of people right who are more
[32:47] in the end user community aspect right
[32:51] who are thinking about just the the
[32:53] massive bugs that kubernetes like any
[32:56] firm has right and and and the users of
[33:00] that and if there are any pre-existing
[33:05] structures for corralling that feedback
[33:09] that we could insert some security
[33:11] experts into or some training and two or
[33:16] something so that the people who are
[33:19] maybe not specifically looking out for
[33:22] security might learn to spot this kind
[33:26] of thing yeah I think the two dimensions
[33:28] of that one is distributing across
[33:32] companies or products one of the goals
[33:37] actually of the distributors list is for
[33:40] it to become a two-way a two-way street
[33:43] where it's not just here's a way for the
[33:45] super just to find out about issues but
[33:48] it is increasing awareness of the
[33:52] security process and trying to get in
[33:54] place identified people for all of these
[33:57] different distributors and products that
[34:00] are thinking in terms of security issues
[34:03] and so as we add more companies and
[34:08] products to that list
[34:10] it helps us kind of get points of
[34:13] contact for those for those products and
[34:17] companies and build relationships where
[34:19] if they see something that's odd they
[34:21] they have a working relationship with us
[34:24] already and know how to go about getting
[34:29] that information to us the the other
[34:34] dimension
[34:35] I said there were two dimensions and now
[34:37] I've forgotten the second one I think
[34:39] the distributor list is the direct yeah
[34:42] ship with a company right and then I
[34:45] think the other dimension oh I remember
[34:47] one of one of the other the other
[34:50] dimension is across like the kubernetes
[34:53] product project not just in Zig off or
[34:57] this product security team we're looking
[35:00] at the process that changes to
[35:06] kubernetes goes through so the the kept
[35:09] process kubernetes enhancement proposal
[35:11] looking for specific questions and

[35:31] dimension is trying to improve it
[35:36] security being something that everyone
[35:38] in the project is aware of and cares
[35:39] about
[35:42] great yeah all right well if no one else
[35:57] wants to mention anything now

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A3754)

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release 3.3.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Critical. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is Red Hat's cloud computing Kubernetes application platform solution designed for on-premise or private cloud deployments.

Security Fix(es):

* A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in OpenShift Container Platform 3.x which allows for compromise of pods running on a compute node to which a pod is scheduled with normal user privilege. This access could include access to all secrets, pods, environment variables, running pod/container processes, and persistent volumes, including in privileged containers. Additionally, on versions 3.6 and higher of OpenShift Container Platform, this vulnerability allows cluster-admin level access to any API hosted by an aggregated API server. This includes the ‘servicecatalog’ API which is installed by default in 3.7 and later. Cluster-admin level access to the service catalog allows creation of brokered services by an unauthenticated user with escalated privileges in any namespace and on any node. This could lead to an attacker being allowed to deploy malicious code, or alter existing services. (CVE-2018-1002105)

This advisory contains the RPM packages for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.3. See the following advisory for the container images for this release:

[https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2018:3753](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2018%3A3753)

# Kubernetes Vulnerability: What You Can and Should Do to Protect Your Enterprise

Coalfire Cybersecurity Team

December 8, 2018

**This content is provided "as is" and is more than a year old. No representations are made that the content is up-to date or error-free. Please see the latest on this topic** [**here**](https://coalfire.com/services/security)**.**

## Vulnerability Summary

This week, news was released regarding a critical security Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) associated with the Kubernetes container software (CVE-2018-1002105). While this is only a reported vulnerability at this stage (and no actual exploits have been reported to date), organizations that have Kubernetes deployed within their environment(s) are strongly advised to treat this matter with high priority.

The nature of the vulnerability contained within CVE-2018-1002105 is related to [privilege escalation](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A5-Broken_Access_Control). Organizations running versions of Kubernetes containing the vulnerability may be susceptible to critical risks associated with **execution and detection** of unauthorized transactions committed via the Kubernetes Application Program Interface (API).

Depending on the organizationâs architecture, this vulnerability is the equivalent of leaving the front door open to the enterpriseâs entire cloud environment. The security risks are made even more challenging in that a compromise might not be detectable as it obfuscates the detection capabilities.

The goal of thisÂ blog is to provide general steps toward understanding your status with respect to this vulnerability and taking the appropriate defensive measures given your environment(s). There are concrete actions organizations can take to protect themselves from potential threats, such as downloading patches that have already been released, watching for patches that are yet to be released, and modifying architectural configuration for short-term risk mitigation.

The approach should follow a process similar to the following:

* Confirm whether your organization is affected by the Kubernetes vulnerability given your deployment version
* Evaluate risk factors to determine actual impacts of the vulnerability on your organizationâs environment(s)
* Weigh the tradeoffs that various patch and/or remediation approaches have on your environment to determine the appropriate path to follow

Please note, this blog aims to provide a general understanding of what risks organizations may face as a result of the Kubernetes CVE-2018-1002105, and high-level approaches that could be considered for addressing the vulnerability. It does not constitute a formal assessment of risks and remediations for your organization.

### How to determine if your system is vulnerable

First, confirm whether your organizationâs Kubernetes deployment is affected by the vulnerability. Make sure to check which versions of the Kubernetes platform your organization is running and whether they match those identified within the affected list. If you are running off of an as-a-service model, check with your provider to confirm whether they have performed the proper remediation / mitigation steps on their services.

Versions of Kubernetes affected by this vulnerability include:

* Kubernetes v1.0.x-1.9.x
* Kubernetes v1.10.0-1.10.10 (fixed in v1.10.11)
* Kubernetes v1.11.0-1.11.4 (fixed in v1.11.5)
* Kubernetes v1.12.0-1.12.2 (fixed in v1.12.3)

The vulnerability has been fixed in the following distributions (visit the GitHub link for actionable steps):

* v1.10.11
* v1.11.5
* v1.12.3
* v1.13.0-rc.1

The following cloud service providers have released public notices that the software behind their Kubernetes as-a-service offerings have been patched; customers on these platforms are advised to take quick action in downloading applicable patches:

* [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/security-bulletins) (GCP)
* [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/aks-clusters-patched-for-kubernetes-vulnerability/)
* [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/AWS-2018-020/)

If you find that youâre running a version of Kubernetes affected by the vulnerability, then your organization is susceptible to an attack and should begin to consider the following risk factors.

### Risk Factors

The Kubernetes CVE-2018-1002105 does not pose the same risk levels to all organizations running the platform. There are several factors that play into such determinations. The risk factors presented here do not represent a âcomprehensiveâ list, but they do represent some of the key variables you should consider when understanding how such a vulnerability may impact your environment(s). They include the following:

![](https://assets.coalfire.com/prod/images/imported/Blog-Images-2018-KV1.png)

Think of these variables as levers, and as these levers move one way vs. another, your organizationâs risk may increase or decrease accordingly.

## Data Types and Volume

Data types and their volume are probably the foremost thing to be concerned about when evaluating your risk exposure to a vulnerability such as the recent Kubernetes CVE-2018-1002105. You should be asking yourself how important the data within your application(s) are to

* Your organization (e.g., firm Intellectual Property)
* To your customers / end users (e.g., payment data, personally identifiable data, etc.)
* To the public (e.g., national defense secrets)

In some cases, such as firm intellectual property, it is up to your organization to assign the value at risk for preserving the confidentiality, integrity, and/or available of that data against a vulnerability. For other data types (such as personally identifiable information, protected health information, and payment card or financial data), the risks and consequences of failing to protect data are not entirely up to you, but also involve input by additional parties (such as regulatory agencies).

The more sensitive and/or valuable data types and volumes your organization possesses, the greater your risks are for not patching the Kubernetes CVE-2018-1002105.

![](https://assets.coalfire.com/prod/images/imported/Blog-Images-2018-KV2.png)

## Data Flows

The next step is to consider how data flows in relation to your organizationâs Kubernetes-based environment(s). Specifically, key data flows include users and system accounts that access the Kubernetes API services, as well as services the Kubernetes and containers are connected to.

On one end of the spectrum, you may have a Kubernetes deployment with an internet-exposed API, and several connections between its containers and additional services and/or applications. In this case, your organization may be at higher risk than having a Kubernetes deployment with private-facing API services and limited service connections.

The more open your network access is to your Kubernetes API service (as well other services connected to your Kubernetes and/or containers), the greater your risks.

![](https://assets.coalfire.com/prod/images/imported/Blog-Images-2018-KV3.png)

## User Populations

Another key variable is your user population as it pertains to the Kubernetes deployment. Your organization should consider what types of user populations it has, which of those have access to the Kubernetes services, and the level of permissions those user populations require (i.e., Role-based Access Control, or RBAC).

The Kubernetes CVE-2018-1002105 GitHub page provides a breakdown of the user types that can potentially access the API services. They range from anonymous users to privileged admin accounts. Your organization should find out which of these account types currently exist for your Kubernetes deployment. If your user population for the API is already limited to a handful of privileged accounts, authorized to run exec/attach/portforward transactions (with all other API accounts removed and/or permissions disabled), then the level of risk may be lowered. Compare this to a Kubernetes deployment that has business cases dependent upon anonymous accounts, authenticated-non-privileged accounts, as well as privileged accounts, which may have a higher level of associated risk.

The larger your user population and RBAC requirements related to the Kubernetes services, the greater your risks.

### Remediation and Mitigation ApproachesÂ

To be clear, the optimal remediation decision for the Kubernetes CVE-2018-1002105 is to **update to a version containing the security patch**. That said, running version updates may not be an immediate option for some organizations that require longer lead times to perform proper change management and testing. For those organizations, there may be shorter-term options to help mitigate risks until the time that the Kubernetes CVE-2018-1002105 patch can be promoted to production.

## Determine Responsibility

The first step is to determine who exactly is responsible for taking the remediation steps. This will depend on the nature of your Kubernetes deployment. There are two main categories here:

* **Kubernetes As-a-Service** â In this case, your organization will have no control over patching, as this falls onto the service provider under their shared responsibility, or
* **Managed Kubernetes on Virtual Machines** â In this case, your organization assumes full responsible for taking remediation / mitigation steps

If you find that your organization owns responsibility for the Kubernetes CVE-2018-1002105 remediation / mitigation, then you may consider the following options.

## Run Updates to Patch the Kubernetes Vulnerability

The most straightforward approach for remediating the Kubernetes CVE-2018-1002105 is to run an update to a version identified as containing the security patch. These versions can be found on the [GitHub repo page](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/71411) for the vulnerability.

## Modify Configurations to the Kubernetes API

As mentioned, if running an immediate update is not a viable option for your organizationâs deployment, the Kubernetes GitHub page has provided a number of API configuration changes, which may help to reduce risk exposure associated with the vulnerability. These include:

* Suspending the Kubernetes aggregated API servers (i.e., shutting down API services)
* Disabling capabilities that allow anonymous requests to be passed by the API services
* Removing all anonymous access to all Kubernetes aggregated API services
* Removing all access from any users not authorized to have privileged access on Kubernetes, and/or
* Removing production exec/attach/portforward permissions from any user who should not be able to have full access to Kubernetes

This mitigation helps to address data flow and user population-related risks. These API configuration changes modify user access permissions (which makes sense given the nature of the vulnerability). They equate to either completely turning off API services or removing accounts and/or permissions for all accounts (except those that should have elevated access).

The Kubernetes GitHub page provides specific details on how to enforce these configurations.

**Note:** These configuration changes may impact additional services by disrupting transactions dependent on use of the Kubernetes API services. Your organization should first determine if and where these dependencies may exist prior to committing changes. Additionally, these changes should only be considered for short-term risk mitigation until the time that the patch can implemented.

## Remove the Kubernetes API Exposure from Public Exposure

This mitigation is related to data flow risks. It consists of changing routing and firewall rules to pull your Kubernetes API servers back from public exposure (if it is not already). As with making API access configuration changes, your organization should first understand its requirements around the Kubernetes API services, identify where external dependencies may exist, and determine whether such network access changes will impact functionalities.

Again, this option does not remediate the vulnerability; rather, it is a risk mitigation until proper patching can be performed. Your organization will still have risks associated with privilege escalation originating from inside the network.

## Password, Secret Rotation, and Access Certification Exercise

One of the complexities of the Kubernetes CVE-2018-1002105 is that it allows unauthorized transactions to go undetected. As a result, organizations should follow the assumption that their application environment has already been compromised. An immediate exercise should be taken to enforce password resets, key rotations, as well as access certification steps. This process will help to identify, remove, and/or thwart accounts that may have been created or modified from executing malicious activities against your environment.

# CVE-2018-16873

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2018-16872.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2018-16874.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2018-16873 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-16873)

#### Description

In Go before 1.10.6 and 1.11.x before 1.11.3, the "go get" command is vulnerable to remote code execution when executed with the -u flag and the import path of a malicious Go package, or a package that imports it directly or indirectly. Specifically, it is only vulnerable in GOPATH mode, but not in module mode (the distinction is documented at https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Module\_aware\_go\_get). Using custom domains, it's possible to arrange things so that a Git repository is cloned to a folder named ".git" by using a vanity import path that ends with "/.git". If the Git repository root contains a "HEAD" file, a "config" file, an "objects" directory, a "refs" directory, with some work to ensure the proper ordering of operations, "go get -u" can be tricked into considering the parent directory as a repository root, and running Git commands on it. That will use the "config" file in the original Git repository root for its configuration, and if that config file contains malicious commands, they will execute on the system running "go get -u".

Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open source system for managing [containerized applications](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/)
across multiple hosts. It provides basic mechanisms for the deployment, maintenance,
and scaling of applications.

Kubernetes builds upon a decade and a half of experience at Google running
production workloads at scale using a system called [Borg](https://research.google.com/pubs/pub43438.html?authuser=1),
combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.

Kubernetes is hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation ([CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/about)).
If your company wants to help shape the evolution of
technologies that are container-packaged, dynamically scheduled,
and microservices-oriented, consider joining the CNCF.
For details about who's involved and how Kubernetes plays a role,
read the CNCF [announcement](https://cncf.io/news/announcement/2015/07/new-cloud-native-computing-foundation-drive-alignment-among-container).

---

## To start using K8s

See our documentation on [kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io).

Take a free course on [Scalable Microservices with Kubernetes](https://www.udacity.com/course/scalable-microservices-with-kubernetes--ud615).

To use Kubernetes code as a library in other applications, see the [list of published components](https://git.k8s.io/kubernetes/staging/README.md).
Use of the `k8s.io/kubernetes` module or `k8s.io/kubernetes/...` packages as libraries is not supported.

## To start developing K8s

The [community repository](https://git.k8s.io/community) hosts all information about
building Kubernetes from source, how to contribute code
and documentation, who to contact about what, etc.

If you want to build Kubernetes right away there are two options:

##### You have a working [Go environment](https://go.dev/doc/install).

```
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes
cd kubernetes
make

```

##### You have a working [Docker environment](https://docs.docker.com/engine).

```
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes
cd kubernetes
make quick-release

```

For the full story, head over to the [developer's documentation](https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel#readme).

## Support

If you need support, start with the [troubleshooting guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/),
and work your way through the process that we've outlined.

That said, if you have questions, reach out to us
[one way or another](https://git.k8s.io/community/communication).

## Community Meetings

The [Calendar](https://www.kubernetes.dev/resources/calendar/) has the list of all the meetings in the Kubernetes community in a single location.

## Adopters

The [User Case Studies](https://kubernetes.io/case-studies/) website has real-world use cases of organizations across industries that are deploying/migrating to Kubernetes.

## Governance

Kubernetes project is governed by a framework of principles, values, policies and processes to help our community and constituents towards our shared goals.

The [Kubernetes Community](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/governance.md) is the launching point for learning about how we organize ourselves.

The [Kubernetes Steering community repo](https://github.com/kubernetes/steering) is used by the Kubernetes Steering Committee, which oversees governance of the Kubernetes project.

## Roadmap

The [Kubernetes Enhancements repo](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements) provides information about Kubernetes releases, as well as feature tracking and backlogs.

Sure, give me a day or two to get it out. I'll cross-post

actually makes sense.

Whatever list admins/members are comfortable with.

Yes, this is tricky. Maybe "Microsoft Linux Systems Group"? Thats our
group name within Microsoft. I guess that we can also add a short wiki
page with references to the products/distros we support as well as a
clarification that this has nothing to do with Windows and list MSRC's
contact information.

As I've indicated before, we intend to follow the list's policies.
Information obtained from the list will be used only for the purposes
listed in our original application, and any additional future use will
go through the list for approvals first.

### Insights vulnerability analysis

[View exposed systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/vulnerability/cves/CVE-2018-1002105)

* Overview
* Impact
* Diagnose
* Resolve

A flaw has been detected in kubernetes which allows privilege escalation and access to sensitive information in OpenShift products and services.  This issue has been assigned [CVE-2018-1002105](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2018-1002105) and has a security impact of [Critical](https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/).

All 3.x versions of OpenShift Container Platform allow for compromise of pods (multiple running container instances) running on a compute node to which a pod is scheduled with normal user privilege.  This access could include access to all secrets, pods, environment  variables, running pod/container processes, and persistent volumes.

Additionally, on  OpenShift Container Platform versions 3.6 and higher, this vulnerability allows cluster-admin level access to any API hosted by an aggregated API server.  This includes the ‘metrics-service’ and ‘servicecatalog’ as possible targets. Cluster-admin level access to the service catalog allows creation of brokered services by an unauthenticated user with escalated privileges in any namespace and on any node. This could allow an attacker to deploy malicious code, or alter existing brokered services.

For OpenShift Dedicated environments, a regular user, with **pod exec/attach/portforward** permissions, can gain cluster-level administrative privileges on any compute node that can run that pod.  This includes **exec** access to all running workloads, all current secrets, logs, etc..

## Background Information

The OpenShift API Server is included in all OpenShift Container Platform installations and handles all the administration tasks for the cluster. Administrators and developers don’t usually call the API directly, but use the ‘oc’ binary, which calls the API server.

The API server provides various functionality, including the following oc commands:

* oc exec
* oc port-forward
* oc rsh

It does this by acting as a reverse proxy to the [kubelet](https://access.redhat.com/bounce/?externalURL=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.openshift.com%2Fcontainer-platform%2F3.11%2Farchitecture%2Finfrastructure_components%2Fkubernetes_infrastructure.html%23kubelet) running on the compute nodes. When connecting to the kubelet in order to fulfill any of the above commands, it opens a websocket connection which connects stdin, stdout, or stderr to the administrator or developer’s original call. For more information, read the [Remote Commands section of the OpenShift Container Platform 3.11 architecture guide](https://access.redhat.com/bounce/?externalURL=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.openshift.com%2Fcontainer-platform%2F3.11%2Farchitecture%2Fnetworking%2Fremote_commands.html).

The API Server also acts as a reverse proxy when implementing the [API Aggregation feature of Kubernetes](https://access.redhat.com/bounce/?externalURL=https%3A%2F%2Fkubernetes.io%2Fdocs%2Fconcepts%2Fextend-kubernetes%2Fapi-extension%2Fapiserver-aggregation%2F). API aggregation enables the installation of additional Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) into the core API Server. Those additional APIs are referred to as API extensions by upstream Kubernetes. API Extensions allow an architect to extend the features of OpenShift Container Platform 3.

## Acknowledgements

Red Hat would like to thank the Kubernetes Product Security Team for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Darren Shepherd as the original reporter.

## Impacted Products

Red Hat Product Security has rated [CVE-2018-1002105](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2018-1002105) as having a security impact of [Critical](http://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/).

The following Red Hat Product versions are impacted:

* Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.x
* Red Hat OpenShift Online
* Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated

## Attack Description and Impact

The OpenShift API server is a component which handles the API requests for OpenShift Container Platform 3. The OpenShift API server had a vulnerability in the ‘upgradeawarehandler’ type which acts as a reverse proxy to the compute nodes and other services added as API Extensions. A flaw in the reverse proxy prevented it from closing connections from the downstream service when there was an error. This allowed the user making the API call to escalate their privileges.

There are 2 ways to use this vulnerability to attack OpenShift Container Platform, OpenShift Online, or OpenShift Dedicated. The first involves abusing pod **exec**, **attach**, or **portforward** privileges granted to a normal user, and the second involves attacking the API extensions feature which provides the service catalog and access to additional features in OpenShift Container Platform 3.6 and later.

If a user has pod **exec/attach/portforward** privileges for any pod, their privileges can be escalated to cluster-admin, and any API call to a compute node Kubelet api can be achieved. An API call to the Kubelet api allows the user to **exec** into any container running on the same node as the pod which they have privileges for, including privileged containers which have read/write access to the host filesystem.

The second attack doesn’t require any privileges and exploits the API extension feature used by ‘metrics-server’ and ‘servicecatalog’ in OpenShift Container Platform, OpenShift Online, and Dedicated. It allows an unauthenticated user to gain cluster-admin privileges to any API extension deployed to the cluster including ‘servicecatalog’. Cluster-admin access to ‘servicecatalog’ allows creation of service brokers in any namespace and on any node.

## Diagnose your vulnerability

To check the version of OpenShift container platform installed send an http request to the API server, such as (Note: The URL should be the same as the webconsole URL):

*curl https://openshift.example.com:8443/version/openshift | grep gitVersion*

\*port is configuration specific

Alternatively if you are logged in with the ‘**oc**’ command you can check the version with this command:

*oc version*

Any versions of OpenShift Container Platform older than those listed below are vulnerable:

* v3.11.43-1
* v3.10.72-1
* v3.9.51-1
* v3.8.44-1
* v3.7.72-1
* v3.6.173.0.140-1
* v3.5.5.31.80-1
* v3.4.1.44.57-1
* v3.3.1.46.45-1
* v3.2.1.34-2

## Take Action

Customers running affected versions of Red Hat products are strongly recommended to update them as soon as errata are available.

OpenShift Online (Starter, Pro) have been remediated.  OpenShift Dedicated customers should speak with their support contact to confirm the status/schedule for these fixes.

## Mitigation

Fixes for OpenShift Container Platform versions 3.2 and higher have been shipped to mitigate the flaw.

Users who update to the latest versions do not need to apply further mitigations. However, if the updates cannot be applied, mitigating the issue is recommended.

### Mitigate the pod exec/attach/port-forward attack (OCP 3.2->3.11)

Change the default admin, and edit roles which have pod attach/exec/port-forward:

> $oc edit clusterrole admin

Add the ‘rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate’ annotation with a value of false, and remove the pod attach/exec/portforward permissions. Example:

> apiVersion: v1
> kind: ClusterRole
> metadata:
>    annotations:
>       openshift.io/description: A user that has edit rights within the project and can
>         change the project's membership.
>    creationTimestamp: 2018-11-21T01:34:04Z

Do the same for the ‘edit’ role which also has these permissions.

### For a single user in a project:

> Check the roles assigned to the user. In this case, the admin role is assigned to the quicklab user:
>
> $ oc project myproj
> $ oc adm policy who-can get pods/exec
> Namespace: test
> Verb:      get
> Resource:  pods/exec
>
> Users:  quicklab
>         system:admin
>         system:serviceaccount:kube-system:generic-garbage-collector
>         system:serviceaccount:kube-system:namespace-controller
>
> Groups: system:cluster-admins
>         system:masters
>
>
> $ oc get rolebindings
> NAME                    ROLE                    USERS      GROUPS                          SERVICE ACCOUNTS   SUBJECTS
> admin           /admin          quicklab
> system:deployers        /system:deployer                                                   deployer
> system:image-builders   /system:image-builder                                              builder
> system:image-pullers    /system:image-puller               system:serviceaccounts:myproj
> $ oc export clusterrole admin > admin-mitigate.yml

Edit admin-mitigate.yml by adding a ‘rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate’ annotation with a value of false, changing the name and removing the pod attach/exec/portforward permissions. Example:

> apiVersion: v1
> kind: ClusterRole
> metadata:
>   annotations:
>     openshift.io/description: A user that has edit rights within the project and can
>       change the project's membership.
>     rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate: "false"
>   creationTimestamp: null
>   name: admin-mitigate
> rules:
> - apiGroups:
>   - ""
>   attributeRestrictions: null
>   resources:
>   - pods
>   - pods/proxy
>   verbs:
>    ...

Create a new role with the new configuration:

> $ cat admin-mitigate.yml | oc create -f -

Assign this role to any users who you don’t want to have those permissions:

> $ oc adm policy remove-role-from-user admin quicklab
> role "admin" removed: "quicklab"
> $oc adm policy add-role-to-user admin-mitigate quicklab
> role “admin-mitigate’”added: “quicklab”

### Mitigating the API Extension attack (OCP 3.6 -> 3.11)

To mitigate the API extension attack until such time that a cluster upgrade to a patched version can be completed, it is possible to delete the affected API Extensions. Please review each services carefully to ensure this will not cause a loss of critical functionality, in which case alternate protections such as network level restrictions to known sources may be more appropriate.

Get a list of services which need to be disabled:

> $ oc get apiservices -o=custom-columns=NAME:.[metadata.name](https://access.redhat.com/bounce/?externalURL=http%3A%2F%2Fmetadata.name),SERVICE:.spec.service,STATUS:.status.conditions[0].type,VALUE:.status.conditions[0].status | grep -v '<nil>'

For example, on OCP 3.11 the services might include:

> | NAME | SERVICE | STATUS | VALUE |
> | --- | --- | --- | --- |
> | v1beta1.servicecatalog.k8s.io | map[name:apiserver namespace:kube-service-catalog] | Available | True |

Disable the services listed in the output, for example:

> $ oc delete svc apiserver -n kube-service-catalog

For this example, to re-enable service-catalog run the openshift-service-catalog playbook. Please refer to the product documentation to re-enable other services.

> $ ansible-playbook [-i /path/to/inventory]
> /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/openshift-service-catalog/config.yml

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A3752)

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release 3.4.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Critical. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is Red Hat's cloud computing Kubernetes application platform solution designed for on-premise or private cloud deployments.

Security Fix(es):

* A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in OpenShift Container Platform 3.x which allows for compromise of pods running on a compute node to which a pod is scheduled with normal user privilege. This access could include access to all secrets, pods, environment variables, running pod/container processes, and persistent volumes, including in privileged containers. Additionally, on versions 3.6 and higher of OpenShift Container Platform, this vulnerability allows cluster-admin level access to any API hosted by an aggregated API server. This includes the ‘servicecatalog’ API which is installed by default in 3.7 and later. Cluster-admin level access to the service catalog allows creation of brokered services by an unauthenticated user with escalated privileges in any namespace and on any node. This could lead to an attacker being allowed to deploy malicious code, or alter existing services. (CVE-2018-1002105)

This advisory contains the RPM packages for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.4. See the following advisory for the container images for this release:

# CVE-2018-16874

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2018-16873.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2018-16875.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2018-16874 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-16874)

#### Description

In Go before 1.10.6 and 1.11.x before 1.11.3, the "go get" command is vulnerable to directory traversal when executed with the import path of a malicious Go package which contains curly braces (both '{' and '}' characters). Specifically, it is only vulnerable in GOPATH mode, but not in module mode (the distinction is documented at https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Module\_aware\_go\_get). The attacker can cause an arbitrary filesystem write, which can lead to code execution.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

Can I suggest that we fork the discussion around security-bugs.rst to
LKML? I can suggest an initial patch to address your comments here but I
think that this is better handled on LKML.

My concern with Monday is timezones: we should do the math here, but I'd
like to avoid spilling over to Sunday (or very early Monday for that
matter) for some timezones.

As far as I understand specific dates for the microarchitectural bugs
were set pretty late in the process.

It's not just the microarchitectural bugs I was referring to, we are
getting security reports from users about security bugs in various
distros and we end up circling back with relevant distros to patch them
up. A recent example would be:
[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1834499](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/%2Bbug/1834499) where an
internal user has reported a kernel memory leak due to a missing patch
in Ubuntu.

Microsoft's history with Linux is a rather recent one. I can offer the
following examples if you're willing to give us a few months off of the
"1 year" requirement:

CVE-2018-1002105: <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/aks-clusters-patched-for-kubernetes-vulnerability/>

I'd love to develop a framework that would allow for sharing of reports
between linux-distros/security@.../MSRC given the explicit approval of
the reporter. I think that the current "silo" model is broken.

Microsoft in general, and MSRC in particular have proved during
Meltdown/Spectre that they are a trusted entity which can work well with
the open source community to advance our common goals.

Subject: Re: linux-distros membership application - Microsoft

Hi all,

Per our current policy and precedents, I see no valid reasons not to
subscribe Microsoft (or part(s) of it, see below) to linux-distros.  So
I intend to figure out some detail and proceed with the subscription.

The only voiced reasons not to, such as in Georgi Guninski's posting and
in comments on some technology news sites that covered Microsoft's
request, are irrelevant per our currently specified membership criteria.

Besides, (at least to me) Microsoft doesn't look all that different from
many other large corporations, including some which already have their
Linux distro teams represented on the list.  Microsoft has a lasting
stigma from its past actions from long ago.  IMO, we shouldn't let that
result in a biased decision against current Microsoft, effectively
favoring other corporations who might not be any better currently, but
just don't have that established stigma.

The oldest of these is August 8, 2018, which is just 1 month short of
the 1 year term.  I suppose we could either give Microsoft this 1 month
off as you suggest based on Microsoft's track record of promptly dealing
with security issues in non-Linux products, or subscribe Microsoft to
linux-distros in August 2019 (or later).

More importantly, maybe we shouldn't list "Microsoft" as a member of
linux-distros.  Microsoft is so much more than the recent Linux-based
products and services.  We similarly list "Amazon Linux AMI" rather than
"Amazon", and "Chrome OS" rather than "Google" (and we had separately
listed "Android", which has since unsubscribed), and "Ubuntu" rather
than "Canonical".  OTOH, we were not as careful to list proper products,
etc. for some others such as "Oracle".

If we list "Microsoft", this might be especially confusing since issues
being reported might also be relevant to Windows.  The reporters need to
know they're not reaching Windows security team unless they specifically
authorize that.

Any suggestions on the above?

Regardless, the list policy only allows use of the information for
"getting the issue fixed for your distro's users and, only in rare
extreme cases, for deployment of maximally non-revealing changes to
maintain security of your distro's infrastructure most essential to the
distro users' security in face of the security issue being dealt with.
The need-to-know condition is met only if the person needs to
participate in one of these two activities."  This is meant to preclude
sharing within the organization beyond its parts responsible for the
"distro" the organization is subscribed for.

## Synopsis

Critical: OpenShift Container Platform 3.11 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A3537)

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Critical. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is Red Hat's cloud computing Kubernetes application platform solution designed for on-premise or private cloud deployments.

Security Fix(es):

* A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in OpenShift Container Platform 3.x which allows for compromise of pods running on a compute node to which a pod is scheduled with normal user privilege. This access could include access to all secrets, pods, environment variables, running pod/container processes, and persistent volumes, including in privileged containers. Additionally, on versions 3.6 and higher of OpenShift Container Platform, this vulnerability allows cluster-admin level access to any API hosted by an aggregated API server. This includes the ‘servicecatalog’ API which is installed by default in 3.7 and later. Cluster-admin level access to the service catalog allows creation of brokered services by an unauthenticated user with escalated privileges in any namespace and on any node. This could lead to an attacker being allowed to deploy malicious code, or alter existing services. (CVE-2018-1002105)
* nodejs: Out of bounds (OOB) write via UCS-2 encoding (CVE-2018-12115)
* kibana: Cross-site scripting via the source field formatter (CVE-2018-3830)

Space precludes documenting all of the bug fixes and enhancements in this advisory. See the following Release Notes documentation for details about these changes:

<https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/release_notes/ocp_3_11_release_notes.html>

All OpenShift Container Platform 3.11 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages and images.

## Solution

# Understanding GitHub Code Search syntax

You can build search queries for the results you want with specialized code qualifiers, regular expressions, and boolean operations.

## [About code search query structure](#about-code-search-query-structure)

The search syntax in this article only applies to searching code with GitHub code search. Note that the syntax and qualifiers for searching for non-code content, such as issues, users, and discussions, is not the same as the syntax for code search. For more information on non-code search, see [About searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/about-searching-on-github) and [Searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/searching-on-github).

Search queries consist of search terms, comprising text you want to search for, and qualifiers, which narrow down the search.

A bare term with no qualifiers will match either the content of a file or the file's path.

For example, the following query:

```
http-push

```

The above query will match the file `docs/http-push.txt`, even if it doesn't contain the term `http-push`. It will also match a file called `example.txt` if it contains the term `http-push`.

You can enter multiple terms separated by whitespace to search for documents that satisfy both terms.

For example, the following query:

```
sparse index

```

The search results would include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order. As examples, it would match a file containing `SparseIndexVector`, a file with the phrase `index for sparse trees`, and even a file named `index.txt` that contains the term `sparse`.

Searching for multiple terms separated by whitespace is the equivalent to the search `hello AND world`. Other boolean operations, such as `hello OR world`, are also supported. For more information about boolean operations, see [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations).

Code search also supports searching for an exact string, including whitespace. For more information, see [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match).

You can narrow your code search with specialized qualifiers, such as `repo:`, `language:` and `path:`. For more information on the qualifiers you can use in code search, see [Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers).

You can also use regular expressions in your searches by surrounding the expression in slashes. For more information on using regular expressions, see [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

## [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match)

To search for an exact string, including whitespace, you can surround the string in quotes. For example:

```
"sparse index"

```

You can also use quoted strings in qualifiers, for example:

```
path:git language:"protocol buffers"

```
## [Searching for quotes and backslashes](#searching-for-quotes-and-backslashes)

To search for code containing a quotation mark, you can escape the quotation mark using a backslash. For example, to find the exact string `name = "tensorflow"`, you can search:

```
"name = \"tensorflow\""

```

To search for code containing a backslash, `\`, use a double backslash, `\\`.

The two escape sequences `\\` and `\"` can be used outside of quotes as well. No other escape sequences are recognized, though. A backslash that isn't followed by either `"` or `\` is included in the search, unchanged.

Additional escape sequences, such as `\n` to match a newline character, are supported in regular expressions. See [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

## [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations)

Code search supports boolean expressions. You can use the operators `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` to combine search terms.

By default, adjacent terms separated by whitespace are equivalent to using the `AND` operator. For example, the search query `sparse index` is the same as `sparse AND index`, meaning that the search results will include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order.

To search for documents containing either one term or the other, you can use the `OR` operator. For example, the following query will match documents containing either `sparse` or `index`:

```
sparse OR index

```

To exclude files from your search results, you can use the `NOT` operator. For example, to exclude files in the `__testing__` directory, you can search:

```
"fatal error" NOT path:__testing__

```

You can use parentheses to express more complicated boolean expressions. For example:

```
(language:ruby OR language:python) AND NOT path:"/tests/"

```
## [Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers)

You can use specialized keywords to qualify your search.

* [Repository qualifier](#repository-qualifier)
* [Organization and user qualifiers](#organization-and-user-qualifiers)
* [Language qualifier](#language-qualifier)
* [Path qualifier](#path-qualifier)
* [Symbol qualifier](#symbol-qualifier)
* [Content qualifier](#content-qualifier)
* [Is qualifier](#is-qualifier)

### [Repository qualifier](#repository-qualifier)

To search within a repository, use the `repo:` qualifier. You must provide the full repository name, including the owner. For example:

```
repo:github-linguist/linguist

```

To search within a set of repositories, you can combine multiple `repo:` qualifiers with the boolean operator `OR`. For example:

```
repo:github-linguist/linguist OR repo:tree-sitter/tree-sitter

```

Note

Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for repository names, so you will have to type the entire repository name (including the user prefix) for the `repo:` qualifier to work.

### [Organization and user qualifiers](#organization-and-user-qualifiers)

To search for files within an organization, use the `org:` qualifier. For example:

```
org:github

```

To search for files within a personal account, use the `user:` qualifier. For example:

```
user:octocat

```

Note

Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for organization or user names, so you will have to type the entire organization or user name for the qualifier to work.

### [Language qualifier](#language-qualifier)

To narrow down to a specific languages, use the `language:` qualifier. For example:

```
language:ruby OR language:cpp OR language:csharp

```

For a complete list of supported language names, see [languages.yaml](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/main/lib/linguist/languages.yml) in [github-linguist/linguist](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist). If your preferred language is not on the list, you can open a pull request to add it.

### [Path qualifier](#path-qualifier)

To search within file paths, use the `path:` qualifier. This will match files containing the term anywhere in their file path. For example, to find files containing the term `unit_tests` in their path, use:

```
path:unit_tests

```

The above query will match both `src/unit_tests/my_test.py` and `src/docs/unit_tests.md` since they both contain `unit_test` somewhere in their path.

To match only a specific filename (and not part of the path), you could use a regular expression:

```
path:/(^|\/)README\.md$/

```

Note that the `.` in the filename is escaped, since `.` has special meaning for regular expressions. For more information about using regular expressions, see [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

You can also use some limited glob expressions in the `path:` qualifier.

For example, to search for files with the extension `txt`, you can use:

```
path:*.txt

```

To search for JavaScript files within a `src` directory, you could use:
```
path:src/*.js

```

* By default, glob expressions are not anchored to the start of the path, so the above expression would still match a path like `app/src/main.js`. But if you prefix the expression with `/`, it will anchor to the start. For example:

  ```
  path:/src/*.js

  ```
* Note that `*` doesn't match the `/` character, so for the above example, all results will be direct descendants of the `src` directory. To match within subdirectories, so that results include deeply nested files such as `/src/app/testing/utils/example.js`, you can use `**`. For example:

  ```
  path:/src/**/*.js

  ```

You can also use the `?` global character. For example, to match the path `file.aac` or `file.abc`, you can use:

```
path:*.a?c

```

To search for a filename which contains a special character like `\*` or `?`, just use a quoted string:
```
path:"file?"

```

Glob expressions are disabled for quoted strings, so the above query will only match paths containing the literal string `file?`.

### [Symbol qualifier](#symbol-qualifier)

You can search for symbol definitions in code, such as function or class definitions, using the `symbol:` qualifier. Symbol search is based on parsing your code using the open source [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) parser ecosystem, so no extra setup or build tool integration is required.

For example, to search for a symbol called `WithContext`:

```
language:go symbol:WithContext

```

In some languages, you can search for symbols using a prefix (e.g. a prefix of their class name). For example, for a method `deleteRows` on a struct `Maint`, you could search `symbol:Maint.deleteRows` if you are using Go, or `symbol:Maint::deleteRows` in Rust.

You can also use regular expressions with the symbol qualifier. For example, the following query would find conversions people have implemented in Rust for the `String` type:

```
language:rust symbol:/^String::to_.*/

```

Note that this qualifier only searches for definitions and not references, and not all symbol types or languages are fully supported yet. Symbol extraction is supported for the following languages:

* Bash
* C
* C#
* C++
* CodeQL
* Elixir
* Go
* JSX
* Java
* JavaScript
* Lua
* PHP
* Protocol Buffers
* Python
* R
* Ruby
* Rust
* Scala
* Starlark
* Swift
* Typescript

We are working on adding support for more languages. If you would like to help contribute to this effort, you can add support for your language in the open source [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) parser ecosystem, upon which symbol search is based.

### [Content qualifier](#content-qualifier)

By default, bare terms search both paths and file content. To restrict a search to strictly match the content of a file and not file paths, use the `content:` qualifier. For example:

```
content:README.md

```

This query would only match files containing the term `README.md`, rather than matching files named `README.md`.

### [Is qualifier](#is-qualifier)

To filter based on repository properties, you can use the `is:` qualifier. `is:` supports the following values:

* `archived`: restricts the search to archived repositories.
* `fork`: restricts the search to forked repositories.
* `vendored`: restricts the search to content detected as vendored.
* `generated`: restricts the search to content detected as generated.

For example:

```
path:/^MIT.txt$/ is:archived

```

Note that the `is:` qualifier can be inverted with the `NOT` operator. To search for non-archived repositories, you can search:

```
log4j NOT is:archived

```

To exclude forks from your results, you can search:

```
log4j NOT is:fork

```
## [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions)

Code search supports regular expressions to search for patterns in your code. You can use regular expressions in bare search terms as well as within many qualifiers, by surrounding the regex in slashes.

For example, to search for the regular expression `sparse.*index`, you would use:

```
/sparse.*index/

```

Note that you'll have to escape any forward slashes within the regular expression. For example, to search for files within the `App/src` directory, you would use:

```
/^App\/src\//

```

Inside a regular expression, `\n` stands for a newline character, `\t` stands for a tab, and `\x{hhhh}` can be used to escape any Unicode character. This means you can use regular expressions to search for exact strings that contain characters that you can't type into the search bar.

Most common regular expressions features work in code search. However, "look-around" assertions are not supported.

## [Separating search terms](#separating-search-terms)

All parts of a search, such as search terms, exact strings, regular expressions, qualifiers, parentheses, and the boolean keywords `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`, must be separated from one another with spaces. The one exception is that items inside parentheses, `(` `)`, don't need to be separated from the parentheses.

If your search contains multiple components that aren't separated by spaces, or other text that does not follow the rules listed above, code search will try to guess what you mean. It often falls back on treating that component of your query as the exact text to search for. For example, the following query:

```
printf("hello world\n");

```

Code search will give up on interpreting the parentheses and quotes as special characters and will instead search for files containing that exact code.

If code search guesses wrong, you can always get the search you wanted by using quotes and spaces to make the meaning clear.

## [Case sensitivity](#case-sensitivity)

By default, code search is case-insensitive, and results will include both uppercase and lowercase results. You can do case-sensitive searches by using a regular expression with case insensitivity turned off. For example, to search for the string "True", you would use:

```
/(?-i)True/

```

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A3551)

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.8.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Critical. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is Red Hat's cloud computing Kubernetes application platform solution designed for on-premise or private cloud deployments.

Security Fix(es):

* A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in OpenShift Container Platform 3.x which allows for compromise of pods running on a compute node to which a pod is scheduled with normal user privilege. This access could include access to all secrets, pods, environment variables, running pod/container processes, and persistent volumes, including in privileged containers. Additionally, on versions 3.6 and higher of OpenShift Container Platform, this vulnerability allows cluster-admin level access to any API hosted by an aggregated API server. This includes the ‘servicecatalog’ API which is installed by default in 3.7 and later. Cluster-admin level access to the service catalog allows creation of brokered services by an unauthenticated user with escalated privileges in any namespace and on any node. This could lead to an attacker being allowed to deploy malicious code, or alter existing services. (CVE-2018-1002105)

This advisory contains the RPM packages for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.8.44. See the following advisory for the container images for this release:

[https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2018:3550](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2018%3A3550)

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Critical. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is Red Hat's cloud computing Kubernetes application platform solution designed for on-premise or private cloud deployments.

Security Fix(es):

* A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in OpenShift Container Platform 3.x which allows for compromise of pods running on a compute node to which a pod is scheduled with normal user privilege. This access could include access to all secrets, pods, environment variables, running pod/container processes, and persistent volumes, including in privileged containers. Additionally, on versions 3.6 and higher of OpenShift Container Platform, this vulnerability allows cluster-admin level access to any API hosted by an aggregated API server. This includes the ‘servicecatalog’ API which is installed by default in 3.7 and later. Cluster-admin level access to the service catalog allows creation of brokered services by an unauthenticated user with escalated privileges in any namespace and on any node. This could lead to an attacker being allowed to deploy malicious code, or alter existing services. (CVE-2018-1002105)

| cizisx: [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt) Why does this MR fixes [#71411](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/71411).  Seems to me this only handles connection upgrade error. And only the connection is established, client can still send any request skipping authorization.  As far as I understand, in the buggy version, the connection upgrade error was not handled correctly when it happens, and the backend connection is left open, which leaves subsequent request to pass through to kubelet unchecked/unauthorized. Since API server authenticates to kubelet as cluster-admin, it allows attacker to run any API on kubelet. This PR rectifies the problem by closing the backend connection. |

### **[moonek](/moonek)** commented [Dec 10, 2018](#issuecomment-445782298)

| We noticed that this change only applies to the following releases. v1.10.11 v1.11.5 v1.12.3 v1.13.0-rc.1  Our old environment is using k8s 1.8.4. We are considering an upgrade k8s version, but it takes time. So I want to hotfix this commit until then.  Does the k8s 1.8.4 source rebuild solve [#71411](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/71411) vulnerability by only reflecting this commit?  When checked with the test utility below, it appears to be resolved. <https://github.com/gravitational/cve-2018-1002105> |

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
