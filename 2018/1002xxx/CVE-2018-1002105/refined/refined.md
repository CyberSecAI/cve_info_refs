Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2018-1002105:

**1. Vulnerability Overview:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the incorrect handling of error responses during proxied upgrade requests within the Kubernetes API server. This allowed an attacker to establish a TCP connection to backend servers using the API server's TLS credentials and then send arbitrary requests through this connection, bypassing normal authorization checks.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Incorrect handling of error responses in the Kubernetes API server's proxy component.
    *   Reuse of established TCP connections, which bypassed authentication and authorization checks.
    *   Lack of distinction between requests from API server and user requests during proxying.
    *   Aggregated API servers and Kubelet API are vulnerable due to shared connection credentials with the Kubernetes API server.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker could gain cluster-admin level access to aggregated APIs, such as service catalog, metrics server and the kubelet API.
    *   **Access to Sensitive Information:** The vulnerability could lead to the disclosure of sensitive data like secrets, environment variables, and persistent volumes.
    *   **Arbitrary Request Execution**:  An attacker could send arbitrary requests to back-end servers (kubelets, aggregated API servers) through the established connection. This could potentially allow arbitrary code execution by issuing malicious API requests.
    *   **Data Modification:** An attacker could add or modify data.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could potentially cause a denial of service.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Exploitation via Kubernetes API server's proxy component.
    *   Use of specially crafted requests that are processed by the vulnerable proxy component, leading to a hijacked connection with elevated privileges.
    *   Use of pod exec/attach/portforward API calls.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to establish a connection through the Kubernetes API server to a backend server (kubelet or an aggregated API server), and authorization to use  `exec`, `portforward`, or `attach` API methods on pods (for the kubelet API exploitation path).
        * Unauthenticated users could exploit this via a direct connection to the API server combined with a vulnerable API extension (for example, `servicecatalog`).

*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Disabling the use of aggregated API servers.
    *   Disabling anonymous requests to the Kubernetes API server.
    *   Limiting or removing user access to specific API server endpoints or to pod exec/attach/portforward methods.
    *   Reconfiguring networking to remove public exposure from the Kubernetes API.
    *   Password, secret rotation and access certification exercises

**4. Exploit Information:**

*   **Authenticated PoC:** An attacker with valid credentials and access to the necessary endpoints could execute arbitrary requests on the kubelet or aggregated APIs through a hijacked TCP connection.
*   **Unauthenticated PoC:** An attacker could use the anonymous discovery API to connect to aggregated API servers and perform cluster-admin-level actions, such as deploying malicious services.

**5. Additional Notes:**

*   The bug was originally reported in a non-security context, which highlights the need to identify similar issues earlier in development.
*   The complexity of coordinating fixes across multiple timezones, coupled with the need for a clear communication of risks and mitigation strategies, presented challenges during the incident response.
*   The need to test for negative scenarios is also highlighted, not just positive test cases.

In summary, CVE-2018-1002105 is a critical vulnerability in Kubernetes that could be used to escalate privileges, gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, or cause denial of service. The official fixes are contained in Kubernetes versions 1.10.11, 1.11.5 and 1.12.3. If a patch cannot be immediately deployed, mitigation options should be used to reduce the severity of the risk.
