{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The 'updateRegisterDR2000v' subroutine in the Quest DR Series Disk Backup software does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, leading to command injection vulnerabilities.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command [CWE-78]"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands with root privileges on the appliance.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted JSON-RPC request to the '/ws/v1.0/jsonrpc' endpoint, specifically targeting the 'updateRegisterDR2000v' method and injecting malicious commands into the 'LicenseServer' parameter within the 'dr2000v' object.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable appliance and be able to send HTTP POST requests with a valid session cookie. This vulnerability is part of a larger set of command injection flaws. While this specific vulnerability requires authentication, a related vulnerability in the 'Logon' method allows for unauthenticated command injection."
