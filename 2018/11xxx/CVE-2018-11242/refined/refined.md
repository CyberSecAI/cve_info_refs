Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The MakeMyTrip Android application (version 7.2.4) stores sensitive information in SQLite database files within the application's data directory (`/data/com.makemytrip/databases/` and `/data/com.makemytrip/cache/`) without proper encryption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insecure Data Storage:**  Confidential user data is stored in cleartext within SQLite databases. This lack of encryption makes the data easily accessible to unauthorized parties with file system access.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers who gain access to the device's file system can retrieve sensitive information from the unencrypted database files. This could include personal information, booking details, and potentially other confidential data stored by the application.
*   **Compromised Confidentiality:** The primary impact is the breach of confidentiality of the user data stored by the application.
*   Potential for impact to integrity and availability was mentioned.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local Access:**  An attacker needs local access to the Android device's file system to retrieve the database files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Rooted Android Device:** The attacker must be able to access the file system of the Android device, which usually requires the device to be rooted.
*  **Physical Access or Malware:** The attacker needs either physical access to the device or must use malware to gain file system access on the device.

**Additional notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to version 7.2.4 of the MakeMyTrip Android application, and potentially earlier versions.
*   The advisory recommends encrypting all confidential information stored on the device.
*   The advisory was discovered by "NinjaXshell" and later details were published on Exploit-DB by "Divya Jain".
*  The Exploit-DB entry includes a basic proof-of-concept description.
