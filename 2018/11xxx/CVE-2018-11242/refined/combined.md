Security advisory: Unencrypted storage of information in MakeMyTrip 7.2.4

 [Raw](/NinjaXshell/ba0aeee4b77b4bdea76d0c0c095d53b1/raw/0b10705eb44caf33c44030ee223230be07375d08/MakeMyTrip_7.2.4_InsecureDataStorage)

|  | The full advisory (that includes all technical details) can be found below: |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
|  | Description: Unencrypted storage of confidential information |
|  | Affects: MakeMyTrip version 7.2.4 for Android |
|  | Vendor: MakeMyTrip Android Application |
|  | Tested on: Android v5.1 |
|  | Severity: Medium |
|  | Discovery: NinjaXshell |
|  |  |
|  | Background |
|  | MakeMyTrip is a popular application that is used to book Hotels/Flights and stores various Confidential Informations. |
|  | The Android application is advertised to secure all confidential information. |
|  |  |
|  | Description |
|  | Android application folder was found to contain SQLite database files in the following subdirectory data/com.makemytrip/Cache and data/com.makemytrip/databses. This directory is used to store the application’s databases. The confidential information can be retrieved from the SQLite databases and stored in cleartext. |
|  |  |
|  | Impact |
|  | By obtaining access to the file system of an android device, an attacker can retrieve databases from the MakeMyTrip application directory. The information that can be retrieved from the content of entries in the MakeMyTrip. |
|  | An attacker can obtain access to the file system of an android device by rooting the device. Consequently, the confidentiality of information that is stored by version 7.2.4 (and possibly earlier versions) of the MAkeMyTrip application is at risk on android devices that can be rooted. |
|  |  |
|  | Solution |
|  | All confidential information that is stored on the device should be encrypted. If confidential data is stored in a remote location for backup purposes, the copy of the confidential data should also be encrypted. |
|  |  |
|  | Recommendation |
|  | The local database directly affects the confidentiality of information that is stored using version 7.2.4 of the MakeMyTrip android application. Users of the MakeMyTrip android application are therefore recommended to update the application to a version that solves the described issues or to use an alternative. |

# MakeMyTrip 7.2.4 - Information Disclosure

#### EDB-ID:

###### 44690

#### CVE:

###### [2018-11242](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-11242)

**EDB Verified:**

#### Author:

#### Type:

###### [local](/?type=local)

**Vulnerable App:**

```
# Exploit Title: Android Application MakeMyTrip 7.2.4 - Unencrypted Database Files
# Date: 2018-05-21
# Software Link: MakeMyTrip v7.2.4 Android Application
# Exploit Author: Divya Jain
# Version: 7.2.4 Android App
# CVE: CVE-2018-11242
# Category: Mobileapps
# Tested on: Android v5.1

# 1. Description
# Android application folder was found to contain SQLite database files in the following subdirectory
# data/com.makemytrip/Cache and data/com.makemytrip/databses. This directory is used to store the application’s databases.
# The confidential information can be retrieved from the SQLite databases and stored in cleartext.
# As an impact it is known to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

# 2. Proof-of-Concept
# The successful exploitation needs a single authentication and filesystem can be accessed, after rooting an android device.
# After accessing the directories below

/data/com.makemytrip/databases/
/data/com.makemytrip/cache/

# Above directories can be seen with unencrypted version of database files stored in the device
# which can further lead to sensitive information disclosure.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
