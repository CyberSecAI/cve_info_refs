### **[dependabot](/apps/dependabot) bot** commented on behalf of **github** [Jan 2, 2025](#issuecomment-2567449919)

| OK, I won't notify you again about this release, but will get in touch when a new version is available. If you'd rather skip all updates until the next major or minor version, let me know by commenting `@dependabot ignore this major version` or `@dependabot ignore this minor version`. You can also ignore all major, minor, or patch releases for a dependency by adding an [`ignore` condition](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates#ignore) with the desired `update_types` to your config file.  If you change your mind, just re-open this PR and I'll resolve any conflicts on it. |

In its place, a new Cypress end-to-end test suite has been introduced, featuring a new test file for host group dependency configuration that includes scenarios for changing properties, duplicating, and deleting dependencies. Additional fixture data for host group dependencies has also been added, along with new Cypress commands for managing these dependencies.

centreon/tests/e2e/features/HostGroups/02-host-group-dependency-configuration.feature (3)

`12-14`: **Scenarios appear consistent and well-structured.**

The scenario and step definitions clearly outline the objective of verifying property changes. Great job using descriptive steps and tags.

---

`17-20`: **Duplicate scenario is clearly defined.**

This scenario covers duplication thoroughly, ensuring that the cloned dependency retains all properties. Nicely done.

---

`22-24`: **Delete scenario is comprehensive.**

Verifying that the object doesn't reappear in the listing is a solid approach to confirming the deletion. Looks good.

centreon/tests/e2e/features/HostGroups/02-host-group-dependency-configuration/index.ts (3)

`25-39`: **Good use of beforeEach and afterEach hooks.**

Starting and stopping containers ensures clean test environments. This approach helps isolate tests effectively.

---

`116-121`: **Double-check the necessity of calling `cy.exportConfig()` immediately after duplication.**

If the duplication itself is validated by the subsequent checks, consider whether exporting config is essential here. Removing unneeded steps can speed up the test suite.

---

`154-158`: **Solid final check for deletion.**

Confirming that the element cannot be found in the listing is a dependable verification step. Nicely done.

centreon/tests/e2e/features/Hosts/commands.ts (3)

`84-124`: **Check sequential clicks for potential race conditions.**

Clearing fields, then clicking multiple labels and clearing again might lead to race conditions. Ensure each step is complete (and elements stable) before moving on to the next action.

---

`140-157`: **Interface `HostGroupDependency` is well-defined.**

Specifying all necessary fields for dependencies provides clarity for both usage and future maintenance.

---

`168-169`: **Exported Cypress commands clearly declared.**

Adding them to the global Cypress namespace helps keep your code strongly typed and discoverable.

centreon/tests/e2e/fixtures/notifications/data-for-notification.json (1)

`5-7`: **Second host group addition looks good.**

Defining `"hostGroup2": { "name": "host_group_2" }` expands testing scenarios with multiple host groups, which is beneficial for comprehensive coverage.

centreon/tests/e2e/fixtures/host-groups/dependency.json (1)

`2-19`: **Verify test data dependencies and enhance documentation**

The default configuration references specific host groups that need to be available in the test environment.

Consider these improvements:

1. Add comments explaining the meaning of `parent_relationship` values (0/1)
2. Consider adding more comprehensive test cases for failure conditions
3. Document the relationship between `hostGrpsNames` and `dependentHostGrpsNames`

✅ Verification successful

Let me verify the presence of these host groups in the test fixtures to ensure they are properly set up.

---

Let me check one more thing to verify the test setup.

---

**Host groups are properly configured in test fixtures**

The referenced host groups "Firewall" and "Linux-Servers" are well-established in the test environment:

* Found in resource filter fixtures (`centreon/cypress/fixtures/resources/filter/hostGroups.json`)
* Used across multiple test files including host configuration, dashboards, and services
* Present in both Cypress and E2E test suites

The test data dependencies are properly set up and maintained across the test environment.

🏁 Scripts executed

The following scripts were executed for the analysis:

| 📝 WalkthroughWalkthrough The pull request introduces consistent styling modifications across multiple Centreon widgets, focusing on table and progress bar presentations. The changes primarily involve adding theme-based conditional styling, specifically for global health host and service widgets, live top 10 CPU usage, and live top 10 memory usage widgets. The modifications aim to enhance visual flexibility by dynamically setting colors and spacing based on the selected theme, replacing hardcoded color styles with more adaptable approaches. Changes  | File | Change Summary | | --- | --- | | `centreon/www/widgets/global-health/src/global_health_host.ihtml` | Added table style `border-collapse:separate;border-spacing:8px;` | | `centreon/www/widgets/global-health/src/global_health_service.ihtml` | Added table style `border-collapse:separate;border-spacing:8px;` | | `centreon/www/widgets/live-top10-cpu-usage/src/table_top10cpu.ihtml` | Introduced theme-based conditional color styling for progress bars and percentage spans | | `centreon/www/widgets/live-top10-memory-usage/src/table_top10memory.ihtml` | Implemented theme-based conditional color styling for progress bars and percentage spans |  Possibly related PRs  * **[enh(UI): Improves curves reading by changing their shade #4043](https://github.com/centreon/centreon/pull/4043)**: Modifies HTML structure of global health service widget table styling * **[chore(E2E) : Adding E2E tests to cover the new properties of the metrics graph  #4394](https://github.com/centreon/centreon/pull/4394)**: Updates style of Metrics Graph widgets * **[fix(Dashboards): Passive host are not taken into account on status chart/grid #5912](https://github.com/centreon/centreon/pull/5912)**: Addresses visibility issues in status chart/grid  Suggested labels `area/ui` Suggested reviewers  * Noha-ElAbrouki * Med1233  ---   Thank you for using CodeRabbit.

The CodeRabbit bot will not respond to your replies unless it is explicitly tagged.   * Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:   + `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`   + `@coderabbitai modularize this function.` * PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:   + `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`   + `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`   + `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`   + `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`   Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments. CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)  * `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR. * `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews. * `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository. * `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again. * `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR. * `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta)) * `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments. * `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository. * `@coderabbitai help` to get help.  Other keywords and placeholders  * Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed. * Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description. * Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.

🔇 Additional comments (3)
centreon/www/widgets/live-top10-cpu-usage/src/table\_top10cpu.ihtml (1)

`41-41`: **Uniformly handle text color for percentage.**

These lines consistently apply the theme-based text color through the parent `<div>`. This is good for maintainability since you only define color once. Ensure that the new color choice remains visible and accessible across different themes.

Also applies to: 45-45, 49-49

centreon/www/widgets/live-top10-memory-usage/src/table\_top10memory.ihtml (2)

`38-38`: **Check for color contrast compliance.**

You apply bold text styling and a color variable. Ensure the text remains legible against the progress bar. It might be worth verifying that there's satisfactory contrast for accessibility.

`41-41`: **Maintaining a unified styling approach for percentages.**
