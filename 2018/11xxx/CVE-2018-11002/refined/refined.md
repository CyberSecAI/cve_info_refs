{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Insecure file and directory Access Control Lists (ACLs) in the Pulse Secure Desktop Client.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The default installation grants BUILTIN\\Users effective Modify permissions to the \"C:\\ProgramData\\Pulse Secure\\Logging\" folder.",
      "The PulseSecureService, running as BUILTIN\\System, creates \"debuglog.log\" in the insecure directory with permissions for BUILTIN\\Everyone (F)."
    ],
    "impact": "Elevation of privilege by leveraging the vulnerability for DLL preloading in the PulseSecureService process, or to carry out DLL search order hijacking in other privileged processes, allowing an unprivileged attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An unprivileged attacker creates a directory junction and object manager symbolic link in the vulnerable logging directory.",
      "When the PulseSecureService starts, it creates or opens debuglog.log in the location specified by the symbolic link and directory junction, allowing the attacker to write arbitrary content to an arbitrary location."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be an unprivileged user on a system with the vulnerable Pulse Secure Desktop Client installed. They need to be able to create directory junctions and symbolic links.",
    "affected_versions": "Pulse Secure Desktop Client 5.3 (All versions) up to and including R6.0 build 1769",
    "remediation": "Upgrade to Pulse Secure Desktop Client 9.0Rx."
