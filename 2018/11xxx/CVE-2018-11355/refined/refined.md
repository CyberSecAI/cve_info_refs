    "source": "www.suse.com_77c635bb_20250126_113141.html",
    "Description": "In Wireshark 2.6.0, the RTCP dissector could crash. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-rtcp.c by avoiding a buffer overflow for packet status chunks.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A buffer overflow in the RTCP dissector when handling packet status chunks.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "Buffer overflow in the RTCP dissector.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Crash of Wireshark.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network injection of malformed packets or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker can inject malformed packets into the network being analyzed or provide a malformed packet trace file."
