Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-11713:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from WebKitGTK's handling of WebSocket connections when a system proxy is configured. Specifically, older versions of WebKitGTK were not using the system proxy settings when establishing WebSocket connections. This means that WebSocket traffic was not being routed through the proxy, potentially exposing users to security and privacy risks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Proxy Bypass:** WebSockets were not using system proxy settings.
- **Lack of Secure Connection:** This could lead to connections being established without the user's intended proxy, potentially exposing the user to malicious actors, or leaking sensitive data.
- **Inconsistent Network Behavior:** WebSockets were not behaving consistently with other network traffic in WebKitGTK.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not directly stated, this advisory is linked to other CVEs in WebKitGTK that can cause arbitrary code execution.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can also lead to a denial of service condition.
- **Security and privacy breach:** By bypassing the proxy, attackers could potentially intercept or modify WebSocket traffic.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Web Content:** A remote attacker could craft malicious web content that uses WebSockets, forcing the browser to make direct connections instead of using the proxy configuration. This means the attacker does not have to be on the local network.
- **Network Traffic Manipulation:** A man-in-the-middle attacker can intercept traffic from the unproxied WebSocket connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Position:** The attacker does not need to be on the same local network as the victim.
- **Ability to Host Malicious Content:** The attacker needs to host malicious content, or inject it into a website, that utilizes WebSockets.

**Additional Details:**

- The fix involves using `soup_session_connect_async()` to create WebSocket connections, ensuring that system proxy settings are respected.
- The vulnerability was present in `net-libs/webkit-gtk` versions before 2.20.4.
- The fix is also tied to a specific libsoup version.
- The bug report indicates the issue was also discussed in the context of WebRTC signaling.
- The issue was considered a "Critical" severity.
- The fix also involves adding new tests for the proxy settings and WebSocket connections.
