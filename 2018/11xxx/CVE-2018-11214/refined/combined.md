Package        : libjpeg-turbo
Version        : 1:1.3.1-12+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-3616 CVE-2018-1152 CVE-2018-11212 CVE-2018-11213
                 CVE-2018-11214
Debian Bug     : #819969 #902950 #902176

Several vulnerabilities have been resolved in libjpeg-turbo, Debian's
default JPEG implemenation.

CVE-2016-3616

    The cjpeg utility in libjpeg allowed remote attackers to cause a
    denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) or
    execute arbitrary code via a crafted file.

    This issue got fixed by the same patch that fixed CVE-2018-11213 and
    CVE-2018-11214.

CVE-2018-1152

    libjpeg-turbo has been found vulnerable to a denial of service
    vulnerability caused by a divide by zero when processing a crafted
    BMP image. The issue has been resolved by a boundary check.

CVE-2018-11212

    The alloc_sarray function in jmemmgr.c allowed remote attackers to
    cause a denial of service (divide-by-zero error) via a crafted file.

    The issue has been addressed by checking the image size when reading
    a targa file and throwing an error when image width or height is 0.

CVE-2018-11213
CVE-2018-11214

    The get_text_gray_row and get_text_rgb_row functions in rdppm.c both
    allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (Segmentation
    fault) via a crafted file.

    By checking the range of integer values in PPM text files and adding
    checks to ensure values are within the specified range, both issues

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1:1.3.1-12+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libjpeg-turbo packages.

# Multiple vulnerabilities in libjpeg-version 9a

We discovered multiple vulnerabilities in libjpeg-version 9a (git repository:<https://github.com/LuaDist/libjpeg>, Latest commit 6c0fcb8 on Nov 2, 2015).

## Floating point exception (jmemmgr.c:407) (**CVE-2018-11212**)

When testcase of **[libjpeg-v9a/Floating point exception/](https://github.com/ChijinZ/security_advisories/tree/master/libjpeg-v9a/Floating%20point%20exception)jmemmgr.c:407-**\* was input into **cjpeg** (command: *cjpeg testfile* ), a crash was triggered due to Floating point exception.

The problem seems like that an incorrect operation to float happened in line 407 of **jmemmgr.c** :

*ltemp = (MAX\_ALLOC\_CHUNK-SIZEOF(large\_pool\_hdr)) / ((long) samplesperrow \* SIZEOF(JSAMPLE));*

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)
