Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-11156:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `DREmailRelayHost` module. Specifically, the `hostname` parameter is used directly in the construction of a system command string without any validation or escaping, leading to command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection (CWE-78):** The primary weakness is the injection of arbitrary OS commands via the `hostname` parameter of the `DREmailRelayHost` module's `update` method. This occurs because the application does not neutralize special elements used in OS commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the Quest DR Series Disk Backup appliance with the privileges of the web application user.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** This initial command execution can be leveraged further to escalate privileges to root using other vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-11189, CVE-2018-11190, CVE-2018-11191, CVE-2018-11192, CVE-2018-11193, CVE-2018-11194) listed in the same advisory.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Complete control over the affected system can be achieved.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attack vector is the web interface of the Quest DR Series Disk Backup appliance.
*   **JSON-RPC API:** The specific attack vector involves sending a crafted JSON-RPC request to the `/ws/v1.0/jsonrpc` endpoint.
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a POST request with the malicious payload within the JSON body, targeting the `update` method of the `DREmailRelayHost` class, specifically injecting code into the `hostname` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable appliance.
*   **Authentication:**  The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit this specific vulnerability. However, an unauthenticated command injection vulnerability exists on the login page (CVE-2018-11143) that could be used to gain initial access, which would then allow this vulnerability to be exploited, or, an attacker could have already obtained valid credentials to log in to the web interface.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted JSON-RPC request to the `/ws/v1.0/jsonrpc` endpoint.
*   The `method` is set to `update`.
*   The `classname` parameter is set to `DREmailRelayHost`.
*   The `hostname` parameter contains a malicious command injection payload, such as `'; sleep 10; #'`
*   The server executes this command, resulting in arbitrary code execution.
