- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** A successful exploit enables the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser.
- **Cookie Theft:** The attacker can steal cookie-based authentication credentials, potentially leading to account hijacking.
- **Web Page Manipulation:** Attackers can modify the content of the web page, potentially leading to phishing attacks or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted URLs:** The attack vector is a specially crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code in the `category` or `app` parameters.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker would typically need to trick the victim into clicking on the malicious URL, often through social engineering tactics like embedding it in an email or other message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote and does not need any special access to the targeted server.
