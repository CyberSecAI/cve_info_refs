Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-11535

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `my_item_search` parameter of the `users.php` page, allowing for SQL injection or XPath injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection. The provided payloads demonstrate how an attacker can use the `extractvalue()` function within an SQL query to extract data by triggering errors. Although the direct query results are not returned, the errors reveal information about the database structure and data.
*   **XPath Injection:** The injection occurs within an XPath context, as the `extractvalue()` function is used to extract data from the result of a search.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, such as table names, column names, and other data.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** While not explicitly stated, successful information disclosure can pave the way for more advanced attacks or complete database compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a specially crafted POST request to the vulnerable `users.php` page.
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** The injection occurs through the `my_item_search` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application to send HTTP requests.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable parameter (`my_item_search`).
*   **Basic Understanding of SQL/XPath Injection:** An attacker needs to understand the basics of SQL and XPath injection to craft the malicious payloads.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit uses the `extractvalue()` function within a SQL query to cause errors which contain the extracted data. The payloads demonstrate how to exfiltrate table and column names.
*   The vulnerable code snippet is located in `/home/sitemakin/public_html/login-script-demo/includes/post_users.inc.php` on lines 33 and 34.
*   The application uses a PDO statement that executes a query with unsanitized user input.

The provided content gives detailed proof of concept information including request and response data. The `extractvalue` function is used within the injected SQL query to reveal information. Error messages expose table and column names.
