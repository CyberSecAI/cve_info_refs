Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-11702:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in FastStone Image Viewer. It occurs when the application attempts to process a malformed JPEG file. The application fails to handle the crafted file correctly, leading to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Buffer Overflow: The application fails to properly validate the size of the data being read from the malformed JPEG file before copying it into a buffer, causing a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The most direct impact of this vulnerability is a denial of service. Exploiting the buffer overflow results in an access violation, crashing the application (fsviewer.exe).
- Potential for other unspecified impacts:  The provided description mentions "possibly unspecified other impact" in addition to DoS, suggesting a possibility for other forms of exploitation, though this is not elaborated upon.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local: The attack vector is local. The attacker needs to provide a malformed JPEG file to the user.
- User Interaction Required: The user must open the crafted JPEG file using the vulnerable FastStone Image Viewer to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a specially crafted malformed JPEG file.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to open the crafted JPEG file using the vulnerable version of FastStone Image Viewer.

**Additional Details:**
