Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-11544:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insecure data storage within the "Ftp Server" Android application. Specifically, sensitive information, such as the FTP username and password, is stored in plain text within the application's shared preferences file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Data Storage:** The application stores the FTP username and password in plain text in the `com.theolivetree.ftpserver_preferences.xml` file located in `/data/data/com.theolivetree.ftpserver/shared_prefs/`.
*   **Lack of Encryption:** The sensitive credentials are not encrypted or protected in any way.
*   **Access Control Issues:** The shared preferences file is accessible to other applications or users with sufficient privileges on the device.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker who gains access to the vulnerable device's file system can retrieve the FTP credentials stored in plain text. This allows the attacker to:

*   Gain unauthorized access to the FTP server running on the user's device.
*   Read, modify, or delete files on the user's device via FTP.
*   Potentially use the compromised device as a stepping stone for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker who has physical access to the device or has gained remote access through other vulnerabilities can access the shared preferences file.
*   **Malicious Applications:** A malicious application installed on the same device may be able to access the shared preferences file due to insufficient access controls, especially on older versions of Android.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Device Access:** The attacker needs some form of access to the device's file system. This could be through physical access, remote access, or by a malicious app installed on the device.
*   **Android Knowledge:** Basic understanding of the Android file system and the location of application data is required.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided XML snippet shows that the username is stored in `prefUsername` and what appears to be a password in `prefUserpass`. It seems that the password here is not the actual password, but a username which is misleading. However, it is possible that a user could set a username as a password, this should still be considered a vulnerability.
* The pastebin content provides more detailed information regarding the location of the insecure data storage and provides a PoC showing the vulnerable settings.
* The version of the app vulnerable is specified as 1.32.
