DSA-2018-152: RSA® Authentication Manager Multiple Vulnerabilities

Dell EMC Identifier: DSA-2018-152

CVE Identifier:  CVE-2018-11073, CVE-2018-11074, CVE-2018-11075

Severity: Medium

Severity Rating:  View the details below for the individual CVSS Score for each CVE.

Affected Products:
•         RSA Authentication Manager versions prior to 8.3 Patch 3
RSA Authentication Manager web-tier server versions prior to 8.3 Patch 3
•         RSA Authentication Manager Language Pack versions prior to 8.3 Patch 3 (CVE-2018-11074 only)

Summary:
RSA Authentication Manager contains fixes for multiple security vulnerabilities that could potentially be exploited by
malicious users to compromise the affected system.

Details:
Multiple components within RSA Authentication Manager have been updated to address various vulnerabilities.

The components are updated for the following vulnerabilities:

•         Stored Cross-Site Scripting (CVE 2018-11073)
RSA Authentication Manager versions prior to 8.3 P3 contain a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in the
Operations Console. A malicious Operations Console administrator could exploit this vulnerability to store arbitrary
HTML or JavaScript code through the web interface. When other Operations Console administrators open the affected page,
the injected scripts could potentially be executed in their browser.
CVSSv3 Base Score: 6.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L)

•         DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2018-11074)
RSA Authentication Manager versions prior to 8.3 P3 are affected by a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability
which exists in its embedded MadCap Flare Help files. A remote unauthenticated attacker could potentially exploit this
vulnerability by tricking a victim application user to supply malicious HTML or JavaScript code to the browser DOM,
which code is then executed by the web browser in the context of the vulnerable web application
CVSSv3 Base Score 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

•         Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2018-11075)
RSA Authentication Manager versions prior to 8.3 P3 contain a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in a
Security Console page. A remote, unauthenticated malicious user, with the knowledge of a target user's anti-CSRF token,
could potentially exploit this vulnerability by tricking a victim Security Console user to supply malicious HTML or
JavaScript code to the vulnerable web application, which code is then executed by the victim's web browser in the
context of the vulnerable web application.
CVSSv3 Base SCore: 5.8 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L)

For more information about any of the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) mentioned here, consult the National
Vulnerability Database (NVD) at <http://nvd.nist.gov/home.cfm>. To search for a particular CVE, use the database's search
utility at <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/search>.

Recommendation:
The following RSA Authentication Manager releases contain resolutions to these vulnerabilities:
•         RSA Authentication Manager 8.3 Patch 3 and later
•         RSA Authentication Manager 8.3 Patch 3 and later web-tier server
•         RSA Authentication Manager Language Packs version 8.3 P3 and later (CVE-2018-11074)

RSA recommends all customers upgrade at the earliest opportunity.
