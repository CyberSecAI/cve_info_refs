Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2018-11075:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue within a Security Console page of RSA Authentication Manager.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- If exploited, the attacker can cause the victim's web browser to execute the injected malicious scripts. This can lead to various impacts, including:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of web pages
    - Stealing of sensitive information
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user

**Attack Vectors:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by tricking a victim Security Console user to supply malicious HTML or JavaScript code to the vulnerable web application. This requires knowledge of the victim user's anti-CSRF token.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be remote.
- The attacker needs to trick the victim into supplying the malicious code to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs prior knowledge of a target user's anti-CSRF token.
