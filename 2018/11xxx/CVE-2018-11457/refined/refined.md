- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The integrated web server on port 4842/tcp of the affected products could allow a remote attacker to execute code with privileged permissions by sending specially crafted network requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Code execution vulnerability due to specially crafted network requests targeting the web server.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to the compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the web server. The attacker can execute code with privileged permissions on the system.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can send specially crafted network requests to port 4842/tcp.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the affected devices and the 4842/tcp port must be manually opened in the firewall configuration of network port X130. No privileges or user interaction are required.
