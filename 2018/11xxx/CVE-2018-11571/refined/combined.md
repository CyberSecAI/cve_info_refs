## Description

[![@AnusyaAngamuthu](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36154722?u=01f7d673438c98e71e2bd6872866bc3d6288c7be&v=4&size=48)](/AnusyaAngamuthu)[AnusyaAngamuthu](https://github.com/AnusyaAngamuthu)opened [on May 30, 2018](https://github.com/ClipperCMS/ClipperCMS/issues/486#issue-327679180)

Clipper CMS 1.3.3 is vulnerable to session fixation attack.

1.The Session Fixation attack fixes an established session on the victim's browser, so the attack starts before the user logs in.

2.Session Fixation is an attack that permits an attacker to hijack a valid user session. The attack explores a limitation in the way the web application manages the session ID, more specifically the vulnerable web application.

3.When authenticating a user, it doesn’t assign a new session ID, making it possible to use an existent session ID.

4.The attack consists of obtaining a valid session ID (e.g. by connecting to the application), inducing a user to authenticate himself with that session ID, and then hijacking the user validated session by the knowledge of the used session ID. The attacker has to provide a legitimate Web application session ID and try to make the victim's browser use it.

Let's see the session values before login

Session Values after Login

[![session afterlogin2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36154722/40716363-5d5e7f8c-6426-11e8-9e7d-aaf73bb419a5.PNG)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36154722/40716363-5d5e7f8c-6426-11e8-9e7d-aaf73bb419a5.PNG)

Mitigation:

1.Session ID must be renewed after authentication (i.e) session must be different before authentication and after authentication.

2.The application should not accept user supplied cookie value (i.e)session value.
