The content is related to CVE-2018-11571.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application does not assign a new session ID upon successful user authentication. It reuses the existing session ID, leading to session fixation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Session Fixation vulnerability: The application does not regenerate the session ID upon user login.
- Accepting user-supplied session cookie values: The application does not validate or reject user-supplied session ID values.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can hijack a valid user session after the user authenticates. This would allow the attacker to perform actions as the legitimate user, gaining unauthorized access to the application and resources.

**Attack vectors:**
1. Attacker obtains a valid session ID by connecting to the application.
2. The attacker induces a user to authenticate using the attacker's previously obtained session ID.
3. The attacker uses the stolen session ID to hijack the user's validated session.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to access the vulnerable web application.
- The attacker must be able to induce the victim to authenticate using a specific session ID (e.g., by sending a crafted link).
- The attacker must be able to obtain a valid session ID from the application.
