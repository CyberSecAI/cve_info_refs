  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Inadequate input filtering",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Multiple XSS vulnerabilities",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Users of the default Administrator user group could perform XSS attacks. Other XSS vulnerabilities also exist due to inadequate input filtering.",
  "Attack vectors": "Inadequate input filtering leading to XSS.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code that bypasses the input filtering. In the case of the Administrator user group, the default filtering settings are insufficient to prevent XSS. Specifics on how to inject the code are not given."
