    "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, leading to various security issues, such as website defacement, data breaches, or complete server compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "Malicious file upload"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to upload files to the Joomla application. This could be through a vulnerable extension or a vulnerability in Joomla core."
