{
  "cve_id": "CVE-2018-11477",
  "description": "The data packets which are sent between the App and the OBD dongle are not encrypted. The combination of this vulnerability with the lack of a wireless network protection exposes all transferred car data to the public.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Lack of encryption in data transfer between the app and OBD dongle.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unencrypted data transmission.",
      "Lack of wireless network protection."
    ],
    "impact": "Exposure of all transferred car data to the public. Potential to intercept sensitive car information. This can be combined with other vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-11476 and CVE-2018-11478) to send arbitrary messages to the car's communication bus, potentially taking over safety-critical car functions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Wireless network (WLAN) interception.",
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on the unencrypted wireless network."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker within range of the device's unprotected WiFi network can intercept the unencrypted communication between the app and the OBD dongle."
