Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-11712:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced by commit [r228088](https://commits.webkit.org/r228088) which modified `SocketStreamHandleImplSoup` to use `soup_session_connect_async()`. This change unintentionally disabled certificate verification for secure WebSocket connections because it disabled `SOUP_SESSION_SSL_STRICT`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing TLS Certificate Verification:** The core issue is that TLS certificate verification was not being performed for secure WebSocket connections due to the use of `soup_session_connect_async()` and the disabling of `SOUP_SESSION_SSL_STRICT`. This means the client would accept any certificate from the server.
*   **Incorrect TLS Error Handling**: The code was also incorrectly handling TLS errors, ignoring settings from `webkit_web_context_set_tls_errors_policy()` and certificate overrides set with `webkit_web_context_allow_tls_certificate_for_host()`. Instead, it was relying on the `DeprecatedGlobalSettings::allowsAnySSLCertificate` setting, which was only meant for testing purposes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A remote attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack by presenting a malicious certificate to the client during a WebSocket connection. This could allow the attacker to intercept and modify data transmitted over the WebSocket, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** A network-based attack is required where an attacker can intercept the WebSocket connection between the client and server.
*   **Malicious Server:** The attacker would need to control or impersonate the server the client is attempting to connect to via a WebSocket.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM):** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and modify network traffic between the client and server.
*   **Malicious Certificate:** The attacker needs to have a certificate that the client would normally reject, but due to the vulnerability, the client will accept.
*   **Target User Action:** The victim needs to initiate a WebSocket connection to the malicious server controlled by the attacker.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is a regression introduced by a previous change related to proxy settings for WebSockets.
*   The fix involves re-enabling TLS certificate verification and correctly handling TLS errors through `SoupNetworkSession::checkTLSErrors()` and ensuring the use of  `SoupSessionConnectProgressCallback` for the `accept-certificate` signal of `GTlsConnection`
* The fix involves adding a public url getter in `SocketStreamHandleImpl.h` and modifying `SocketStreamHandleImplSoup.cpp` to use `SoupNetworkSession::checkTLSErrors` to decide whether to accept the certificate, and it modifies `Tools/TestWebKitAPI/Tests/WebKitGLib/TestSSL.cpp` to test the fix.
