{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Quest DR Series Disk Backup software contains multiple command injection vulnerabilities due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input in various API endpoints. Specifically, request parameters are used to construct shell commands without proper escaping or sanitization, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary system commands.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command [CWE-78]",
        "Execution with Unnecessary Privileges [CWE-250]"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands with root privileges on the affected system, leading to complete compromise of the device. This includes the ability to read or modify sensitive data, disrupt services, or use the device as a foothold for further attacks on the network.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerabilities are primarily exposed through the web interface's JSON-RPC API. Attackers can send specially crafted requests to the vulnerable endpoints, injecting malicious code into various request parameters.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An unauthenticated attacker can exploit the login vulnerability. For other vulnerabilities, the attacker needs to be authenticated to the web application. After initial access via command injection, the attacker can easily gain root privileges due to unnecessary sudo access for webadmin user."
