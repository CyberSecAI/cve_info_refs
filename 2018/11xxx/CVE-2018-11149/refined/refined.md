```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The Quest DR Series Disk Backup software contains multiple command injection vulnerabilities due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input in various JSON-RPC API methods. Specifically, the 'setCleaner' method within the DRSchedules class is vulnerable, where the 'day' parameter is used unsafely in the construction of a command string.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (CWE-78)
- Execution with Unnecessary Privileges (CWE-250)

Impact of exploitation:
Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the appliance with root permissions. This can lead to complete compromise of the affected system, including data breaches, denial of service, and other malicious activities.

Attack vectors:
The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted JSON-RPC request to the affected endpoint. In this case, the 'setCleaner' method of the 'DRSchedules' class is targeted. The 'day' parameter is injected with shell metacharacters and commands.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs network access to the appliance's web interface.
- The attacker needs to craft a JSON-RPC request with a malicious payload in the 'day' parameter of the 'setCleaner' method.
- The attacker requires a valid session cookie for successful exploitation. However, one command injection vulnerability exists which does not require authentication (CVE-2018-11143) and can be used to gain initial access.
