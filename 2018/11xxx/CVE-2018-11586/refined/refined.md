{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a weakly configured XML parser in SearchBlox, which processes XML input containing references to external entities.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "XML External Entity (XXE) injection vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can exploit the XXE vulnerability to read arbitrary files from the server, conduct server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks, and potentially other system impacts such as denial of service or port scanning.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through sending a crafted XML request to the `/searchblox/api/rest/status` endpoint, which includes a malicious DTD referencing an external entity.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can be remote and unauthenticated. They need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint."
