{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command. The Quest DR Series Disk Backup software's JSON-RPC API fails to sanitize user-supplied input, allowing command injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command",
     "CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary system commands on the appliance with root permissions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The primary attack vector is through the exposed JSON-RPC API, where various methods accept user-supplied parameters that are not properly sanitized before being used in OS commands. Specifically, the 'domain' parameter in the 'join' method within the 'ActiveDirectoryService' module is vulnerable to command injection.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can be unauthenticated for the 'Logon' method. For all other methods, the attacker needs to be authenticated with a valid session token to exploit the command injection vulnerabilities."
