{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing OS commands, leading to command injection vulnerabilities.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command [CWE-78]",
    "Execution with Unnecessary Privileges [CWE-250]"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the appliance with root privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerabilities are exposed through the web interface's JSON-RPC API. Attackers can send crafted JSON-RPC requests to trigger command injection.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker can exploit some command injection vulnerabilities without authentication. Other command injection and all privilege escalation vulnerabilities require a valid authentication token."
