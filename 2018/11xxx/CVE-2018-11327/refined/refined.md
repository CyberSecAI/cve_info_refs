- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by any user (including non-logged-in users) who can access the component where the tag names are being disclosed. The specific attack vector within the application is not detailed but it indicates a lack of access control.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to access the Joomla! site where the tags are being displayed. No special permissions are needed to access the vulnerable information.
