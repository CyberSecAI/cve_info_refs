{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command. User-supplied input is not sanitized when constructing shell commands, leading to command injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command",
    "CWE-250 Execution with Unnecessary Privileges"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution on the appliance with root privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Unauthenticated command injection via the 'Password' parameter of the 'Logon' method.",
     "Authenticated command injection through various methods of the JSON-RPC API, including user management, container management, scheduling, licensing, email relay settings, Active Directory integration, storage management, diagnostics, replication, hostname configuration, email alerts, network interfaces, encryption settings, startup settings, cloud portal, customer portal, DNS settings, usage monitoring, support portal, date/time settings, and global view management."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "For unauthenticated command injection, no prior authentication is needed. For authenticated command injection, a valid session token is required. For privilege escalation, initial code execution as the web server user (webadmin) is needed. This can be achieved through command injection vulnerabilities."
