Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-11651:

**Verification:**

The provided content directly references the fix for CVE-2018-11651. The Graylog release notes for version 2.4.4 explicitly mention: "Fix (XSS) security issue with unescaped text in notification and dashboard names. [Graylog2/graylog2-server#4727](https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog2-server/pull/4727) [Graylog2/graylog2-server#4739](https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog2-server/pull/4739)". This confirms that the content is related to the specified CVE.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization/escaping of user-provided text used in notification and dashboard names within the Graylog application. This allows for the injection of malicious code.
*   **Weaknesses:** The core weakness is the failure to encode or escape user-supplied input (specifically, dashboard and notification names) before rendering it in the user interface. This allows for the possibility of injecting client-side scripting code.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to perform a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack. This could result in:
    *   **Session hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies to gain unauthorized access to accounts.
    *   **Malware delivery:** Injecting malicious scripts that redirect users to malware download pages or perform other malicious activities.
    *   **Phishing attacks:** Displaying fake login prompts or other forms to steal credentials.
    *   **Defacement:** Changing the appearance or content of the Graylog web interface.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The primary attack vector is through the user interface of the Graylog application itself. An attacker would need to:
    1.  Craft a malicious payload containing JavaScript or other client-side code.
    2.  Inject this payload into the "notification and dashboard names".
    3.  Cause a legitimate user to view the dashboard or notification where the malicious script is injected.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of Graylog, with the ability to create or modify dashboards or notifications.
    *   No further privileges are necessary to exploit the vulnerability.
    *   The attacker needs a victim to view the injected XSS payload within the affected page.

**Additional Notes**

* The github content shows a pull request that handles the rendering of the dashboard title, and mentions "avoiding the use of jquery and specially `.html`". The `.html` function is often an entrypoint for XSS vulnerabilities.
* The content also references a backport to version 2.4, indicating the vulnerability affected that version as well.

In summary, CVE-2018-11651 is an XSS vulnerability caused by improperly sanitized text in Graylog notification and dashboard names. An authenticated attacker can inject client-side code to perform malicious actions on other users' browsers.
