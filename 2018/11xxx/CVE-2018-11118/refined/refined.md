      "is_related": true,
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of URLs within external feed items in ILIAS. The `secureString` function was modified to add a `target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"` attribute to `<a>` tags, however, the URL itself was not being sanitized before being placed into the href.",
        "vulnerabilities": [
          "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code through crafted URLs in external feed items. This code could be executed in the context of a user's browser session when they view the feed, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
        "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through manipulating the URL within an external RSS feed. The feed item is then parsed and displayed by the ILIAS platform.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to inject a crafted URL into an external RSS feed that is consumed by an ILIAS system. The attacker's position is external."
