Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-11804:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-11804

**Description:**

The vulnerability resides in the Apache Spark build process. Specifically, the `build/mvn` script downloads and runs a zinc server to speed up compilation. This zinc server, by default, accepts connections from external hosts. A specially crafted request to this zinc server could expose information from files readable by the developer account running the build process.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The `build/mvn` script uses a zinc server that, by default, listens on all interfaces, making it accessible from external hosts.
- Lack of proper access control and input validation in the zinc server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Disclosure:**  A malicious actor could send specially crafted requests to the zinc server and obtain access to information contained within files readable by the user running the `build/mvn` script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Exposure:** Sensitive information such as source code, configuration files, or build artifacts from the developer machine could be leaked to an attacker.
- Potential for further attacks if leaked information is valuable.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the developer's machine running the zinc server.
- **Malicious Request:** The attacker must craft a specific request that exploits the zinc server to reveal file content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network proximity:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the developer's machine.
- **Knowledge of zinc protocol:** The attacker requires knowledge of the zinc server's protocol to craft a malicious request.

**Additional Notes**
- This vulnerability does not impact Spark end users. Only developers compiling Spark from the source code using the `build/mvn` script are affected.
- The provided mitigation includes:
   - Avoiding the use of `build/mvn` and running a local Maven command instead.
   -  Updating actively developed branches as mitigations were patched in the `build/mvn` script.
   - Specifying `"-server 127.0.0.1"` and `"-idle-timeout 30m"` when running zinc separately to restrict access to localhost and limit the idle timeout, respectively.
