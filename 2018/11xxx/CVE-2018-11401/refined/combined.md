Title

Severity

Replay Attack in SimpliSafe Alarm System

High

Discovered by

Dr. Andrew Zonenberg

Advisory Date

17 February 2016

Affected Products

1.  SimpliSafe home burglar/fire alarm systems

Overview

SimpliSafe manufactures a line of wireless alarm systems and sensors targeted at home
users, and provides a monitoring service to contact emergency services if an alarm is
triggered. The service is marketed as an easy-to-install, more secure alternative to other
alarm systems which require running wires throughout the house.

However, the radio interface is not encrypted and does not use “rolling codes,” nonces, two-
way handshakes, or other techniques to prevent transmissions from being recorded and
reused. An attacker who is able to intercept the radio signals between the keypad and base
station can record and re-play the signal in order to turn off the alarm at a time of his choice
in the future.

Technical Details

The keypad and sensors communicate with the base station in cleartext via a 433 MHz
digital radio. An attacker who is within radio range of the alarm system can record these
packets, examine the header to determine the type of message, and then play it back on
demand to disable the alarm, trigger false alarms, and otherwise take full control of the
system. The transmitter on the keypad circuit board and receiver on the base station can be
combined with an off-the-shelf microcontroller board to implement this attack at minimal
cost (less than $250 in parts and a few hundred lines of code).

This attack requires physical proximity to the target system and cannot be performed over
the Internet. However, since a criminal must obviously enter the protected property in order
to burglarize it, physical proximity does not significantly increase the difficulty of the attack.

Fixes

SimpliSafe should release new firmware which adds cryptographic protections to prevent
packets from being recorded and replayed. Unfortunately it appears that the deployed
systems use one-time-programmable microcontrollers, which means that field updating of

existing systems is not possible. All existing keypads and base stations will need to be
replaced to fix the vulnerability.

Mitigation

By changing PINs often the useful lifetime of a captured PIN can be reduced, but this does
not stop an attacker from intercepting the new PIN after the change.

are not affected by the vulnerabilities listed in this advisory

Overview
In March 2018, known vulnerabilities in SimpliSafe Original Sensors, Keypad, and Base Station,
which were first reported in February 2016 by Dr. Andrew Zonenberg (IOActive), and then by
Michael Ossmann (Great Scott Gadgets), were re-submitted to SimpliSafe by Adam Callis.  This
advisory integrates Mr. Callis’ findings with respect to the SimpliSafe Original Home Security
System with prior research, describes the validation of those findings performed by a specialist
hardware and wireless/RF security research team, enumerates affected products, and describes
mitigation recommendations for customers of the SimpliSafe Original Home Security System.

Importantly, this advisory updates SimpliSafe’s suggested mitigations from its initial response in
February 2016.  While Mr. Callis reported no new vulnerabilities and did not demonstrate
attacks of significantly lesser complexity or greater efficacy, SimpliSafe acknowledges that as
time and technology progress, attacks against exposures such as those in the SimpliSafe
3
Original system may tend to become more practical.

Though this is an increasingly accessible area of security research, SimpliSafe is not aware of
customers compromised using the methods described in this advisory. Additionally, even
though these vulnerabilities are present in other similar home security products, Simplisafe is
unaware of any compromise against similar home security products using these methods.

SimpliSafe discontinued manufacturing the SimpliSafe Original Home Security System in 2017
and removed the product from prominent display on its website. More recently, SimpliSafe
made the decision to offer a

affected customers.

SimpliSafe takes a proactive approach to security and devotes extensive engineering and
testing resources, using both internal and external expertise, to secure its products using
industry best practices. The All New SimpliSafe home security system and SimpliCam security
camera are not affected by the vulnerabilities listed in this advisory; this has been validated by
external security experts.

Description
Unencrypted radio frequency (RF) transmissions in SimpliSafe Original Home Security Systems
are susceptible to traffic capture and replay by a physically proximate (15-30m), but
unauthenticated attacker using a software-defined radio (SDR) dongle loaded with
publicly-available code. The equipment required to exploit this vulnerability are relatively
low-cost and are made generally available to the public for sale. This attack was validated by
SimpliSafe through a third-party security firm.

(Scenario 1)

Commands entered on the keypad, including ARM, DISARM, TEST MODE, and the PIN code,
may be captured by a proximate attacker, as they are transmitted unencrypted to the Base
Station of the SimpliSafe Original Home Security System. ARM, DISARM, and PANIC commands
transmitted from the Keychain Remote to the Base Station of the SimpliSafe Original home
security system, and status information (ACTIVE/OPEN, INACTIVE/CLOSED) transmitted from
Entry, Motion, and Water Detector Sensors to the Base Station of the SimpliSafe Original Home
Security System, may likewise be captured using similar procedures. Keypad and Sensor serial
numbers of the SimpliSafe Original Home Security System are also obtainable via this method.
This attack was validated by SimpliSafe through a third-party security firm.

(Scenario 1)

Transmissions between the Keypad, Keychain Remote, Sensors, and Base Station of the
SimpliSafe Original Home Security System are susceptible to interference by radio transmissions
over the same frequencies. While an attacker could potentially leverage this attack to make the
SimpliSafe Original Home Security System susceptible to being disabled, it is theoretically
possible (though unlikely) that legitimate transmissions from amateur radio operators could
also have a disruptive effect if sufficiently proximate to a system. However, the SimpliSafe
Original Home Security System does attempt to mitigate interference by resending messages.
Additionally, the Base Station of the SimpliSafe Original Home Security System can provide
notification when RF ‘noise’ impacts its ability to ‘hear’ transmissions from Sensors or other
components of the SimpliSafe Original Home Security System, though this is not enabled by
default. This attack was validated by SimpliSafe through a third-party security firm.

(Scenario 2)

It is additionally possible to physically disarm the SimpliSafe Original Home Security System by
removing the battery and disconnecting external power if the attacker has access to the Base
Station during the “entry delay” period (default is 30 seconds, but timing is configurable). The
Base Station of the SimpliSafe Original Home Security System does not alert the system owner
to physical tampering.

Initial Guidance

SimpliSafe Original Home Security System
Updated Guidance

Change your PIN code regularly. This is a
good security practice regardless.

Change your PIN code if you know or suspect
it has been compromised. Choose a robust
but memorable PIN and keep it safe. Avoid
sequential, quad, birth year, and other
common PIN formulations (e.g., 4567, 3333,
1989).

Frequent PIN code changes theoretically
shorten the period of time during which it
may be captured or observed, then replayed
or entered manually to a targeted system’s
keypad. However, a manual PIN change
would only protect against these attacks if it
occurred in the interval between PIN capture
(which is not detectable) and replay or entry
into a target system.

In line with current guidelines published by
the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST), SimpliSafe does not
recommend that customers rotate PIN codes
in the absence of evidence or suspicion of
7
compromise.

Monitor notifications of your alarm being
disarmed for any unexpected activity.

Monitor notifications of your alarm being

While remaining alert and observant is
excellent practice, excessive vigilance confers
marginal benefit. Given more expensive and
more powerful equipment than that used to
validate attacks described in this advisory,
Great Scott Gadgets estimated a 1.5km range
for viable PIN replay attacks.  In contrast, the
verified attack range of ~15m still assumes
optimal conditions and a minimum of
interference from building structures, terrain,
trees, etc.

Customers of the SimpliSafe Original Home
Security System in higher population density
areas are not expected to observe persons
and equipment inside of neighboring
apartments, condos, or houses. Likewise,
customers in rural areas are not expected to
maintain an exclusion zone around their
property.

Additionally, SimpliSafe recommends keeping
the Base Station out of view so that it cannot
be easily found and disabled by an attacker in
the home.  Customers can also either
configure their “entry delay” to instantly
trigger an alarm, or call SimpliSafe’s customer
support to decrease their “entry delay” to
less than 30 seconds.

Ossmann (Great Scott Gadgets) and rtl_433 support by Adam Callis.

9 ‘On Hoermann BiSecur devices before 2018, a vulnerability can be exploited by recording a single radio
transmission. An attacker can intercept an arbitrary radio frame exchanged between a BiSecur transmitter and a
receiver to obtain the encrypted packet and the 32-bit serial number. The interception of the one-time pairing
process is specifically not required. Due to use of AES-128 with an initial static random value and static data vector
(all of this static information is the same across different customers' installations), the attacker can easily derive
the utilized encryption key and decrypt the intercepted packet. The key can be verified by decrypting the
intercepted packet and checking for known plaintext. Subsequently, an attacker can create arbitrary radio frames
with the correct encryption key to control BiSecur garage and entrance gate operators and possibly other BiSecur
systems as well ("wireless cloning"). To conduct the attack, a low cost Software Defined Radio (SDR) is sufficient.
This affects Hoermann Hand Transmitter HS5-868-BS, HSE1-868-BS, and HSE2-868-BS devices.’
