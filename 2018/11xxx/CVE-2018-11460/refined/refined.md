- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A local attacker with elevated user privileges (manufact) can modify a CRAMFS archive. Upon reboot, the system loads the modified CRAMFS file, executing attacker-controlled code with root privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Modification of CRAMFS archive leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system by gaining root access and executing arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the affected system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access to the system and must have elevated user privileges (manufact). No user interaction is needed for the exploit.
