• Restrict system access to authorized personnel and follow a least privilege approach

• Apply cell protection concept

• Use VPN for protecting network communication between cells

• Apply Defense-in-Depth

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SINUMERIK CNC offers automation solutions for the shop ﬂoor, job shops and large serial production
environments.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.0
(CVSS v3.0) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-11457

The integrated web server on port 4842/tcp of the affected products could allow a remote attacker to
execute code with privileged permissions on the system by sending specially crafted network requests
to port 4842/tcp.

Please note that this vulnerability is only exploitable if port 4842/tcp is manually opened in the ﬁrewall
conﬁguration of network port X130.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to the affected
devices on port 4842/tcp. Successful exploitation requires no privileges and no user interaction. The
vulnerability could allow an attacker to compromise conﬁdentiality, integrity and availability of the web
server.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.
