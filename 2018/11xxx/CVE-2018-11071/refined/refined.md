- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by the affected systems not properly handling specially crafted input data, leading to a crash of the `isi_drive_d` process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of input data leading to a remote process crash.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can crash the `isi_drive_d` process. The process will be restarted after crashing.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending specially crafted input data to the affected system over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be unauthenticated and needs network access to the affected system.
