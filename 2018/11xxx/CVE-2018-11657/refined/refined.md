**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an infinite loop in the `LoadGif` function within the `ngiflib.c` file, specifically at line 669. The issue arises because the code lacks a break statement in a switch case when the "id" does not match any defined cases.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
An infinite loop vulnerability exists in the `LoadGif` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A specially crafted GIF file can trigger the infinite loop, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a malicious GIF file specifically crafted to trigger the problematic code path in the `LoadGif` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious GIF file to the vulnerable application or service.
