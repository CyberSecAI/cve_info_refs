  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "When a Solr node receives a request for a collection it does not host, it proxies the request to a relevant node. However, Solr bypasses all authorization settings for these proxied requests.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Authorization bypass"
    ],
    "impact": "Unauthorized access to Solr collections, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation.",
     "attack_vectors": "A request made to a Solr node for a collection it doesn't host.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send requests to a Solr node. No specific permissions or user roles are required for the bypass to occur."
