## Description

[![@zentron](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1830666?u=5b94969988f5a34651eb2eda034938d018f6ff43&v=4&size=48)](/zentron)[zentron](https://github.com/zentron)opened [on May 21, 2018](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Issues/issues/4578#issue-324792730)

When an Azure Target is involved in a deployment, the sensitive account variables linked to it are not obfuscated in the logs.

## Steps to reproduce

* Create an `Azure Subscription` account
* Create an `Azure WebApp` target that uses the previously created account
* Create a project with a `Deploy Azure WebApp` step that uses the same role as the previously created target.
* Add the debugging variable `OctopusPrintVariables` to the project.
* Create and deploy release
* View the deployment log

**What you expect to see**

The printed log should show `*******` as the value of the variable `Octopus.Action.Azure.Password`

**What you see instead**

The actual value of the azure password is printed to the logs

## Octopus releases with this regression bug

This issue came about with a changed execution pipeline which was available from `2018.3.8` however this code path that led to this bug would not have been commonly executed until the Azure targets introduced in `2018.5.0`

## CVE

`CVE-2018-11320`
