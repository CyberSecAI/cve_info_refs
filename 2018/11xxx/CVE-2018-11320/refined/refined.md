Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-11320:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a regression bug introduced due to a change in the execution pipeline. This change caused sensitive account variables associated with Azure Targets to be logged in plain text during deployments. Specifically, the password for Azure accounts were not being obfuscated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:**  The primary weakness is the exposure of sensitive information (Azure account passwords) in deployment logs.
- **Lack of Proper Obfuscation:** The system failed to properly obfuscate sensitive variables when an Azure Target is involved in a deployment.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential Disclosure:** Attackers with access to deployment logs could obtain sensitive Azure account credentials.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Compromised credentials could lead to unauthorized access to Azure resources and potential data breaches.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Access to Deployment Logs:**  Attackers would need access to the deployment logs generated by the Octopus Deploy system. This could be achieved through unauthorized access to the deployment platform or by compromising systems where logs are stored.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Log Access:** Attackers need the ability to view or obtain deployment logs.
- **Knowledge of Target:** Attackers need some knowledge about the Octopus Deploy system configuration in order to identify potentially exposed Azure credentials.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in Octopus Deploy version `2018.3.8` due to a changed execution pipeline.
- The issue became more prominent with the introduction of Azure targets in `2018.5.0`.
- The issue is identified as a regression bug, implying that it was fixed previously but reintroduced in a later release.
