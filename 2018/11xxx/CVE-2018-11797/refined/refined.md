Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-11797:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an unbounded computation within the parser of the Apache PDFBox library. Specifically, a crafted PDF file can trigger an extremely long-running process when parsing the page tree, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is the lack of proper bounds checking or resource limits within the PDF parsing logic, allowing an attacker-controlled input (a crafted PDF) to exhaust computational resources. This results in unbounded computation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit of this vulnerability leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, making the PDFBox library or applications that use it unresponsive. This can manifest as a crash, hang, or unresponsiveness to further requests.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the processing of a malicious PDF file. An attacker can craft a PDF that triggers the unbounded computation during the parsing of its page tree.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted PDF file to an application or service that uses the vulnerable version of the PDFBox library. No special privileges are required to trigger this vulnerability, just the ability to get the target to process the malicious PDF.

**Additional Notes:**
The provided content includes information related to the fix in Fedora and Debian, indicating the vulnerability was addressed by updating to PDFBox version 2.0.16. The Red Hat Bugzilla entries also corroborate this vulnerability by detailing its impact and the fix versions.
