The provided document contains information about CVE-2018-11053.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The iDRAC Service Module (iSM) versions 3.0.1, 3.0.2, 3.1.0, and 3.2.0, when started, incorrectly change the default file permission of the host's `/etc/hosts` file to world writable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper file permissions on `/etc/hosts` file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious low-privileged operating system user or process could modify the `/etc/hosts` file.
- This modification could potentially redirect network traffic from the intended destination to sites hosting malicious or unwanted content.
- This could lead to man-in-the-middle attacks or redirect users to malicious resources.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access to the affected operating system.
- Exploitation can be performed by a malicious low-privileged user or process running on the host OS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the affected system and the ability to execute commands/processes.
- No special privileges are needed; the vulnerability is exploitable by a low-privileged user.
