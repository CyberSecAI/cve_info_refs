Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-11082:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of brute-force protection on Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) codes within the User Account and Authentication (UAA) component of Cloud Foundry.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **MFA Brute-Force:** The UAA did not implement proper rate limiting or lockout mechanisms for failed MFA code attempts. This allowed an attacker to repeatedly try different MFA codes until a valid one was found.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account Takeover:** An attacker with a valid username and password for a user account could successfully bypass MFA by brute-forcing the MFA code, gaining full access to the compromised account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Unauthenticated Access:** A remote attacker, without prior access to the system or a specific session, could exploit this vulnerability.
- **Valid Credentials Required:** The attacker must possess valid username and password credentials for a target user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the UAA service.
- The attacker needs to have obtained valid username and password credentials for a user in the targeted system.

**Additional Details:**
- This issue is rated as having a medium severity.
- The vulnerability was fixed in uaa-release version 61.0 and uaa version 4.20.0.
