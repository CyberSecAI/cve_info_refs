{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in system commands. This results in command injection vulnerabilities.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command [CWE-78]",
	"Execution with Unnecessary Privileges [CWE-250]"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary system commands on the appliance with root permissions, leading to complete system compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerabilities are accessed through the web interface's JSON-RPC API. Attackers send crafted requests to various API methods with malicious payloads embedded in parameters.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker can exploit an unauthenticated command injection vulnerability on the login page or authenticate to the web interface and use other command injection vulnerabilities. Additionally, several privilege escalation vulnerabilities are also present which can be used after gaining initial access."
