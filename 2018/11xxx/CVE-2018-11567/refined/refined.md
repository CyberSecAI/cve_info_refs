Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Amazon Alexa skills are designed, specifically how developers can control session behavior and prompts. By exploiting the flexibility in how skills can interact with the Echo device, researchers were able to create a malicious skill that could eavesdrop on users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Unrestricted Session Length:** The "shouldEndSession" parameter, designed to control whether a skill's session ends after a user request, could be set to "false" indefinitely, keeping the session open beyond its intended use.
2.  **Empty Prompts:** The "reprompt" parameter, used to prompt a user for further input, could be set to have empty output speech, which would keep the session active without the user being aware that Alexa is still listening.
3.  **Arbitrary Transcription:** While skills are meant to transcribe specific commands, the researchers were able to program their skill to transcribe any arbitrary words and sentences spoken by the user. This allowed the skill to capture spoken words beyond the expected commands.
4.  **Input Slot Manipulation:** By using a custom-type input slot with a gibberish word, the researchers were able to effectively capture any spoken sentence as input to the skill.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Eavesdropping:** Attackers could listen to conversations within earshot of the Echo device, capturing a transcription of the spoken words.
*   **Privacy Violation:** Users' private conversations could be exposed to the developers of the malicious skill.
*   **Potential Data Leakage:** The transcribed conversations could be logged externally and accessible to the attackers.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Skill Upload:** Attackers would create a malicious Alexa skill and upload it to the Amazon Skill Store.
*   **Social Engineering:** Users would need to be tricked or encouraged into enabling the malicious skill.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Alexa Developer Account:** Attackers would need an Amazon developer account to create and upload skills.
*   **Skill Development Expertise:** The attackers need the ability to design a skill that can manipulate the session and transcription functionalities.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker requires the user to activate and interact with the malicious skill.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The attack did not require any hacking or changes to the Amazon Echo system itself but rather exploited the design of the system.
*   The exploitation provides text transcriptions and not audio recordings
*   Amazon has since put mitigations in place, including better control over empty prompts and screening for eavesdropping functionality.
