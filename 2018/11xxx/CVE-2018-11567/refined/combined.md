Amazon Echo

Alexa Leveraged as a Silent
Eavesdropper

Alexa skills can be developed in different languages (C#, Java, JavaScript) using the Alexa Skill
Kit (Alexa SDK - https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit). Skills can integrate with the
AWS-Lambda function.

Each developed skill includes a group of ‘intents’. Each ‘intent’ is a use-case for a possible

command the user can activate within this skill - https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-

skills/use-the-skill-builder-beta-to-defineintents-slots-and-dialogs.html

The skill is activated by an invocation word as defined in the skill setting:

The Echo is continuously listening for the user’s voice. So when the user says "Alexa, open

calculator", the calculator skill is initialized and the API\Lambda-function that's associated with the

skill receives a launchrequest as an input.

Within the skill, intents are activated by the sample utterances defined for each intent: https://

developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/custom-interaction-model-reference.html#sample-
utterancespecification There are built-in intents: Cancel-Intent, Help-Intent, Stop-Intent (which can
be overwritten) and a developer can create his/her own intent for the skill functionalities.

The sample utterances for each intent are a combination of static keywords and input slots. The

best practice is to use a built-in-type for each input slot (or a well-defined custom-type wish list of

potential inputs), thus voice recognition will be optimized for the specific needs of the intents.

Although it is not considered a best-practice, a custom-type of input slot can contain a single

value (having no values is not possible) which is a gibberish word that is unlikely to be spoken, and

the sample utterances of an intent includes a combination of slots of this type only without any

static words:

www.checkmarx.com

The result of this intent configuration shows

that every sentence spoken by the user (in the

context of the skill) will be captured by one of

the sample utterances of this intent. Since the

word is very likely to be far from the gibberish

word, Alexa’s default built-in dictionary

vocabulary will be used and the words will be

dictated to the input slots in the

"IntentRequest" as plain text (slot per word).

If the skill is implemented by a Lambda

function, the intent request (including the input

slot values, containing the dictation of the

spoken words) will be an input parameter of the

function which should process it for the skill and

intent specific needs – the input will include

only text, not the recorded voice itself.

The input slot should be processed within the function in order to build an appropriate

SkillResponse. That's the return by the function to Alexa (and spoken by the Echo device).

https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/request-and-response-json-reference.html

Within a valid skill with legitimate intent functionality (for example a calculator skill that calculates

math actions according to user input), the input can be captured to an external log, accessible to

the skill developer. In the case of a "RecorderIntent" as described above, this input will be a

dictation of what was said within the context of the skill (since the wide-range utterances of the
record-intent catch every word). After capturing the input in the log, and after running the
required functionality (for example – math calculation), the SkillResponse should be built.

www.checkmarx.com

The skill-response includes few parameters, some of which can be abused for an eavesdropping

use-case: https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/request-and-response-json-

reference.html

• The " shouldEndSession" parameter, true by default, can be set to "false". In this case, the
context of the skill will be kept (without the need to say "open calculator" once again).
Alexa will wait for next intent request (usually used for dialogs with the user).

• The " reprompt" object and its internal outputSpeech can be configured and will be used
by Alexa for a limited time (usually once). In case of a silence or no input-recognition, the

purpose of the "reprompt" is to be voiced by the Echo device to urge the user to give the

required input before the skill will close itself.

Surprisingly the reprompt can be defined with an empty output-speech that the user cannot

hear nor will notice. This will extend the lifetime of the skill by 8 seconds, even if there’s silence

on the user’s side.

The combination of a session that is still open (shouldEndSession=false) and an un-noticeable

(empty) reprompt with a record intent as described above is that even after the user ends the

regular functionality of the skill (math calculation within the calculator), the skill will continue

to record, will capture the spoken words and send them to a log. As long as it will recognize

speech and will pick up words, the eavesdropping will continue. Even the default 8-second

grace of Alexa prior to closing the skill (in case of silence) will be doubled to 16 seconds due

to a silence re-prompt.

# Turning an Echo Into a Spy Device Only Took Some Clever Coding

Researchers didn't have to hack Amazon's Alexa voice assistant to use it for eavesdropping. They just took advantage of the system in place.![Image may contain Coffee Cup Cup and Cylinder](https://media.wired.com/photos/5adfb415e79d8d6a6f76a557/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/echoear-02.jpg)Researchers didn't have to hack Amazon's Alexa voice assistant to use it for eavesdropping. They just took advantage of the system in place.Emily WaiteSave this storySaveSave this storySave

It's important not to overstate [the security risks](https://www.wired.com/story/alexa-call-police-privacy/) of the [Amazon Echo](https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-get-the-most-out-of-your-amazon-echo-dot/) and other so-called smart speakers. They're useful, fun, and generally have [well thought-out privacy protections](https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-echo-and-google-home-voice-data-delete/). Then again, putting a mic in your home naturally invites questions over whether it can be used for eavesdropping—which is why researchers at the security firm Checkmarx started fiddling with Alexa, to see if they could turn it into a spy device. They did, with no intensive meddling required.

The attack, which Amazon has since fixed, follows the intended flow of using and programming an Echo. Because an Echo's mic only activates to send sound over the internet when someone says a wake word—usually "Alexa"— the researchers looked to see if they could piggyback on one of those legitimate reactions to listen in. A few clever manipulations later, they'd achieved their goal.

"We actually did not hack anything, we did not change anything, we just used the features that are given to developers," says Erez Yalon, the head of research at Checkmarx. "We had a few challenges that we had to overcome, but step by step it happened."

In fact, the researchers used an attack technique more common in mobile devices to carry off their eavesdropping. Whereas on a smartphone you [might download a malicious app](https://www.wired.com/story/google-play-store-malware/) that snuck into, say, the Google Play Store, the researchers instead created a malicious Alexa applet—known as a "skill"—that could be uploaded to Amazon's Skill Store. Specifically, the researchers designed a skill that acts as a calculator, but has a lot more going on behind the scenes. (The Checkmarx team did not actually make their skill available to the general public.)

> 'We just used the features that are given to developers.'

Erez Yalon, Checkmarx

To use a skill, you have to say your device's wake word for the mic to begin shuttling audio over the internet for processing. In Checkmarx's example, when the user then asks their enabled calculator to do some simple math, that request gets routed to the skill, which returns the answer. Normally, the interaction would end there, and the mic would stop transmitting. But the researchers programmed their skill so that instead, a developer functionality called “shouldEndSession” would automatically keep the Echo listening for another cycle.

Even then, normally Alexa would give a verbal "readback" prompt, letting the user know that it was still actively engaged. The researchers found, though, that they could simply put empty values into this prompt instead of words, meaning the Echo would stay quiet and wouldn't let a user know that the session was continuing.

Finally, the researchers programmed the skill to transcribe words and sentences spoken during the session, and send that data back to the developer. Normally an Alexa skill would only be programmed to transcribe certain commands, but the researchers were able to adjust this so the skill could record any arbitrary word. They also programmed the skill to expect sentences containing almost any number of words, by generating strings of all different length. Those tweaks combined enabled continued eavesdropping on an unsuspecting target after an Echo interaction seemed to have ended, as seen in the video below.

There are clear limitations to this eavesdropping approach. It would only have given attackers transcriptions, not audio recordings, of a target's conversations. Additionally, even an elongated session, though theoretically endless, would in practice only go on for a few minutes before the Echo would typically shut it down. This means that attackers would only get short bursts of surveillance, and even then only following a user's intentional interaction with a compromised Echo. It's also already difficult enough to find Alexa skills that you're actively seeking out; a user stumbling on a malicious one while casually browsing seems fairly unlikely.

The researchers also note that the Amazon Echo and Echo Dot's blue light stays on throughout this process, indicating to users that the device is still listening. Neither they nor Amazon itself viewed this as an adequate mitigation against the attack, though. The whole point of smart assistants, after all, is that users don't need to look at them to interact with them. And Alexa functionality is increasingly being incorporated into third-party devices and services that don't necessarily have a blue light or equivalent.

As part of expanded defenses, the researchers say that Amazon is now controlling empty prompts more carefully, screening for this type of eavesdropping functionality when it evaluates skills for its store, and cracking down on unusually long sessions. A company spokesperson told WIRED in a statement that, "We have put mitigations in place for detecting this type of skill behavior and reject or suppress those skills when we do."

Still, for people worried about the potential privacy drawbacks of smart assistants, the findings serve as a reminder that inviting a hot mic into your personal space also invites a certain degree of risk. "I wouldn’t say people shouldn’t have smart assistants, I just think people should be aware," says Amit Ashbel, the director of product marketing at Checkmarx. "If you have a device like this at home, in one way or another there is probably some way to impede your privacy and you should watch out."
