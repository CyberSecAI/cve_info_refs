### üíÅ Benefit of Using Plugin

#### üëâ Significant Decrease in Time Taken in Checkout

With the lesser amount of information to fill and only essential steps to be taken for checkout, you reduce the time taken in the checkout process by your customers to a bare minimum. Sure, it will make them happy!

#### üëâ Lesser Frustration and Easy Checkout

Though physical product deliveries require a significant amount of data from the customer, things are not the same in the case of digital products. So, just ask for information that is necessary and let the buyers download/use the product.

#### üëâ Reduced Cart Abandonment Rate

By putting dozens of information fields on checkout form for digital products, you‚Äôre just making sure that your buyer gets frustrated and discards the process. Do not do that. Reduce their hassles and avoid order abandoning.

#### üëâ Increased Sales of your Digital Goods

Quick checkouts and better user experience encourage people to purchase digital goods from you. So whenever you are selling a virtual or downloadable product, do not push your buyers to follow the same process as physical products.

This is the best plugin for digital checkout. it adds a quick checkout button in the shop page and also in single products. also it makes no bug on urls and does not add incorrect get url parameters like some other plugins I have tested do. It is very complete even in the free version which I use. (updated) I asked to the support to update the plugin because it is very necessary in my testing experience, to all woocommerce shops. And they listened to me and updated it recently.

Thought this might help with this issue.
As soon as it was activated FluentCRM told me it was incompatible with the SMTP driver.
FluentCRM is too important to be trashed.
Guess who gets cut?

Tried other Woocommerce checkout form field editors, too complicated for what I needed. This one is ideal to eliminate customer info that‚Äôs not needed for digital goods, reduce friction for customer. Use hint: To remove fields you added by mistake, click after the last field added. Then delete. You‚Äôll need to add the fields again that you want. To authors ‚Äì avoid feature creep and please don‚Äôt complicate the free version of this plugin. Thanks for making this!
