- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The web installer application would autofill password fields after a form validation error or navigating to a previous install step, and then display the plain text password for the administrator account on the confirmation screen.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information Disclosure. Plain text password leakage.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with local access to the system could potentially gain the administrator's password, leading to unauthorized access to the Joomla! installation.
- **Attack vectors:** By navigating through the web installer and potentially triggering a form validation error or returning to a previous step, an attacker can cause the installer to display the plain text administrator password on the confirmation screen.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to have access to the web installer application of a vulnerable Joomla! instance to trigger the vulnerability. This suggests a need for some level of local or network access to the server running the installer.
