Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-11101:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Signal-desktop application fails to properly sanitize specific HTML tags when replying to a message containing HTML code. This allows for the injection of malicious HTML code into chat windows.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary HTML into the Signal-desktop client.
- **Lack of input sanitization:** The application does not sufficiently sanitize user-provided HTML, allowing malicious tags to be rendered.
- **Missing CSP header:** The absence of a Content Security Policy (CSP) header allows for the execution of remote resources, including Javascript.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can execute arbitrary code by injecting malicious HTML, specifically using iframes. This includes downloading/uploading files and stealing information.
- **Display of arbitrary content:** Injecting iframes allows display of arbitrary content.
- **Bypass image download prompt:** Using the `<marquee>` and `<img>` tags, attackers can bypass the "click to download image" prompt to display malicious content.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted message containing HTML code to a Signal-desktop user.
- Replying to the crafted message triggers the injection vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send messages to the targeted user via Signal.
- No local access to the target machine is required; the exploit is remotely triggerable.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is a variant of CVE-2018-10994.
- The vulnerability can be exploited using `<iframe>`, `<img>` and `<script>` tags.
- On Windows, using SMB shares, it's possible to execute remote JavaScript.
-  The vulnerability is triggered by replying to a message that contains HTML and the reply does not need to include specific content.
- The issue was resolved in version 1.11 of the Signal-desktop client.
