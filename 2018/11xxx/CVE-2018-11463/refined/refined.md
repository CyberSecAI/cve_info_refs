- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow exists in the service command application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow in the service command application.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit allows a local attacker to execute code with elevated privileges, potentially compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the affected system is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access to the system and user-level privileges are required for exploitation. No user interaction is required for successful exploitation.
