```
- Root cause of vulnerability: When the `invalidate_session` option is disabled, CSRF tokens were not cleared upon user logout.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: CSRF token fixation.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker could potentially reuse a CSRF token obtained from a logged-out user to perform actions on behalf of that user if they log back in, without the user's knowledge or consent.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is present when a user logs out of an application, but their session is not invalidated and CSRF tokens are not cleared, allowing an attacker to use a previously captured CSRF token.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to obtain a CSRF token of a logged-in user before they log out, and then the user must log out without session invalidation and log back in.
