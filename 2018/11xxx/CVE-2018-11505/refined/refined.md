Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-11505:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insecure logging practices within the Werewolf Online Android application. The developers log sensitive information, specifically the Firebase token, to the Android system log.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Insecure Logging:** The application logs the Firebase token, a sensitive piece of data used for authentication, to the Android log (logcat).
-   **Information Disclosure:**  By accessing the Android logs, an attacker can obtain the Firebase token.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   An attacker who gains access to the Firebase token can potentially impersonate the user associated with that token.
- The attacker could send malicious requests to the server on behalf of the user.
- This could potentially lead to account takeover or other unauthorized actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Logcat access:** The attacker needs access to the Android system logs (logcat). This typically requires root access to the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Rooted Android Device or ADB access:** The attacker requires a rooted Android device or the ability to use the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to access the logcat output.
-   **Knowledge of logcat:** The attacker should be familiar with logcat and able to filter the logs to identify the relevant information.
-   **Target application:** The attacker needs to have the vulnerable version of the Werewolf Online application installed.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating how to extract the Firebase token using `logcat`.
- The PoC shows a sample PUT request to `/players/meAndCheckAppVersion`, highlighting how the Firebase token is used in the request body.
- The vulnerability is specific to version 0.8.8 of the Werewolf Online Android application.
- The exploit was tested on Android 4.4.
