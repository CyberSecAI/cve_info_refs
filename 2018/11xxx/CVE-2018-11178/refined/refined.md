Root cause of vulnerability:
The Quest DR Series Disk Backup software contains multiple command injection vulnerabilities due to improper neutralization of special elements used in OS commands. User-supplied input is incorporated into command strings without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to inject and execute arbitrary system commands.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command [CWE-78]
- Execution with Unnecessary Privileges [CWE-250]

Impact of exploitation:
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands with root privileges on the affected appliance. This can lead to complete system compromise, data breaches, and denial of service.

Attack vectors:
The vulnerabilities are primarily exposed through the web interface's JSON-RPC API, which is used to manage system configurations. Attackers can inject commands via various parameters in the API calls.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Unauthenticated attackers can exploit the 'Logon' method by injecting commands into the 'Password' parameter, or 'UserName' if Active Directory is configured.
- Authenticated attackers can exploit numerous other methods exposed by the JSON-RPC API by injecting commands into various parameters of these API calls.
- Successful exploitation of any command injection vulnerability would give the attacker the initial foothold, from where they can escalate to root privileges by abusing sudo access granted to the web server user via multiple methods (perl, env, local scripts, strace, ocashell, setsid).
