  "CVE-2018-11796": {
    "Description": "The provided content discusses CVE-2018-11796 which is related to an incomplete fix for an XML entity expansion vulnerability in Apache Tika. This incomplete fix could lead to a denial of service (DoS) attack.",
    "Root cause": "An incomplete fix for CVE-2018-11761 in Apache Tika 1.19 added an entity expansion limit for XML parsing. However, Tika reuses SAXParsers and calls reset() after each parse, which, for Xerces2 parsers, removes the user-specified SecurityManager and thus removes entity expansion limits after the first parse.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incomplete fix for XML entity expansion vulnerability",
      "Reusing SAXParsers and calling reset() which removes user-specified SecurityManager"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive resource consumption caused by XML entity expansion.",
      "Attack vectors": "By processing a specially crafted XML document with excessive entity expansions",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to submit crafted XML documents to be processed by the vulnerable Tika component."
