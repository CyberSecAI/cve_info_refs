Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-11408:

**CVE-2018-11408: Open redirect vulnerability on security handlers**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: An edge case was missed in a previous fix for an open redirect vulnerability (CVE-2017-16652). Specifically, when the `security.http_utils` service was inlined by the container, the fix was not effective. This allowed an attacker to potentially redirect users to an arbitrary URL.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: Open redirect vulnerability, specifically a failure to properly sanitize the redirect target when the `security.http_utils` service was inlined.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**: An attacker can redirect users to a malicious website, which could be used for phishing, malware distribution, or other malicious purposes.
*   **Attack Vectors**: The attack vector is through manipulating the redirect target. The specific details of how the redirect target is manipulated are not fully detailed in the provided documents, but it involves interaction with the security handlers of the Symfony framework.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker must be able to influence the redirect target. This likely involves crafting a specific request with a malicious redirect URL. The attacker does not need prior authentication.

**Summary of Fix**
The fix addresses the edge case where `security.http_utils` is inlined, ensuring that redirect targets are properly validated and sanitized even in this situation.

**Affected Versions**
Symfony versions 2.7.0 to 2.7.47, 2.8.0 to 2.8.40, 3.3.0 to 3.3.16, 3.4.0 to 3.4.10, and 4.0.0 to 4.0.10 are affected.
The issue is fixed in Symfony versions 2.7.48, 2.8.41, 3.3.17, 3.4.11, and 4.0.11. Version 4.1.0 was also fixed before its final release.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This CVE is a follow-up to CVE-2017-16652.
