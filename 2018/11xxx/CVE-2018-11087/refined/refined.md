- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Spring RabbitMQ Java Client does not perform hostname validation when establishing SSL connections. This means it blindly accepts SSL certificates from other hosts as long as they are trusted by the client's trust store.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing hostname verification during TLS handshake. This allows a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker to present a valid but incorrect certificate.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker performing a MITM attack can intercept, read, or modify communication between the Java application using the vulnerable Spring RabbitMQ Java client and the actual RabbitMQ server. This could lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack between the Java application and the RabbitMQ server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the client application and the RabbitMQ server and have a valid certificate trusted by the client.
