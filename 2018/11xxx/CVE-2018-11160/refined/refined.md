{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Quest DR Series Disk Backup software contains multiple command injection vulnerabilities due to improper sanitization of user-supplied inputs in various JSON-RPC API methods.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command [CWE-78]",
    "Execution with Unnecessary Privileges [CWE-250]"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary system commands on the appliance with root permissions, leading to complete system compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerabilities are exposed through a web interface that uses a JSON-RPC API. Attackers can send crafted requests with malicious payloads embedded in various parameters of the API calls.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker can be unauthenticated for some vulnerabilities (e.g., the login method). For most of the vulnerabilities, the attacker needs to be authenticated on the web interface to exploit them.  Successful exploitation of any of the command injection vulnerabilities provides an initial foothold. Further privilege escalation to root is possible by abusing sudo access to various binaries available on the system."
