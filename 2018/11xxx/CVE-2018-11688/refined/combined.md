### Simple and Effective Vulnerability Identification Approach Vulnerability scanners are great tools to identify vulnerabilities, but they have drawbacks. Weekly or monthly vulnerability scanning routines cause long latencies on vulnerability identification. Additionally, vulnerability scanning processes usually fail to scan software like web browsers, pdf readers, or word processors. And some hosts in IT infrastructure are not reachable by vulnerability scanners. Vulmon Alerts' proactive vulnerability identification approach lets you be aware of critical vulnerabilities without vulnerability scanning. Vulmon Alerts provide instant software vulnerability alerts. So you get notified about newly published vulnerabilities that affect your infrastructure in minutes. [Get Started](/register)

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

# Re: Ignite Realtime Openfire Version 3.7.1 Reflected Cross Site Scripting (CVE-2018-11688)

```
Thanks Yavuz,

this appears to have been addressed in 3.9.2 release of OpenFire in May
2014.

I'm unable to reproduce in OpenFire 4.2.3.

I would strongly suggest running the latest version of OpenFire (4.2.3 at
time of writing) as there were multiple XSS and other security issues
(missing CSRF for example) addressed since 3.7.1.

I'd also suggest people exercise caution with the OpenFire admin interface,
although we've found and resolved a number of issues through testing, there
is no CSP or other systematic control to prevent XSS in the event one of
the filters is missing or misconfigured. I'm know (personal communication)
that the developers do intend to add such controls in future releases.

The Ignite Realtime Security contact address for reporting OpenFire issues
is security () igniterealtime org

## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```
# nmap -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org

## [Version 1.2.0 of Threaddump plugin Released!](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/version-1-2-0-of-threaddump-plugin-released "Version 1.2.0 of Threaddump plugin Released!")

Posted by [Guus der Kinderen](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/u/guus)2 months, 3 weeks ago

Today, we’ve released a new version of the Threaddump plugin for Openfire: version 1.2.0.

The Threaddump plugin is a handy plugin to collect diagnostics, useful for drilling down into the inner workings of Openfire. It can be of great value for developers, but is of little use to others.

In this new release, compatibility with Openfire versions 4.8.0 and later has been restored! To do so, some functionality was sacrificed: the plugin will no longer offer the possibility to automatically generate thread dumps when core thread pools reach a certain level of activity.

As always, your instance of Openfire should automatically make available to update in the next few hours. Alternatively, you can download the new release of the plugin at the [Threaddump plugin’s archive page](https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/plugin-archive.jsp?plugin=threaddump).

## [Openfire 4.9.1 release](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/openfire-4-9-1-release "Openfire 4.9.1 release")

Posted by [Guus der Kinderen](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/u/guus)2 months, 3 weeks ago

The [Ignite Realtime community](https://www.igniterealtime.org/) is happy to be able to announce the immediate availability of version 4.9.1 of [Openfire](https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/), its cross-platform real-time collaboration server based on the XMPP protocol!

4.9.1 is a bugfix and maintenance release. Among its most important fixes is one for a memory leak that affected all recent versions of Openfire (but was likely noticeable only on those servers that see high volume of users logging in and out). The complete list of changes that have gone into this release can be seen in the [change log](https://download.igniterealtime.org/openfire/docs/latest/changelog.html).

Please give this version a try! You can [download installers of Openfire here](https://igniterealtime.org/downloads/#openfire). Our documentation contains an [upgrade guide](https://download.igniterealtime.org/openfire/docs/latest/documentation/upgrade-guide.html) that helps you update from an older version.

## [Openfire 4.9.0 release!](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/openfire-4-9-0-release "Openfire 4.9.0 release!")

Posted by [Guus der Kinderen](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/u/guus)4 months, 1 week ago

The [Ignite Realtime community](https://www.igniterealtime.org/) is happy to be able to announce the immediate availability of version 4.9.0 of [Openfire](https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/), its cross-platform real-time collaboration server based on the XMPP protocol!

As compared to the previous non-patch release, this one is a bit smaller. This mostly is a maintenance release, and includes some preparations (deprecations, mainly) for a future release.

Highlights for this release:

* A problem has been fixed that caused, under certain conditions, a client connection to be disconnected. This appears to have affected clients sending multi-byte character data more than others.
* Community member Akbar Azimifar has provided a full Persian translation for Openfire!

The list of changes that have gone into the Openfire 4.9.0 release has some more items though! Please review the [change log](https://download.igniterealtime.org/openfire/docs/latest/changelog.html) for all of the details.

Interested in getting started? You can [download installers of Openfire here](https://igniterealtime.org/downloads/#openfire).

Posted by [Guus der Kinderen](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/u/guus)4 months, 1 week ago

We have now released version 1.4.1 of the HTTP File Upload plugin!

This plugin adds functionality to Openfire that allows clients to share files, as defined in the [XEP-0363 ‘HTTP File Upload’ specification](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0363.html).

This release brings [two changes](https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/plugins/1.4.1/httpfileupload/changelog.html), both provided by community members (thanks!):

* Vladislav updated the Ukrainian translation;
* Anno created an admin console page for this plugin.

As always, your instance of Openfire should automatically make available to update in the next few hours. Alternatively, you can download the new release of the plugin at the [HTTP File Upload plugin’s archive page](https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/plugin-archive.jsp?plugin=httpfileupload).

## [Openfire Hazelcast plugin version 3.0.0](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/openfire-hazelcast-plugin-version-3-0-0 "Openfire Hazelcast plugin version 3.0.0")

Posted by [Guus der Kinderen](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/u/guus)4 months, 2 weeks ago

Earlier today, [we blogged about a boatload of Openfire plugins](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/openfire-plugin-maintenance-releases) for which we made available maintenance releases.

Apart from that, we’ve also made a more notable release: that of the Hazelcast plugin for Openfire.

The [Hazelcast plugin for Openfire](https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/plugin-archive.jsp?plugin=hazelcast) adds clustering support to Openfire. It is based on [the Hazelcast platform](https://hazelcast.com/).

This release brings a major upgrade of the platform. It migrates from version 3.12.5 to 5.3.7.

As a result, replacing an older version of the plugin with this new release requires some careful planning. Notably, the configuration stored on-disk has changed (and is unlikely to be compatible between versions). Please refer to the readme of the plugin for details.

A big thank you goes out to community member Arwen for making this upgrade happen!

As usual, the new version of the plugin will become available in your Openfire server within the next few hours. Alternatively, you can download the plugin from [its archive page](https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/plugin-archive.jsp?plugin=hazelcast).

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).
