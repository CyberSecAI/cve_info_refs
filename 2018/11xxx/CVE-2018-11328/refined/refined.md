- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  A lack of escaping the user-info component of a URI within the redirect method. This occurs under specific conditions when a redirect is issued with a URI containing a username and password, and the Location header cannot be used.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the user's browser through the redirect mechanism, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploiting the redirect function with a crafted URI that includes a username and password, particularly in scenarios where the Location header is not usable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to influence or control the generation of a redirect URI, including the ability to inject a malicious user-info component.
