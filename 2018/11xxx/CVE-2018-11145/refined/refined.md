Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-11145:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper neutralization of special elements used in OS commands, specifically within the 'delete' method of the DRUsers class in the Quest DR Series Disk Backup software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command injection vulnerability: The 'user' parameter of the `delete` method is not sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary system commands.
- Lack of proper input validation/sanitization when handling user-supplied data in the JSON-RPC API.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the appliance with root privileges.
- Complete compromise of the system: Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to gain full control over the affected system, potentially leading to data breaches, data loss or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- The attack vector is the JSON-RPC API of the Quest DR Series Disk Backup software.
- Specifically, the `delete` method of the `DRUsers` class.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit this specific vulnerability.
- They need to be able to send crafted requests to the JSON-RPC API.
- Knowledge of the JSON-RPC API and how to interact with the delete method of DRUsers class.
- They would need a valid `SessionCookie` to authenticate and be authorized to make the call.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to `/ws/v1.0/jsonrpc` with a JSON payload that calls the `delete` method and contains a malicious command in the `user` parameter.
- The provided proof of concept injects a 'sleep' command to demonstrate the vulnerability.
- The advisory provides detailed HTTP request examples showing how to exploit the vulnerability.
- The exploitation leads to command execution as the web server user (webadmin), which can further be escalated to root due to other privilege escalation vulnerabilities present in the system as described in sections 7.47 to 7.52.
