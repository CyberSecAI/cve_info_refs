- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Passwords for administrative users are stored in the local file system, and an attacker with access to this file system can obtain them.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure storage of administrative passwords.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker gaining access to the local file system can obtain administrative user passwords. This could lead to full control of the affected device, allowing an attacker to read or modify the device configuration, or exploit other vulnerabilities that require authentication as administrative user.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the file system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs read access to the files on the local file system.
