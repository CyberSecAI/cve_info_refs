Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-11251:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `SetGrayscaleImage` function within the ImageMagick library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Heap-buffer-overflow:**  The `SetGrayscaleImage` function attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory, leading to a heap-buffer-overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The vulnerability can be exploited to cause a denial of service due to a crash from the memory corruption.
*   **Potential code execution:** Some advisories mention the possibility of arbitrary code execution although this is not explicitly stated in the github issue.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Crafted Image File:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted image file.
*   **Image Processing:** The vulnerability occurs during image processing, specifically when attempting to convert an image to grayscale using the `SetGrayscaleImage` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted image file to a system or application using the vulnerable version of ImageMagick.
*   The user or an automated system needs to process the malicious file with a vulnerable version of ImageMagick

**Additional details:**

*   The GitHub issue #956 provides a more specific description of the vulnerability, including the vulnerable code location (`MagickCore/quantize.c:3444`) and an ASAN output showing the overflow.
*   The issue is triggered when using the command `magick buffer-overflow-SetGrayscaleImage /dev/null`, where `buffer-overflow-SetGrayscaleImage` is the specially crafted image.
*   Multiple advisories (Debian, Ubuntu) confirm the presence of this CVE.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in ImageMagick version 8:6.7.7.10-5+deb7u22 for Debian 7, version 8:6.8.9.9-5+deb8u13 for Debian 8, version 8:6.9.7.4+dfsg-11+deb9u5 for Debian 9, and corresponding versions for Ubuntu.
