**CVE-2018-11416 is not mentioned, but there are several relevant fixes mentioned which may be related to other CVEs.**

*   **v1.5.3**: Fixes a "potential heap-buffer-overflow (read) when using stdin/stdout and processing corrupt JPEG"
    *   **Root cause:** Processing of corrupt JPEG images through stdin/stdout leads to an out-of-bounds read.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Heap-buffer-overflow (read)
    *   **Impact:**  Potential crash or other undefined behavior.
    *   **Attack vector:** Processing a specially crafted (corrupt) JPEG image.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malformed JPEG image to the application.

*   **v1.4.5**: "fix memcmp() potentially reading past end of buffer"
    *   **Root cause**: Improper bounds checking when using `memcmp()`
    *  **Vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds read
    *   **Impact**: Potential crash or other undefined behavior.
    *   **Attack vector:** Processing a specially crafted input
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malformed JPEG image to the application.

*   **v1.4.3**: "fix bug that could cause jpegoptim crash when processing certain jpeg files"
    *  **Root cause**: Unknown bug triggered when processing certain JPEG files
    *  **Vulnerability**: Crash
    *  **Impact**: Denial of service
    *  **Attack vector**: Processing a specially crafted input
    *  **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a malformed JPEG image to the application.

*   **v1.5.1**: "fix crashes when processing certain broken JPEG images"
    *   **Root cause:**  Unhandled cases or errors when processing malformed JPEG images.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Crash due to processing of broken images
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service.
    *   **Attack vector:** Processing of specially crafted (broken) JPEG images
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malformed JPEG image to the application.
