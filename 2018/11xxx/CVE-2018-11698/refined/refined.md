- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A single byte out-of-bounds read in the `Sass::handle_error` function within `libsass/src/sass_context.cpp`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-buffer-overflow (out-of-bounds read).
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The vulnerability can lead to a crash of the application due to the out-of-bounds read, as demonstrated by the AddressSanitizer report.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted Sass file which, when parsed by libsass, causes an out-of-bounds read during error handling. This can be achieved through a tool like `sassc` which is used as a harness during fuzzing.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to provide a malicious Sass file to the libsass library to trigger the vulnerability. The attacker also needs a tool to utilize the library.
