{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Quest DR Series Disk Backup software contains multiple command injection vulnerabilities due to improper neutralization of special elements in OS commands. User-supplied input is not sanitized before being used in command line strings.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command [CWE-78]",
     "Execution with Unnecessary Privileges [CWE-250]"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary system commands on the appliance with root permissions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely via the exposed JSON-RPC API. Both unauthenticated and authenticated command injection vulnerabilities exist.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Unauthenticated attackers can exploit the 'Logon' method. Authenticated attackers require a valid session cookie to exploit the other command injection vulnerabilities. Exploitation of any command injection vector allows gaining initial foothold to escalate to root privileges."
