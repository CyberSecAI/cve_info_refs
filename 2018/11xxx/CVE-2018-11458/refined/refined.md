- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The integrated VNC server on port 5900/tcp of the affected products is vulnerable to code execution due to specially crafted network requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of network requests by the VNC server.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute code with privileged permissions, potentially compromising confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the VNC server and the system.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending specially crafted network requests to the VNC server on port 5900/tcp.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Network access to the affected device. No user privileges or interaction are required for exploitation. The vulnerability is only exploitable if port 5900/tcp is manually opened in the firewall configuration of network port X130.
