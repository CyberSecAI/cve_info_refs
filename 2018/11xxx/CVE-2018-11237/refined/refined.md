  "CVE-2018-11237": {
    "description": "The GNU C Library incorrectly handled certain AVX-512-optimized mempcpy operations. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause the GNU C Library to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.",

    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Buffer overflow"

    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote attacker"
