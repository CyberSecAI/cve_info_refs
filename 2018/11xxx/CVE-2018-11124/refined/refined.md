Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-11124:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the "Attributes" functionality of Open-AudIT Community edition. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user-supplied input when setting attribute names.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability. By injecting malicious script or HTML code into an attribute name field, the injected code will be executed when other users view or export this data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Web Script Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code, potentially leading to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Defacement
  - Redirection to malicious websites
  - Data theft
  - Other client-side attacks.
- **HTML Injection:** Attackers can also inject arbitrary HTML code, enabling them to alter the page's appearance or inject malicious content into the exported HTML files.
- **Malicious redirection:**  Specifically, the attacker can create a malicious hyperlink to redirect the user to an external malicious website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack vector is through the web interface of Open-AudIT.
- **Specific Functionality:** The vulnerability is located in the "Attributes" functionality, specifically the "Name" field of an attribute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of Open-AudIT, with the ability to access and modify the "Attributes" section of the application.
- **Knowledge of Target:**  The attacker must know how to navigate to the "Attributes" page, and know how to modify attribute values.

**Additional Details:**
- The content provides a detailed Proof of Concept (POC) with specific steps for reproducing the vulnerability:
    - Logging into Open-AudIT.
    - Navigating to the Attributes page.
    - Selecting an attribute.
    - Inputting malicious JavaScript or HTML into the Name field of the attribute.
    - Exporting the HTML table.
    - When a user opens the exported HTML file, the injected script or HTML will be executed.
- The vulnerability affects Open-AudIT Community edition versions prior to 2.2.2.
- The content suggests that the vulnerability was tested on Windows 10.
