Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2018-11452:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the processing of specially crafted network packets sent to port 102/tcp. This occurs specifically when oscillograph functionality is active on the EN100 communication module.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper handling of network packets on port 102/tcp when oscillographs are running.
- Lack of sufficient input validation or error handling in network packet processing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the EN100 communication module.
- Loss of network functionality on the affected device.
- System unavailability.
- Requires manual restart to recover functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack: Sending specially crafted packets to port 102/tcp.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the affected EN100 module.
- Ability to send network packets to port 102/tcp.
- IEC 61850-MMS communication needs to be activated on the target module as a precondition
- No specific user interaction or privileges are required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects the EN100 Ethernet communication module in Siemens products such as SIPROTEC 5 relays and SWT3000 devices.
- The issue is triggered when oscillographs are running on the affected EN100 module.
- The vulnerability is distinct from CVE-2018-11451, although both vulnerabilities involve crafted packets sent to port 102/tcp.
- Siemens has released firmware updates to address the vulnerability in specific products and provides workarounds (blocking port 102/tcp) for those products without updates available.
