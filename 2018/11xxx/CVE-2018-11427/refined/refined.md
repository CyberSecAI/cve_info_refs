- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The web application of Moxa OnCell G3100-HSPA Series devices lacks CSRF tokens.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability due to the absence of CSRF tokens in the web application.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can impersonate administrative actions via the web interface of the affected devices. This could lead to unauthorized configuration changes, denial of service, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is remote. An attacker could craft malicious web pages or links that, when clicked by an authenticated user, would trigger unauthorized actions on the Moxa device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick an authenticated administrator user into visiting a malicious link or page and triggering the CSRF request. The attacker does not need direct access to the Moxa device.
