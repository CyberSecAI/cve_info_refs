{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The 'delete' subroutine in the 'StorageGroupService' module passes user generated input to the 'storage_group' system binary without sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command [CWE-78]"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution as root.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted JSON-RPC request to the 'delete' method of the 'DRStorageGroup' class, an attacker can inject arbitrary system commands via the 'name' parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated on the web application."
