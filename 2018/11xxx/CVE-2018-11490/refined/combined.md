# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

Package        : giflib
Version        : 5.1.4-3+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-11490 CVE-2019-15133
Debian Bug     : 904114

This update fixes two file format vulnerabilities in giflib.

CVE-2018-11490

    The DGifDecompressLine function in dgif_lib.c, as later shipped in
    cgif.c in sam2p 0.49.4, has a heap-based buffer overflow because a
    certain "Private->RunningCode - 2" array index is not checked.  This
    will lead to a denial of service or possibly unspecified other
    impact.

CVE-2019-15133

    A malformed GIF file triggers a divide-by-zero exception in the
    decoder function DGifSlurp in dgif_lib.c if the height field of the
    ImageSize data structure is equal to zero.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
5.1.4-3+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your giflib packages.
