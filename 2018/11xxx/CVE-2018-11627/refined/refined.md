  "CVE-2018-11627": {
    "Description": "The sinatra gem is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw.  The sinatra params parser does not properly escape HTML in the 400 Bad Request error message when there is a parameter parsing exception. An attacker could send a crafted request with malicious HTML that would be reflected back in the error message and executed in the user's browser.",
    "Root cause": "The sinatra params parser does not properly escape HTML characters in the error message generated for invalid query parameters.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could inject malicious HTML into the error message which would then be executed by the user's browser. This could lead to various attacks such as session hijacking or defacing of the webpage.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending a crafted HTTP request with a malicious HTML payload in a query parameter."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable sinatra application."
