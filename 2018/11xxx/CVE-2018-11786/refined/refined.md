Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-11786:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control within the Apache Karaf SSH service. When the SSH service is enabled for administrative purposes, any user with access to the Karaf console can leverage it to gain read/write access to the file system. This access is limited only by the permissions of the Karaf process user, not by specific Karaf role-based access controls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** The core weakness is the lack of proper RBAC enforcement within the Karaf SSH console, particularly concerning file system access.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Users with SSH access to the Karaf console can effectively escalate their privileges by reading and writing files on the filesystem with the Karaf process user's permissions.
*   **Lack of File System Restrictions:** Although some mitigations like chroot and security manager policies can be implemented, they are not sufficient to prevent unauthorized access to a large number of files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker with Karaf console access via SSH to read and write any file on the file system that is accessible to the Karaf process user.
*   **Data Breach:** Sensitive data could be read and extracted by the attacker.
*   **System Compromise:** System files could be modified, potentially leading to system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SSH Access to Karaf Console:** The primary attack vector is through SSH access to the Karaf console.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have valid credentials to access the Karaf console via SSH.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was reported by R.A. Porter.
*   The fix for this vulnerability was included in Apache Karaf 4.2.0.M1 and later.
*   Mitigation includes upgrading to the fixed version.
*   JIRA ticket for the issue is  KARAF-5427.
*   The vulnerability is classified as "Moderate" severity.
