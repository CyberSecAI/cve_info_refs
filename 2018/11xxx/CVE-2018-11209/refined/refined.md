Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-11209:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of weak MD5 hashing for password verification in Z-BlogPHP 2.0.0's login page, specifically within `zb_system/cmd.php?act=verify`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Weak Cryptography:** The use of MD5 for password hashing is a significant weakness, as MD5 is considered cryptographically broken and susceptible to collision attacks and rainbow table lookups.
- **Single Factor Authentication:** The authentication mechanism relies solely on the MD5 hash of the password, without any additional security measures like salting.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypass Authentication:** Attackers can bypass login restrictions by using precomputed MD5 hashes or rainbow tables to crack the password.
- **Full System Access:** Successful exploitation can allow attackers to gain access to the administrative backend of the Z-BlogPHP website.
- **Full Control:** Once logged in, attackers have full control over the website and can perform malicious actions, including content manipulation, data theft, and potentially further compromising the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attack is conducted remotely over the network.
- **Dictionary or Rainbow Table Attack:** Attackers can use pre-computed MD5 hashes or rainbow tables to crack the password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Z-BlogPHP login page.
- **Dictionary/Rainbow Table:** The attacker needs to possess a dictionary or rainbow table of MD5 hashes.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know how to intercept and modify HTTP requests to carry out the attack.
- **High Privileges Required**  As the attacker would need to impersonate an administrator of the web application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vendor disputed this issue as a valid vulnerability
- The issue was reported by `Jayway007` and labeled as "Defrauding CVE" by the vendor.
