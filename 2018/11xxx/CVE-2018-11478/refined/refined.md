Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-11478:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The Vgate iCar 2 Wi-Fi OBD2 dongle exposes its on-board diagnostics (OBD) interface directly through port 35000 of its unprotected Wi-Fi access point. This interface, intended for maintenance purposes, lacks authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Unauthenticated access:** The OBD interface is directly accessible without any authentication mechanism.
*   **Direct exposure:** The OBD interface is reachable through the unprotected Wi-Fi network, making it accessible to anyone within range.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Data Theft**: Attackers can read sensitive information from the car's CAN bus, such as vehicle information and sensor data.
*   **Malicious Control**: Attackers can send arbitrary commands to the car via the CAN bus, potentially manipulating safety-critical functions. This can include things like controlling the engine, brakes, or other systems.
*   **Safety critical threat**: Given the ability to send commands to safety-critical car functions, this vulnerability is considered a significant threat.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Wireless access:** An attacker connects to the unprotected Wi-Fi network created by the OBD2 dongle.
*   **Network port access:** The attacker can then access the OBD interface through port 35000 of the dongle.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within the range of the dongle's Wi-Fi network.
*   **Network knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to Wi-Fi networks and interact with network ports.
*   **OBD command knowledge:** The attacker requires knowledge of the commands that the target vehicle uses over the OBD interface.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vendor considers these security issues "common practice" and has stated they will not be fixed.
*   The advisory mentions that other branded OBD2 dongles may use the same hardware and therefore be vulnerable.
*   The device uses a "Fn-Link (6110R-IF)" chip to provide the Wi-Fi access, and an ELM327 compatible "iCar-2" chip for the OBD interface.
