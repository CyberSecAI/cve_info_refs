- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Apache Karaf features deployer parses features XML files using the `XMLInputFactory` class, which does not have mitigations against XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is an XXE injection, caused by the insecure parsing of XML files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could inject external XML entities. This can allow the attacker to read local files, perform SSRF, or cause a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit this by crafting a malicious features XML file containing external entity declarations and dropping the file into the deploy folder.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to drop files into the Karaf deploy folder.
