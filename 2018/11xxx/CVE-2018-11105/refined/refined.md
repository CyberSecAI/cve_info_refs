Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-11105:

**1. Verification:**
The content from `github.com_12b290bc_20250126_091058.html`  directly relates to CVE-2018-11105. It provides a detailed write-up about the vulnerability.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "wp-live-chat-support" plugin for WordPress.
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the "name" (`wplc_name`) and "email" (`wplc_email`) fields during chat initiation.
- An incomplete fix for a previous CVE-2018-9864 is also noted as a contributing factor.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to sanitize the "name" and "email" input fields, allowing malicious JavaScript to be stored in the database.
- **Incomplete Fix:** A previous attempt to address a similar vulnerability was not comprehensive, leaving a path for exploitation.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
- When an administrator interacts with specific pages in the WordPress admin panel (chat history or missed chats) that displays the stored chat data, the malicious JavaScript is executed within the administrator's browser session.
- This can lead to various impacts, such as:
   - Session hijacking/account takeover by stealing cookies or tokens.
   - Defacement of the admin panel.
   - Redirecting to other malicious sites.
   - Running administrative tasks on behalf of the admin.
   - Information gathering or data theft

**5. Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** An attacker does not require local access.
- **Attack Flow:**
   1.  The attacker initiates a new chat with a WordPress administrator.
   2.  The attacker includes malicious JavaScript code in the "name" and "email" input fields.
   3.  This data (including malicious code) is stored on the server.
   4.  When an administrator accesses the chat history, missed chat page, or related interfaces the stored script executes in the administrator's browser.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the WordPress site.
   - **Ability to Initiate a Chat:** The attacker must be able to trigger a chat session with an administrator on the target site using the vulnerable plugin functionality.
   - **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker must have identified the vulnerable parameters (wplc_name and wplc_email) and have the ability to craft a POST request.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   **Affected Versions:** All versions of the "wp-live-chat-support" plugin prior to 8.0.08 are affected.

    *   `http://<target-url/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wplivechat-menu-missed-chats`
*   **POST Request Example:** The write-up provides an example of the malicious POST request used for the XSS attack, clearly demonstrating how the malicious code is injected into the `wplc_name` and `wplc_email` parameters.
*   **Fix Confirmation:** The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor and addressed by the patch.
*  **Discoverer:** The vulnerability was discovered by Riccardo ten Cate.
