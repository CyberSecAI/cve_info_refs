Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-11646:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a mishandling of an unset `pageURL` within the `webkitFaviconDatabaseSetIconForPageURL` and `webkitFaviconDatabaseSetIconURLForPageURL` functions in `UIProcess/API/glib/WebKitFaviconDatabase.cpp`. This occurs in WebKit, as used in WebKitGTK+.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The core issue is a NULL pointer dereference or an attempt to access a hash of an invalid string. When `pageURL` is not properly set, these functions attempt to operate on an invalid or null string, leading to a crash.
- The vulnerability is specific to the GLib-specific code and does not affect other WebKit ports, such as Safari.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation results in an application crash, causing a denial of service (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by loading a malicious web page using WebKitGTK+ where JavaScript is used to open new windows and manipulate them.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to serve or host malicious HTML/JavaScript content that is loaded by the vulnerable application using WebKitGTK+. The attacker can be remote.
- The attacker needs no special privileges other than the ability to serve web content.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided exploit code involves opening a new window, navigating it to a URL, stopping the loading process, writing content to the document, and closing it. This manipulation triggers the crash related to the favicon database.
- The backtrace shows that the crash occurs within the `WTF::StringImpl::hash` function or related functions when trying to operate on an invalid string.
- The vulnerability exists in WebKitGTK+ versions prior to 2.21.3.
- The fix involves ensuring that the `pageURL` is valid before attempting to hash it or use it in the favicon database.

**Additional Notes:**
- The bug was initially reported on the GNOME Bugzilla and was later moved to WebKit's Bugzilla.
- Initially, the CVE description inaccurately included Safari as affected, this was later corrected to specify that it only affected the GLib implementation used by WebKitGTK+.
- There was a duplicate CVE request (CVE-2018-12016) which was eventually resolved.
