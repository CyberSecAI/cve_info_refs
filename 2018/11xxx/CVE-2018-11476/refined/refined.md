Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Vgate iCar 2 WiFi OBD2 dongle creates an unprotected WiFi network, and the data transmitted over this network is not encrypted. Additionally, the OBD interface, used for diagnostics and sending commands to the car, is directly accessible without authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Unprotected WiFi Access (CVE-2018-11476):**
    *   The dongle establishes a wireless LAN without any encryption or password protection.
    *   This allows anyone within the network range to connect to the device without authentication.

2.  **Unencrypted Data Transfer (CVE-2018-11477):**
    *   Data exchanged between the mobile application and the OBD dongle is transmitted in plain text.
    *   This, combined with the unprotected WiFi, exposes sensitive car data to anyone monitoring the network.

3.  **Unauthenticated Access to On-board Diagnostics (OBD) (CVE-2018-11478):**
    *   The OBD interface, which is accessible via port 35000 on the dongle's WiFi network, does not require any authentication.
    *   This allows an attacker to directly read data and send commands to the car's systems via the CAN bus.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Critical impact:** An attacker can potentially gain full control over the car's systems and functions.
*   **Read access to vehicle data:** An attacker can intercept and read data from the car's CAN bus (e.g., speed, engine status, etc.).
*   **Write access to vehicle systems:** An attacker can send arbitrary commands to the car's CAN bus, potentially leading to safety-critical issues or malfunctions, including manipulation of safety-critical car functions.
*   **Privacy breach:** Sensitive car data is exposed due to unencrypted transmission.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Wireless network:** An attacker needs to be within the range of the dongle's WiFi network.
*   **Network port 35000:** The attacker connects to the unprotected WiFi and then accesses the OBD interface through port 35000.
*   **Plain text communication:** All commands and data are sent over the network in plain text, making it easy to intercept.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within the range of the dongle's unprotected WiFi network ("V-LINK").
*   **Basic network knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to connect to a WiFi network and communicate over a specific port (35000).
*   **Knowledge of OBD commands (for writing):** To send commands to the car, an attacker would need to have knowledge of the commands specific to the vehicle's communication bus (CAN/FlexRay).

**Additional Details:**

*   The device uses a "Fn-Link (6110R-IF)" as a wireless UART bridge.
*   The device communicates with the ELM327 compatible "iCar-2" chip.
*   The vendor considers these issues "common practice" and will not fix them.
*   Several OBD2 dongles from different vendors are suspected to be rebranded versions of the same vulnerable device.

This vulnerability is considered highly critical because of the potential for a remote attacker to take control of vehicle functions.
