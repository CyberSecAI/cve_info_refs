Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-11093:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `href` attribute in the link (A) element within the CKEditor 5 link plugin. This allows for the injection of arbitrary web scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- Inadequate sanitization of user-supplied input (specifically, the `href` attribute)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote attackers could inject and execute arbitrary web scripts in the context of a user's browser.
- This could lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of web pages.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker could craft a malicious link URL containing JavaScript code within the `href` attribute of the link.
- This crafted link could then be introduced into the content being edited using CKEditor 5.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to input or modify content within the CKEditor 5 environment. This could be achieved via a vulnerable web application using the editor.
- The attacker needs some knowledge of how to inject malicious code into a URL.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported independently by Toan Chi Nguyen and Michal Bazyli.
- The fix involved sanitizing the `href` attribute by ensuring the URL is safe using the `ensureSafeUrl()` function before rendering it in the view.
- The `ensureSafeUrl()` function checks whether the given URL is safe for the user (does not contain any malicious code) by matching it against a regular expression that allows safe protocols like `http`, `https`, `ftp`, `ftps`, `mailto`, and relative URLs. If the URL is deemed unsafe, it defaults to "#".
- The fix was introduced in commit `8cb782e`.
- The fix applies to the "editingDowncast" pipeline, which handles how the link is rendered in the editing view.
