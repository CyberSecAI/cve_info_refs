Vendor description:
-------------------
"MyBiz is a company fixated on developing technology which transforms the way
business is done online. At the intersection of what one business needs from
another is the potential for value to be created differently. This
intersection for the exchange of value requires technology but in
fundamentally very different ways from traditional enterprise systems. MyBiz
believes that the chemistry of business is the business relationships between
enterprises. The strength of the business relationship drives the success and
future of the business. MyBiz believes that these business relationships need
to be captured and orchestrated. MyBiz developed our proprietary Business
Relationship Network engine, a platform to capture business relationships as
data to drive new business services which create value efficiently."

Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor did not reply to our inquiries since February 2018 hence the issues
might still exist in current versions.

SEC Consult recommends not use this product until a thorough security review
has been performed by security professionals and all identified issues have
been resolved. It is assumed that MyBiz products are affected by further
critical security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
The identified vulnerabilities can be exploited after authentication but
the registration for the application is usually open for anyone.

1. Arbitrary File Upload
A malicious file can be uploaded to the webserver by an attacker. It is
possible for an attacker to upload a script to issue operating system
commands.

This vulnerability occurs because an attacker is able to adjust the
"HiddenFieldControlCustomWhiteListedExtensions" parameter and add arbitrary
extensions to the whitelist during the upload.

For instance, if the extension .asp is added to the
"HiddenFieldControlCustomWhiteListedExtensions" parameter, the server
accepts "secctest.asp" as legitimate file. Hence malicious files can be
uploaded in order to execute arbitrary commands to take over the server.

2. Reflected Cross-site scripting
This vulnerability within "ProxyPage.aspx" allows an attacker to inject
malicious client side scripting which will be executed in the browser of
users if they visit the manipulated site.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
The proof of concept has been removed as no patch is available.

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
MyBiz MyProcureNet version 5.0.0 has been tested and found to be vulnerable. This
was the latest version available at the time of the test.
