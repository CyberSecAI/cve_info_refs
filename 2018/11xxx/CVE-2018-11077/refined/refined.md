Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2018-11077:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vSphere Data Protection (VDP) Java management consoleâ€™s SSL/TLS private key is leaked within the VDP Java management client package.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information exposure vulnerability. The private key is exposed within the VDP Java management client package.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated attacker on the same data-link layer could use the leaked private key to initiate a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack against management console users. This could allow the attacker to intercept or manipulate communications between users and the management console.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker must be on the same data-link layer as the vulnerable system. This suggests a local network or LAN attack scenario.
- Exploitation requires the attacker to obtain the VDP Java management client package containing the leaked private key.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be present on the same network segment as the VDP system.
- They must have the ability to obtain the VDP Java management client package, implying some level of access to the software distribution or system where the client is available.

**Additional Notes:**
- The Dell EMC advisory (DSA-2018-155) also mentions CVE-2018-11077, but that vulnerability is related to a command injection in the 'getlogs' utility. It is important to differentiate between the two different issues that share the same CVE identifier as it was assigned in the VMware Security Advisory. The Dell EMC advisory provides information about affected Dell EMC Avamar and IDPA products.
- The VMware advisory states the severity as Moderate, while the Dell EMC advisory rates it as Medium, with a CVSS v3 base score of 6.7 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) for the Dell EMC product.
- The fix for this vulnerability is to upgrade to VDP version 6.1.10 or 6.0.9 depending on the affected version.
