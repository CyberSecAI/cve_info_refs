**b. Open redirection vulnerability.**

VDP contains an open redirection vulnerability. A remote unauthenticated attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to redirect application users to arbitrary web URLs by tricking the victim users to click on maliciously crafted links. The vulnerability could be used to conduct phishing attacks that cause users to unknowingly visit malicious sites.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the identifier CVE-2018-11067 to this issue.
