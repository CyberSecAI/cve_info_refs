    "description": "In Wireshark 2.6.0, 2.4.0 to 2.4.6, and 2.2.0 to 2.2.14, the LDSS dissector could crash. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-ldss.c by avoiding a buffer over-read upon encountering a missing '\\0' character.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The LDSS dissector in Wireshark could crash due to a missing null terminator in the input, leading to a buffer over-read.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer Over-read",
        "Missing Null Terminator check"
      ],
      "impact": "A specially crafted packet can cause Wireshark to crash, leading to denial of service. It may be possible to make Wireshark crash by injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.",
      "attack_vector": "Network",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can inject a malformed packet onto the network or convince someone to open a malformed trace file."
