Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-11119:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**
   - The provided content includes a commit message "fixed bug 23029: redirect" and a code diff that shows a change in the redirect behavior in `Services/Bookmarks/classes/class.ilBookmarkAdministrationGUI.php`. The vulnerability described below aligns with this code change. The issue is related to how the `return_to_url` parameter is handled in the bookmark functionality, which allows for a potential open redirect.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**
   - The root cause is the insufficient validation and sanitization of the `$_POST['return_to_url']` parameter in `ilBookmarkAdministrationGUI.php`. This parameter, intended for redirecting the user back to a previous page, is directly used in the `ilUtil::redirect()` function without proper checks, allowing an attacker to inject a malicious URL.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**
   - **Open Redirect:** The vulnerability is an open redirect, where an attacker can control the destination URL of a redirect. This can be used to redirect users to malicious sites.
   - **Lack of Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper input validation and sanitization of the `return_to_url` parameter. This allows arbitrary URLs to be inserted into the redirect function.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**
   - **Phishing Attacks:** An attacker can use the open redirect to redirect users to a phishing page that mimics the legitimate website, stealing their credentials.
   - **Malware Distribution:** The open redirect can lead users to sites hosting malware, resulting in potential system infections.
   - **Reputation Damage:** Successful exploitation can damage the reputation of the affected system by associating it with malicious activity.

**5. Attack Vectors**
   - The attack vector is through the manipulation of the `return_to_url` parameter during a bookmark creation or cancellation process. This parameter is submitted via a POST request.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**
    - The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the affected ILIAS instance and control the `return_to_url` parameter. Typically, this is achieved by crafting a malicious link or form that includes the exploit. No specific authentication or user position is required, although the attack may target specific user roles within the application that can use the bookmark functionality.

**Code Details:**

The relevant code diff shows the following changes:

+ if($_POST['return_to'])
+    ilUtil::redirect($_POST['return_to_url']);

 }
```

The key is that the `ilUtil::redirect($_POST['return_to_url']);` line directly uses user-provided input to construct the redirect URL, without sanitizing it, which leads to the open redirect vulnerability.
