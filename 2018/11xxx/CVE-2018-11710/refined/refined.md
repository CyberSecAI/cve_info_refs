CVE-2018-11710:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: Out-of-memory situation when reading AMS files. Specifically, inconsistent CPattern objects (empty m_ModCommands and m_Rows=64) due to allocation failure of pattern data.
  - Weakness: A write near address 0 (NULL pointer dereference write) can occur after an out-of-memory event.
  - Impact of exploitation: Crash (write near address NULL).
  - Attack vector: By providing a crafted AMS file that triggers an out-of-memory condition during pattern data allocation.
  - Required attacker capabilities: Ability to provide a specially crafted AMS file to the application using libopenmpt.
