## Last modification

* Rev 10149 – 2467 d 9 h
* **Author:** sagamusix
* **Log message:**[Fix] Do not initialize CPattern objects with inconsistent m\_ModCommands (empty) and m\_Rows (64) values. In an OOM situation where allocation of the pattern data fails, this leaves an inconsistent pattern object behind. This fixes a crash (write near address NULL) in the AMS loader.

# libopenmpt security updates 0.3.9, 0.2.10172-beta32, 0.2.7561-beta20.5-p9, 0.2.7386-beta20.3-p12

2018-04-29

The OpenMPT/libopenmpt project released the latest stable libopenmpt version:

## libopenmpt 0.3.9 (2018-04-29)

* [**Sec**] Possible write near address 0 in out-of-memory situations when
  reading AMS files (r10149).
  ([CVE-2018-11710](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-11710))
* [**Bug**] openmpt123: Fixed build failure in C++17 due to use of removed
  feature `std::random_shuffle`.
* STM: Having both Bxx and Cxx commands in a pattern imported the Bxx command
  incorrectly.
* STM: Last character of sample name was missing.
* Speed up reading of truncated ULT files.
* ULT: Portamento import was sometimes broken.
* The resonant filter was sometimes unstable when combining low-volume
  samples, low cutoff and high mixing rates.

The changelog for older versions can be found at
<https://lib.openmpt.org/doc/changelog.html> .
