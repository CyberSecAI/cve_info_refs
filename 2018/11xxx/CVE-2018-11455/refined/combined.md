WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict network access as far as possible

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The Automation License Manager (ALM) centrally manages license keys for various Siemens software
products. Software products requiring license keys automatically report this requirement to the ALM.
When the ALM ﬁnds a valid license key for this software, the software can be used in conformity with the
end user license agreement.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.0
(CVSS v3.0) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-11455

A directory traversal vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to move arbitrary ﬁles, which can result
in code execution, compromising conﬁdentiality, integrity and availability of the system. Successful
exploitation requires a network connection to the affected device. The attacker does not need privileges
or special conditions of the system, but user interaction is required.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this securtiy vulnerability was known.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-11456

An attacker with network access to the device could send specially crafted network packets to
determine whether or not a network port on another remote system is accessible or not. This allows
the attacker to do basic network scanning using the victims machine.

Successful exploitation requires a network connection to the affected device. The attacker does not
need privileges, no user interaction is required. The impact is limited to determining whether or not a
port on a target system is accessible by the affected device.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.
