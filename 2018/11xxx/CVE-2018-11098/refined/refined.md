The provided content describes a file upload vulnerability in Frog CMS 0.9.5.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper file type validation during the file upload process. The `AllowedFiletype()` function, which is supposed to check the file type, does not perform any validation, allowing any file type to be uploaded.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted file upload: The application does not restrict the type of files that can be uploaded.
- Missing file type validation: The `AllowedFiletype()` function fails to check or validate the file type being uploaded.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: By uploading a malicious PHP script, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially gaining complete control of the application and server.
- Data breach: The attacker could use the arbitrary code execution to access sensitive information stored on the server.
- Website defacement: The attacker could modify the website content or inject malicious code into the site.

**Attack vectors:**
- File upload functionality: The attack vector is the file upload feature within the Frog CMS application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the file upload functionality, typically through the administrative interface or a vulnerable file upload form.
- The attacker needs to be able to upload files.
