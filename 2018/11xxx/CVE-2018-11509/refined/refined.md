{
  "CVE-2018-11509": {
    "Root cause": "Default, unchanged credentials for multiple applications and the NAS device itself, combined with publicly accessible 'setup complete' page that allows access to these applications.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Credentials Management (CWE-255)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can gain root level access to applications, upload webshells, compromise end-user data, and gain a foothold on the appliance due to default credentials that are not changed upon NAS initialization.",
    "Attack vectors": "Browsing to publicly accessible add-on application directories and the admin portal. Accessing the default credentials.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Network access to the device. Ability to browse to the publicly accessible 'setup complete' page and the add-on application directories."
