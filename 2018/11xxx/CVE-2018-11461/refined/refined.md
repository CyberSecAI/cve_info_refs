- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A vulnerability in the service command application allows for privilege escalation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The service command application is vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful attack can lead to a compromise of the system's confidentiality, integrity, and availability by allowing a user to gain elevated privileges, though not root.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local access to the affected systems.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs user-level privileges on the system but no user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability.
