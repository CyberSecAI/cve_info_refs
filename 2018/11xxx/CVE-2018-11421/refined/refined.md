- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Moxa OnCell G3100-HSPA Series devices use a proprietary monitoring protocol that does not provide confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity security controls. All information is sent in plain text.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Lack of confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity controls in the monitoring protocol.
    - Sensitive information transmitted in plain text.
    - Vulnerability to remote unauthenticated disclosure of sensitive information, including the administrator's password.
    - Potential for memory leaks which could lead to retrieval of additional information such as HTTP requests and previously used passwords.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - An attacker can intercept and modify plain text traffic.
    - An attacker can obtain sensitive information including the administrator's password.
    - An attacker may be able to retrieve additional information such as contents of HTTP requests and previously used passwords.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote unauthenticated network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker only requires network access to the vulnerable device. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
