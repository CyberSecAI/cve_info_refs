Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The forgotten password feature in YzmCMS allows a verification code to be used multiple times without refreshing the page.
*   The system gives different responses based on whether the username exists or not during the password reset process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Response Discrepancy Information Exposure:** The system reveals whether a username exists by providing distinct responses like "Username does not exist", "Email failed", or "Email sent successfully" during password reset.
*   **Insufficient Verification Code Lifetime:** The verification code used in the forgot password process remains valid for a long period, allowing for brute-force attempts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Account Hijacking:** Attackers can use the prolonged validity of the verification code to perform brute-force attacks and hijack user accounts.
*   **User Enumeration/Traversal:** Attackers can identify valid usernames by observing the different responses from the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability remotely by sending HTTP requests to the reset password page.
*   **Brute-force:** An attacker uses a dictionary of potential usernames to send multiple requests and identify valid usernames due to different response contents.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable `reset_email.html` page.
*   **Basic Knowledge of Web Requests:** The attacker should have basic knowledge of capturing and modifying HTTP requests (e.g., using tools like Burp Suite) to exploit the vulnerability.

**Summary**
This document describes a user enumeration vulnerability in YzmCMS due to different responses for valid and invalid user names in the password reset functionality. The verification code's long life enables brute force attacks.
