Bumps [shivammathur/setup-php](https://github.com/shivammathur/setup-php) from 2.29.0 to 2.32.0.

Release notes

*Sourced from [shivammathur/setup-php's releases](https://github.com/shivammathur/setup-php/releases).*

> ## 2.32.0
>
> ## Changelog
>
> * Added support for PHP 8.4 as the default stable PHP version.
>
> ```
> - name: Setup PHP
>   uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
> ```
>
> * Added support for PHP 8.5 as the nightly version. ([#867](https://redirect.github.com/shivammathur/setup-php/issues/867))
>
> ```
> - name: Setup PHP
>   uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
>   with:
>     php-version: '8.5'
> ```
>
> * Added support for `pre-installed` in `php-version` input. ([#872](https://redirect.github.com/shivammathur/setup-php/issues/872))
>   It will setup the pre-installed PHP version on the runner as per the docs here
>   <https://github.com/shivammathur/setup-php?tab=readme-ov-file#github-hosted-runners>. If the runner does not have a pre-installed PHP version, it will fail.
>   Please note: It is not recommended to use this unless you are doing something trivial, the pre-installed PHP versions on GitHub hosted runners are old patch versions.
>
> ```
> - name: Setup PHP
>   uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
>   with:
>     php-version: pre-installed
> ```
>
> * Added support for `.tool-versions` file format in `php-version-file` input. ([#883](https://redirect.github.com/shivammathur/setup-php/issues/883))
>   If you have an asdf .tool-versions file in your project.
>   For example, you can specify `.tool-versions` now in the `php-version-file` input and the action would setup the correct PHP version.
>
> ```
> ruby 3.4
> php 8.4
> nodejs 23.5
> ```
>
> ```
> - name: Setup PHP
>   uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
>   with:
>     php-version-file: .tool-versions
> ```
>
> * Added support for to specify the path for composer file in the project to read the PHP version using `COMPOSER_PROJECT_DIR` env value. ([#894](https://redirect.github.com/shivammathur/setup-php/issues/894))

### **[dependabot](/apps/dependabot) bot** commented on behalf of **github** [Jan 2, 2025](#issuecomment-2567449975)

| OK, I won't notify you again about this release, but will get in touch when a new version is available. If you'd rather skip all updates until the next major or minor version, let me know by commenting `@dependabot ignore this major version` or `@dependabot ignore this minor version`. You can also ignore all major, minor, or patch releases for a dependency by adding an [`ignore` condition](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates#ignore) with the desired `update_types` to your config file.  If you change your mind, just re-open this PR and I'll resolve any conflicts on it. |
