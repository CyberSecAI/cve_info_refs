The openSUSE 42.3 changed to end-of-life (EOL [1]) status. As such it is no longer maintained, which means that it will not receive any further security or bug fix updates. As a result we are closing this bug.  If you can reproduce this bug against a currently maintained version of  openSUSE (At this moment openSUSE Leap 15.1, 15.0 and Tumbleweed) please feel free to reopen this bug against that version (!you must update the "Version" component in the bug fields, do not just reopen please), or alternatively create a new ticket.  Thank you for reporting this bug and we are sorry it could not be fixed during the lifetime of the release.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=795740#c0)  Dhiraj    2018-05-02 07:57:22 UTC  ``` Hi Team,   While running bulk testcases(fuzzing) on epiphany Web 3.28.1 on Linux 4.15.0-20-generic.  The browser crashes, however running the testcase and browser on debug mode generate this error, below are the stack-trace for your reference.  Thread 15 "pool" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.  ```  + [Trace 238593](page.cgi?id=traceparser/trace.html&trace_id=238593)   | Thread 140735586760448 (LWP 3827)   * #0   ??   from   /usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/epiphany-browser/libephymain.so * #1   ??   from   /usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/libgio-2.0.so.0 * #2   ??   from   /usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/libglib-2.0.so.0 * #3   ??   from   /usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/libglib-2.0.so.0 * #4   start\_thread   at pthread\_create.c   line   463 * #5   clone   at ../sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/x86\_64/clone.S   line   95 | | --- |  ```   Request team to please look into this.

Unfortunately, that stack trace misses some elements that will help a lot to solve the problem, so it will be hard for the developers to fix that crash. Can you get us a full stack trace that includes debugging symbols? Please see <https://wiki.gnome.org/Community/GettingInTouch/Bugzilla/GettingTraces> for more information on how to do so and reopen this bug report. Thanks in advance!  And how to run the "Proof of concept"? It refers to files like "sleep_one_second.php" that we do not have. This task welcomes steps to reproduce. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=795740#c3)  Dhiraj    2018-05-02 09:21:01 UTC  ``` Thank you for looking into this. I was performing a blind fuzz so didn't look at the PoC which creates this crash. However,  I had a look on testcase for now where and have minimize it as well.  Steps to reproduce: 1. Open crash.html in Epiphany 2. It crashes  crash.html  <script> win = window.open("blah", "WIN"); </script>  Below is the stack trace for your reference.   Thread 15 "pool" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.  ```  + [Trace 238594](page.cgi?id=traceparser/trace.html&trace_id=238594)   | Thread 140735184115456 (LWP 2714)   * #0   ??   from   /usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/epiphany-browser/libephymain.so * #1   ??   from   /usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/libgio-2.0.so.0 * #2   ??   from   /usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/libglib-2.0.so.0 * #3   ??   from   /usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/libglib-2.0.so.0 * #4   start\_thread   at pthread\_create.c   line   463 * #5   clone   at ../sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/x86\_64/clone.S   line   95 | | --- |  ```    However, if the stack is still not visible, I have attached an txt file for same, hope this helps.
