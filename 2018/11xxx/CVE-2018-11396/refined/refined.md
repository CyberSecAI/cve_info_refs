Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-11396

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how GNOME Web (Epiphany) handles invalid URIs when opened via JavaScript. Specifically, the issue arises when a `window.open()` call attempts to open a URL that is NULL, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The core issue is that the code attempts to access a URL that is NULL, resulting in a segmentation fault and application crash. This occurs in `ephy-session.c`.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The browser fails to properly validate or handle cases where the URI passed to `window.open()` is invalid or NULL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by crafting malicious JavaScript code that triggers a crash of the Epiphany browser. This crash can be triggered by loading a specially crafted HTML file or by visiting a malicious website.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **JavaScript Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code into a website or deliver it through other means (e.g., malicious HTML file).
*   **Crafted `window.open()` Call:** The specific attack vector involves using the `window.open()` JavaScript function with an invalid or NULL URI as the target.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote:** The attacker can be remote and does not need direct access to the victim's machine.
*   **Ability to Inject JavaScript:** The attacker needs the ability to execute JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This could be through a malicious website or other means of code injection.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability does not require any form of authentication.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was initially reported with a simple Proof of Concept (PoC) involving `window.open("blah", "WIN")` where `blah` is treated as a potentially invalid URL.
*   A separate crash was also identified involving WebKitFaviconDatabase, triggered by a different PoC, demonstrating that multiple crashes could result from similar invalid URI handling issues.
*   The fix involved addressing the NULL URI access in `ephy-session.c`.
*   The issue was fixed in Epiphany version 3.28.3.
*   The vulnerability is considered a moderate security issue.
