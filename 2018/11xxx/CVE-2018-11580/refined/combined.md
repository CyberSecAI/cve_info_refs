Not sure why people complain about the small stuff (like having to manually ‚ÄòPublish‚Äô each page). This can obviously easily be done in the default WP page bulk edit area. Plus, who wants to immediately publish a gazillion pages anyway? Great plugin for doing EXACTLY what you would think it does.
Major thanks to the developer \m/

Folks complaining that this plugin won‚Äôt miraculously create content for them just don‚Äôt know how to use this plugin. I use a plugin called ‚Äútablepress‚Äù in conjunction with this plugin. Let‚Äôs suppose I have science website and want to quickly produce pages for each element in the periodic chart. I would use tablepress, which let‚Äôs you upload spreadsheets of data. Data which can be pulled from spreadsheets using talepress and placed into a webpage(s). You create you spreadsheet, each row in the spreadsheet has data for each different element, for instance, such as atomic weight, color, freezing point, etc. You will upload your spreadsheet into the tablepress plugin on your site. If you directly entered an exact address to a spreadsheet cell it would go like Column C, row 12 or C12. For your templet (plain text or notepad) that you are going to use for your mass content creation you enter the column for each different type of content such as weight, etc as C#row#. Column C is for the weight of every element. Column C5 could be for gold‚Äôs weight. Column C37 could be for uranium‚Äôs weight. When you enter your templet variable you enter them in a plain text page as C#row#. For example, for the info on the atomic weight of gold on my templet page you‚Äôd have for gold; Atomic Weight: [table 57, C5] That code calls spreadsheet number 57, column C, row 5. That‚Äôs not the exact format however, just an example. The reason ‚ÄòC‚Äô doesn‚Äôt change here is because the column being called for weights of elements is always from column C. You only change the rows for the different element weights. Now you will search the plain text page you created for #row# and change row to the element‚Äôs row number in the spreadsheet. Now you‚Äôve entered the specific address to all the data for the elements to be embedded into your content page. You mass produce 118 pages (the Number of elements) using this mass post/page plugin and paste in the completed templet with the different row for different elements. Then you paste that text into the mass produced pages. This mass page producer coupled with tablepress (free) would enable you to upload 118 pages 10 times faster than if you had to enter each variable manually.
The method I described above deals with calling individual spreadsheet cells to populate a webpage. Tablepress also has a very powerful filtering tool that searches for rows containing certain text and displays only that row. That can be used as well to create the content to mass produce wordpress posts.
Contact me if you have questions and I‚Äôll do my best to help you out.

Very limited free version. What is the point to have a bulk function to create pages/ posts if you have to publish them manually?
