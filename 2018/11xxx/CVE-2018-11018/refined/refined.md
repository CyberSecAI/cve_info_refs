The provided content describes a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in PbootCMS v1.0.7.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `RoleController.php` script, specifically that it lacks an anti-CSRF mechanism.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The application doesn't implement proper CSRF protection, making it susceptible to malicious requests initiated by an attacker on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to add new administrator accounts to the system, potentially leading to complete control over the affected PbootCMS instance.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack is carried out via a crafted HTML page (`evil.html`) containing a form that sends a POST request to the vulnerable `role/add.html` endpoint. This page would be hosted on an attacker-controlled server. The attack relies on tricking an authenticated administrator to click on the malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs to host a malicious HTML page.
   - The attacker must lure an authenticated administrator to click on the crafted malicious link.
   - The administrator must have an active session with PbootCMS.
   - No direct interaction with the server other than the crafted HTTP request is needed.
