- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap buffer overflow occurs in the `md_merge_lines()` function within the `md4c` library.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap buffer overflow. The `md_merge_lines()` function allocates a buffer, and then writes past the end of it due to an incorrect calculation of the required size.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The heap buffer overflow can lead to a crash or other undefined behavior, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted markdown file. The provided test case shows the input needed to cause the overflow.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to provide a malicious markdown file to an application that utilizes the vulnerable `md4c` library and parses the content.
