Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-11652:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a CSV injection flaw within the Nikto web server scanner. Specifically, the `Server` field within an HTTP response header is directly inserted into a CSV report generated by Nikto. This allows an attacker to inject malicious content into the CSV output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSV Injection:** The core weakness is the lack of sanitization of user-controlled input (the `Server` header) before it's written to a CSV file. This allows the injection of spreadsheet commands that can be executed when the CSV file is opened in a program like Microsoft Excel.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary OS Command Execution:** By crafting a malicious `Server` header, an attacker can execute arbitrary operating system commands when the victim opens the generated CSV file with vulnerable software (e.g. Microsoft Excel).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Response Header Manipulation:** The attack vector involves a malicious actor controlling the `Server` header of an HTTP response.
*   **Nikto CSV Report Generation:** The attacker needs to have a target system that Nikto scans, and Nikto needs to be configured to output the results to a CSV file.
*   **Victim Opens Malicious CSV:** The final step requires the victim to open the generated CSV file using spreadsheet software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Manipulate HTTP Response Headers:** The attacker must be able to control the `Server` header of an HTTP response sent by the targeted server (this could be achieved by compromising the server, performing a MITM attack, etc.).
*   **Targeted System Runs Nikto:** The attacker needs to know that their target is running Nikto and has the option to output CSV files.
*   **Social Engineering/Exploitation to open CSV:** The attacker needs a way to have the victim open the malicious CSV file.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit involves injecting a crafted string into the `Server` header, such as `=cmd|' /C calc'!'A1'`. When this is included in the CSV output and opened with a spreadsheet program, it will attempt to execute the command (in this example, opening calculator).
*   The vulnerability exists in Nikto versions 2.1.6 and earlier.
*   The fix involves prefixing cell data that starts with characters such as =, +, @, or - with a single quote ('). This prevents spreadsheet software from interpreting the cell content as a command.

**Mitigation:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in a commit by the maintainer of Nikto on June 1, 2018, which includes the `csv_safecell` function that sanitizes the input written into the CSV.
