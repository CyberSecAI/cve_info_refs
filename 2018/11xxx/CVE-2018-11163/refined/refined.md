{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing operating system commands. This allows for command injection through various parameters in the JSON-RPC API.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command [CWE-78]",
    "Execution with Unnecessary Privileges [CWE-250]"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution with root privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerabilities are exposed through the web application's JSON-RPC API. Attackers can send crafted requests to vulnerable methods.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
    "For unauthenticated command injection, no prior authentication is needed.",
    "For authenticated command injection, a valid session cookie is required.",
    "For privilege escalation, the attacker needs to have already achieved command injection and thus be able to run commands as the web server user."
