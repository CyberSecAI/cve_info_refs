Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-11013:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `websRedirect` function of the GoAhead web server on D-Link DIR-816 A2 (CN) routers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The `websRedirect` function copies the content of the HTTP Host header to a stack buffer without proper bounds checking. This lack of input validation allows an attacker to overwrite data on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- By sending a crafted HTTP request with an overly long Host header, an attacker can overwrite the return address on the stack and gain control of the program counter ($pc register). This allows for arbitrary code execution on the affected device.
- Successful exploitation can lead to a reverse shell, giving the attacker remote access to the router.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a GET request to the `/sharefile` endpoint with an excessively long HTTP Host header.
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by unauthenticated attackers. The router's web interface must be accessible either via the local WiFi or through the internet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have network access to the router's web interface.
- No prior authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker must be able to send a crafted HTTP GET request with a long Host header.
