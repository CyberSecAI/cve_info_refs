DSA-2018-136: Dell EMC Integrated Data Protection Appliance Undocumented Accounts Vulnerability

Dell EMC Identifier DSA-2018-136

CVE Identifier CVE-2018-11062

Severity: High

CVSSv3 Base Score: 8.6 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L)

Affected products:

Dell EMC Integrated Data Protection Appliance 2.0

Dell EMC Integrated Data Protection Appliance 2.1

Dell EMC Integrated Data Protection Appliance 2.2

Summary:

Integrated Data Protection Appliance (iDPA) contains undocumented accounts with limited access which may potentially be
used by a malicious user to compromise the affected system.

Details:

Integrated Data Protection Appliance versions 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2 contain undocumented accounts named "support" and
"admin" that are protected with default passwords. These accounts have limited privileges and can access certain system
files only. A malicious user with the knowledge of the default passwords may potentially log in to the system and gain
read and write access to certain system files.

Resolution:

Follow the steps below to remove the user accounts named "support" and "admin" from the impacted virtual machines in
the Integrated Data Protection Appliance. There is no loss of supportability or any other product functionality as a
result of the removal of these accounts.

Log in to Data Protection Advisor - Datastore Server Virtual Machine using an SSH client such as PuTTY, as root user
and execute the following commands:

Delete the user "support"

userdel support

Delete the user "admin"

userdel admin

Verify that the accounts are deleted. The following commands should display "no such user" as the output.

id support

id admin

For Integrated Data Protection Appliance 2.0 and 2.1, repeat the above procedure for Data Protection Advisor -
Application server, Data Protection Advisor - Agent, Data Protection Advisor - DD Data Processor Tool and Appliance
Configuration Manager Virtual Machines.

For Integrated Data Protection Appliance 2.2, repeat the above procedure for Data Protection Advisor - Application
Server and Appliance Configuration Manager Virtual Machines.
