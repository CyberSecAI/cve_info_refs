{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper neutralization of special elements used in OS commands. The application's JSON-RPC API does not properly sanitize user-supplied parameters before using them in OS commands.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Command injection (CWE-78)",
    "Execution with unnecessary privileges (CWE-250)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary system commands on the appliance with root permissions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerabilities are exposed through the web interface's JSON-RPC API. Attackers can send specially crafted JSON requests to trigger the vulnerabilities.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker can exploit some of the vulnerabilities without authentication. Others require a valid authentication token. The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable appliance."
