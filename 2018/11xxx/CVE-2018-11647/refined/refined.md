Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-11647:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper encoding of input values used by `oauth2orize-fprm` before they are placed into HTML context. Specifically, the code was not encoding non-string values.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists because user-controlled input parameters were not properly encoded before being included in the HTML output. This allowed for HTML injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the web page, which would be executed in the victim's browser. This could lead to:
    *   Sensitive information disclosure
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Further unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim
    *   Potential redirection to malicious sites

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a crafted URL containing malicious input values that are not properly encoded by the `oauth2orize-fprm` library, resulting in the injection of HTML.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL. They need to trick a user into clicking on this crafted URL, making this a reflected XSS.

**Additional details:**
The provided content also includes a fix for this vulnerability which includes encoding values that are not strings to prevent HTML injection. The fix was included in version 0.2.1 of the library.
