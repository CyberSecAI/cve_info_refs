Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the described session management issue:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is improper session management in the Monstra CMS administration panel. Specifically, the application does not invalidate existing user sessions after a password change. This allows an attacker with an active session to continue using that session even after the legitimate user changes their password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Session Invalidation:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of session invalidation upon password change. When a user changes their password, the existing session remains valid, which should not be the case.
*   **Inadequate Authentication Checks:** The application doesn't enforce re-authentication after password changes when users attempt to make other changes. This lack of verification opens the door for unauthorized actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Account Takeover:** An attacker who has an active session before the password change can retain access and control the victim's account, including editing or adding information.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The attacker can potentially modify user data, including configurations, content, or user profiles, without the victim being able to stop them through password change.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can access sensitive administration functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Multiple Browsers/Sessions:** The attack can be executed using two browsers, one used by the legitimate user and the other used by an attacker or by the same user with two sessions.
*   **Session Hijacking:** If an attacker has previously managed to get access to a valid session (e.g., by sniffing a cookie or malware) they can use that session without needing to know the current password even after a password change.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Initial Access:** The attacker needs to have an existing valid session on the victim's account in the administrative panel. This could be through direct login, session hijacking, or other means to have a valid active session.
*   **Persistence:** Once an attacker obtains a valid session before the user changes their password, they can exploit the vulnerability without requiring the new password.

**Summary:**

This issue details a session management flaw where the application fails to invalidate user sessions after a password change, enabling unauthorized access by users with pre-existing active sessions. An attacker, by exploiting this flaw, can retain control of an account even if the legitimate user changes the password.
