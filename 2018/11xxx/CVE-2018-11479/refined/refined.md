{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Windscribe VPN service creates a named pipe without proper validation of the program name in the command line, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with SYSTEM privileges.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Privilege escalation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges on a vulnerable system, allowing for complete control over the machine. This could lead to data theft, malware installation, and other malicious activities.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access required to connect to the named pipe"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to connect to the named pipe created by the Windscribe service. This requires local access to the vulnerable machine. The attacker would also need to craft a specially formatted payload containing the malicious command to be executed.  The vulnerability is exploitable by a standard user on the machine."
