    "Description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the addAdLayer method. By performing actions in JavaScript, an attacker can trigger a type confusion condition. The attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.",
    "Root cause": "Type confusion condition triggered in the `addAdLayer` method when executing certain JavaScript.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Type confusion"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution under the context of the current process.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Visiting a malicious page",
      "Opening a malicious file"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious PDF file or a webpage with embedded malicious JavaScript that triggers the type confusion vulnerability."
