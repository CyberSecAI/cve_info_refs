Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2018-11537:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `angular-jwt` library's domain allowlisting feature was vulnerable due to the library treating the `whiteListedDomains` entries as regular expressions, causing a `.` (dot) separator to match any character.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Allow List Bypass:** The domain allowlist, intended to restrict which domains the JWT is sent to, could be bypassed.
- **Incorrect Regular Expression Handling:** The library incorrectly treated domain strings as regex, where `.` was interpreted as "any character" instead of a literal dot.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially send JWTs to unauthorized domains by crafting a domain name that matches the allow list regex due to the "any character" interpretation of the dot. This could leak sensitive JWT tokens.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker sets up a domain, that due to the regex interpretation by the vulnerable library, bypasses the allow list. For instance, if `whitelisted.example.com` is whitelisted, `whitelistedXexample.com` would also pass the filter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to set up a domain that can be used to impersonate a whitelisted domain according to the flawed regex logic.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability affects versions of `angular-jwt` prior to `0.1.10`.
- The fix is to upgrade to version `0.1.10` or later.
- The library maintainers recommend updating `package.json` to allow patch and minor updates.
- The official advisory notes that the fix patches the library and will not impact users, their current state, or existing sessions.
