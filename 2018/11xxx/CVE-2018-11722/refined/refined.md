```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses a hardcoded `UC_KEY` to encrypt and decrypt data. This allows an attacker to craft malicious payloads by encrypting crafted parameters, leading to a SQL injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection",
    "Use of hardcoded cryptographic key",
    "Insufficient input validation"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database by injecting malicious SQL into the `username` parameter. This could lead to data exfiltration, modification, or complete compromise of the database.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted request to the `/api/uc.php` endpoint with a malicious `code` parameter. The `code` parameter is crafted by encrypting malicious parameters using the hardcoded key.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must know the hardcoded `UC_KEY`, which is disclosed in the report as `e063rbkHX22RAvIg`. They can then craft malicious code parameters with SQL injection payloads and send it to the affected endpoint. "
