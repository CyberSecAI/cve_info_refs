- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Heap-buffer-overflow (out-of-bounds read) in the `Sass::Prelexer::exactly` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow, which results in an out-of-bounds read. This occurs within the `Sass::Prelexer::exactly` function, specifically at `libsass/src/lexer.hpp:93:14`.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An out-of-bounds read can lead to a crash or potentially allow an attacker to read sensitive information from memory.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by specially crafted input files (PoC files provided in the link), which are processed by the libsass library.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to provide malicious input to libsass that triggers the vulnerable code path in `Sass::Prelexer::exactly`. This might involve crafting a specific Sass file or providing input through a user interface that uses libsass.
