Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-11195:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the insecure design of the Mahara web application, which does not properly handle browser history and the resubmission of form data. Specifically, it is caused by the application's failure to prevent the browser from resubmitting login credentials when using the back, forward, or refresh buttons after a user has logged out.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Handling of Browser History:** The application allows the browser to retain login form data in its history.
*   **Lack of Redirection After Logout:** The application doesn't redirect users to a neutral page after logging out, leaving the login page vulnerable to resubmission.
*   **Vulnerable to Browser Back/Forward/Refresh:** The vulnerability is exploitable through the browser's back, forward, and refresh buttons.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:**  An attacker with physical access to a logged-out user's browser can potentially access the user's Mahara credentials. This is because the browser's history may contain the login data, which is then resubmitted to the server upon using the back/forward/refresh functionality.
*   **Credential Theft:** Successfully exploiting this vulnerability would result in an attacker obtaining the username and password of a previous user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical Access:** The attacker requires physical access to the web browser of a Mahara user who has previously logged in and then logged out.
*   **Browser's Back/Forward/Refresh Buttons:** The attacker exploits these browser functionalities to resubmit stored login credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical access to a computer where a user was previously logged into Mahara.** The attacker needs to be able to access the browser history on a computer used by a previous Mahara user.
*   **Basic knowledge of browser functionality.** The attacker needs to know how to use the browser back, forward, and refresh buttons.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Mahara versions 17.04 before 17.04.8, 17.10 before 17.10.5, and 18.04 before 18.04.1 are vulnerable.
*   **Proposed Solution:** The suggested fix involves using an intermediate page that redirects the user to the actual destination page after successful authentication via an "HTTP Redirect command". This prevents the browser from resubmitting the login data directly.
*   **Mahara Mobile:** The fix should also work on the mobile version of Mahara.
