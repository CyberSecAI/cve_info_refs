Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-11506:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the Linux kernel's CDROM driver, specifically within the `sr_do_ioctl` function in `drivers/scsi/sr_ioctl.c`.
*   The root cause is that the code was casting the CDROM layer's `request_sense` buffer (64 bytes) to the SCSI sense buffer (96 bytes) without properly allocating space for the larger buffer. Because these buffers were generally allocated on the stack, this resulted in stack corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The primary weakness is the ability to write past the end of a stack-allocated buffer. This occurs when the CDROM driver attempts to handle SCSI sense data that is larger than the allocated buffer, leading to the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most immediate impact is a system crash due to stack corruption.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Possible):** While not explicitly confirmed, there's a possibility that exploiting this overflow could allow for arbitrary code execution by overwriting return addresses on the stack.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local attacker:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
*   **Access to SCSI optical disc device:** The attacker needs access to a SCSI optical disc device that can produce more than 64 bytes of sense data.
*   **Malicious sense data:** The attacker triggers the vulnerability by forcing the SCSI device to return more than 64 bytes of sense data, leading to the overflow during the `request_sense` operation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   A local user on the system
*   Must have access to an optical disc device through the sr (SCSI CDROM) driver.
*   Must be able to cause the device to return more than 64 bytes of sense data through some operation.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by inconsistent buffer sizes between the CDROM and SCSI layers of the kernel's block device subsystem.
*   The fix involved allocating a properly-sized 96 byte buffer and copying sense information back to the original (smaller) buffer if one was provided by the CDROM layer.
*   This vulnerability was reported by Piotr Gabriel Kosinski and Daniel Shapira, and fixed by Jens Axboe.
