Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-11790:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an arithmetic overflow and wrap-around during string length calculation within Apache OpenOffice. This occurs when loading a document with smaller end-of-line termination characters than the operating system uses.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Arithmetic overflow: The software incorrectly calculates the length of a string due to an integer overflow, which leads to a buffer overflow.
- Potential memory corruption: The incorrect length calculation can lead to writing past the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   The vulnerability can lead to a crash of the application, and possibly arbitrary code execution

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves a specially crafted document. When the crafted document is loaded by Apache OpenOffice, it triggers the overflow during string length calculation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted document that exploits the vulnerability.
- The attacker would need to trick a user into opening the malicious document in a vulnerable version of Apache OpenOffice.

**Additional Details:**

- A proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstration of the vulnerability exists, as referenced by a link to ssd-disclosure.
- The vulnerability affects Apache OpenOffice versions 4.1.5 and older.
- It also affects older OpenOffice.org versions
- The fix is available in Apache OpenOffice version 4.1.6.
- Ubuntu also released a fix for LibreOffice which included this CVE.
