Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The mySCADA myPRO 7 software has a hardcoded FTP username and password ("myscada:Vikuk63") embedded within its source code. This allows unauthorized access to the FTP server running on port 2121 of the software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The primary vulnerability is the use of hardcoded credentials for the FTP server.
*   **Insecure FTP:** The FTP server runs on port 2121 and allows remote connections with the hardcoded credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain access to the myPRO system via FTP.
*   **File Manipulation:** Once connected, attackers can upload, download, and modify files on the server. This could lead to:
    *   **Data theft:** Sensitive data could be stolen.
    *   **Malware Installation:** Malicious files could be uploaded.
    *   **System Compromise:**  Uploaded files could be used to compromise the system and disrupt industrial processes.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the myPRO server to connect to the FTP service.
*   **FTP Client:** The attacker needs to use an FTP client.
*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The attacker will use the hardcoded username and password ("myscada:Vikuk63").

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Connectivity:** Must have network connectivity to the target system running myPRO.
*   **FTP Client:** Must have an FTP client installed and know the hardcoded credentials.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know about the hardcoded credentials.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability is present in myPRO version 7 and affects all supported platforms (Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux).
* The vendor has released a fix in version 7.0.46 that disables the download of project files using the FTP protocol, switching to a secure SSL channel.
* A workaround before the patch was to restrict access to port 2121 from the outside to mitigate the issue.
