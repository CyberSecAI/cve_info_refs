Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-11730:

**CVE-2018-11730**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a double-free error located in the `libfsntfs_security_descriptor_values_free` function within the libfsntfs library.
*   **Vulnerability:** The vulnerability occurs when the function `libfsntfs_security_descriptor_values_free` attempts to free the same memory block twice, leading to a double-free condition.
*   **Impact:** Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a crafted NTFS file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a maliciously crafted NTFS file to the vulnerable application using the libfsntfs library.

**Technical Details:**
The provided crash information shows that the double-free occurs on a memory region at address `0x62b000000200`. This address is freed in `libfsntfs_security_descriptor_values_free` and was previously freed in `libfsntfs_security_descriptor_values_read_stream`. The call stack shows that the vulnerability is triggered when reading an NTFS file using `fsntfsinfo` tool. The `libfsntfs_attribute_read_value` function calls `libfsntfs_security_descriptor_values_read_stream`, which allocates and frees a memory region, and later, `libfsntfs_security_descriptor_values_free` attempts to free the same memory again.
