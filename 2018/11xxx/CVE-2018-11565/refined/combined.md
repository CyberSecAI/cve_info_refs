![Continuous single line drawing of a person working on a laptop](https://mahara.org/theme/mahara-org/images/dashboard-person-desktop.svg)

## Create portfolios

Using Mahara, students and staff create their personal learning stories by uploading evidence of activities they have participated in, and embedding publicly accessible content they have previously put online. They can write reflections on their experiences that frame this evidence, map it to competencies or registration requirements, and provide necessary context.

Mahara can be used for many different portfolio purposes, such as study, professional development, work-integrated learning, assessment, showcase and presentation, and employability.

[Learn about the portfolio options](https://mahara.org/view/view.php?id=137010)

## Share work

Mahara allows portfolios to be shared flexibly with one person, a specific group of people, or the entire world. Access can be further restricted to a particular time frame or just within an assessment task.

[Find out about sharing portfolios](https://mahara.org/view/view.php?id=137011)

![Continuous single line drawing of a group of people sitting around a laptop in discussion](https://mahara.org/theme/mahara-org/images/dashboard-group-desktop.svg)

## Engage with others

Mahara makes it easy to comment and give feedback. Portfolios can also be submitted to learning management systems via LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) for marking.

Groups in Mahara allow people to create portfolios collaboratively and engage in forum discussions.
