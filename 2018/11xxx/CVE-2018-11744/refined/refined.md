{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The ZooKeeper service's JMX port did not support mutual TLS authentication, allowing potential eavesdropping and modification of data on that port.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of mutual TLS authentication on ZooKeeper JMX port",
      "Reliance on password-based authentication with known weaknesses"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful attack may leak data, cause denial of service, or even allow arbitrary code execution on the Java process that exposes a JMX port.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network access to the ZooKeeper JMX port."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker with network access to the ZooKeeper JMX port can potentially eavesdrop and modify packets. May potentially also perform arbitrary code execution on the java process exposing JMX if able to successfully exploit the JMX authentication bypass or other vulnerabilities.",
