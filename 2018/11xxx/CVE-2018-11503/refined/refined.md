Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-11503:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `discount` library, which is an implementation of the Markdown markup language. The vulnerability occurs when processing specially crafted Markdown data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow, where the program attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer on the heap. Specifically, the `__mkd_trim_line` function, called during code block parsing, was identified as a vulnerable point.  The overflow is triggered during a `memmove` operation within `__mkd_trim_line`.
*   The provided AddressSanitizer output indicates a `READ` of 103 bytes at memory address `0x60b00000a91a` when the allocated region was from `[0x60b00000a8b0,0x60b00000a91a)`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service by causing `discount` to crash due to reading beyond the end of its internal buffers. This is primarily due to a heap-buffer-over-read.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially crafted Markdown data:** The attack vector is through malicious markdown input files containing crafted sequences that trigger the overflow, as demonstrated by the provided test case (`issue1_testcase`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide or control the input of a markdown document that is processed by the vulnerable `discount` library. This could be achieved through various means, such as:
    *   Uploading a specially crafted markdown file to a server that uses the `discount` library
    *   Providing crafted markdown content through an application using the library
    *   Any other means where user-controlled markdown gets processed.
* No special privileges are required for exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information includes a stack trace that points to the specific function calls leading to the buffer overflow: `main` -> `mkd_compile` -> `compile_document` -> `compile` -> `codeblock` -> `__mkd_trim_line`.
*   The vulnerability is addressed in `discount` version `2.2.2-1+deb9u1` for Debian stretch and `2.1.7-1+deb8u1` for Debian Jessie.
*   The issue was initially reported on Github as issue #189.
*   Multiple CVEs were fixed in the same patch, not just this one: CVE-2018-11468, CVE-2018-11503, CVE-2018-11504 and CVE-2018-12495.

This analysis is based on the detailed information provided in the Debian security advisories, Github issue, and the provided AddressSanitizer output.
