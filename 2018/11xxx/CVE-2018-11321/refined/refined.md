The provided content is related to CVE-2018-11321.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Inadequate filtering of user-supplied input when creating custom fields within the `com_fields` component of Joomla. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization of filtering options, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient input validation and sanitization.
- Remote Code Execution vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker with the authorization to create custom fields can exploit the vulnerability to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.

**Attack vectors:** An attacker with the required privileges could inject malicious code through the filtering options of custom fields.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authorized to create custom fields in the Joomla CMS. This implies the attacker needs to have administrative or other privileged access to the Joomla backend.
