```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper neutralization of special elements used in OS commands. The Quest DR Series Disk Backup software's web interface exposes a JSON-RPC API. Several API methods use user-supplied parameters to construct OS commands without proper sanitization, allowing for command injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (CWE-78)",
    "Execution with Unnecessary Privileges (CWE-250)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands with root privileges on the affected appliance.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vectors are through the exposed JSON-RPC API of the web interface. The vulnerabilities can be exploited both remotely and locally.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An unauthenticated attacker can exploit a command injection vulnerability in the login method. Authenticated attackers can exploit command injection vulnerabilities in other methods.  Initial access to the web interface and knowledge of the API is necessary."
