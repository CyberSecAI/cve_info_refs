## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## [G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

### [2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos](#2-github-trademarks-and-logos)

If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: <https://github.com/logos>.

### [3. License to GitHub Policies](#3-license-to-github-policies)

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## [I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## [J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

## [K. Payment](#k-payment)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.*

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### [4. Authorization](#4-authorization)

By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.

### [5. Responsibility for Payment](#5-responsibility-for-payment)

You are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service. If you dispute the matter, contact us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/). You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for paid Accounts. Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

## [L. Cancellation and Termination](#l-cancellation-and-termination)

**Short version:** *You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.*

### [1. Account Cancellation](#1-account-cancellation)

You can [cancel your Account at any time](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

GitHub has the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. GitHub reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation.

Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement.

GitHub does not warrant that the Service will meet your requirements; that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; that the information provided through the Service is accurate, reliable or correct; that any defects or errors will be corrected; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components.

## [O. Limitation of Liability](#o-limitation-of-liability)

**Short version:** *We will not be liable for damages or losses arising from your use or inability to use the service or otherwise arising under this agreement. Please read this section carefully; it limits our obligations to you.*

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

* the use, disclosure, or display of your User-Generated Content;
* your use or inability to use the Service;
* any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service;
* the Service generally or the software or systems that make the Service available;

* statements or conduct of any third party on the Service;
* any other user interactions that you input or receive through your use of the Service; or
* any other matter relating to the Service.

Our liability is limited whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy set forth in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose. We will have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond our reasonable control.

## [P. Release and Indemnification](#p-release-and-indemnification)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for your use of the service. If you harm someone else or get into a dispute with someone else, we will not be involved.*

If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you agree to release GitHub from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

## [Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, such as price increases, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website or sending email to the primary email address specified in your GitHub account. Customer's continued use of the Service after those 30 days constitutes agreement to those revisions of this Agreement. For any other modifications, your continued use of the Website constitutes agreement to our revisions of these Terms of Service. You can view all changes to these Terms in our [Site Policy](https://github.com/github/site-policy) repository.

We reserve the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Website (or any part of it) with or without notice.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

# dtSearch Release Notes

**Disclaimer**: This information is provided subject to the license agreement accompanying the products
described and to the **[terms of use](http://www.dtsearch.com/TermsOfUse.html)** of this web site,
and does not constitute an additional warranty. dtSearch makes no warranty of any kind with regard to this
information.
## dtSearch 2025.01 (Build 8834 ) Sun 01/19/2025

### Fixes/Minor Enhancements

* Fixed: Some users unable to use Edit > Copy in dtSearch Desktop to copy text from the preview window.
* File parser bug fixes affecting: TAR, HWP, PDF
* Other bug fixes

## dtSearch 2024.02 (Build 8821) Released September 30, 2024

### All Products

* *Multithreaded Indexing*
  Added support for building indexes using multiple threads, greatly improving
  indexing speed on 64-bit Windows and Linux systems with multiple cores. At least 16 Gb of memory is
  required.
   In dtSearch Desktop/Network, click Options > Preferences > Indexing Resources to enable this
  option.
   For information on using multithreaded indexing in the API, please see  [Multithreaded Operations](https://support.dtsearch.com/faq/dts0233.htm) .
   Multithreaded indexing had
  previously been available as a "preview" feature.

### Fixes/Minor Enhancements

* Updated included Zlib version to 1.3.1, Unrar to 7.1, and ICU to 74.2 (Windows and Linux).
* Fixed dtSearch Desktop Options > Preferences > Search Results bug causing the Column Sizes setting not to
  be remembered if the compact resizable version of the Preferences dialog box is enabled
* In documents with footnotes, added a link back to the footnote reference to the footnote text.
* Fixed .NET Core API bug causing the IndexInfo.Flags property not to be populated.
* File parser bug fixes affecting: PDF, WordPerfect
* Other bug fixes

## dtSearch 2024.01 (Build 8815) Released March 30, 2024

### dtSearch Desktop/Network

* Accessibility improvements:
  + New "Accessibility Options" page in Options > Preferences with options to improve operation of
    dtSearch with screen readers.
  + New optional compact resizable dialog boxes, which you can enable or disable in the Accessibility
    Options page. At high text magnification levels, the standard dtSearch dialog boxes can be too large
    to work with. By default, dtSearch will use compact resizable dialog boxes in this situation, which
    can be resized and are organized to take up less screen space.
  + "Make text larger" setting in Windows is now recognized and applied to menus, search results, dialog
    boxes, and default document window zoom. The application must be closed and restarted for the change
    to take effect. This is an alternative to the existing option to directly control the dialog box
    font size in Options > Dialog Box Font Size.
  + To provide better keyboard navigation among the dtSearch Search components (the menu, the Search
    dialog box, the list of search results, the document and the Document Information sidebar window),
    new keyboard shortcuts and menu options have been added to provide direct navigation using the
    keyboard. Menu options corresponding to these shortcuts are in View > Go to window. The keyboard
    shortcuts are: Ctrl+Alt+M - Main menu. Ctrl+Alt+D - Document, Ctrl+Alt+R - Search results, Ctrl+Y -
    Document info, Ctrl+S - Search dialog box).
  + Easier tab navigation of the Options > Preferences dialog box* New minimum system requirements: Windows versions 8 through 11 and Windows Server versions 2012 and later.

### dtSearch Engine

* Added arm64 and arm64ec versions of the dtSearch Engine DLL for Windows. Unlike the x64 version, the arm64
  and arm64ec versions include the [crypto-enabled
  PDF file parser](https://support.dtsearch.com/webhelp/dtSearchCppApi/Installing_the_dtSearch_Engine.html#:~:text=Export%20Notice%20and%20Encryption%C2%A0). The arm64 and arm64ec versions use the same C++ API as the x64 version.

### Fixes/Minor Enhancements

* Added support for GPS metadata (latitude, longitude, altitude) in JPG files
* File parser bug fixes affecting PPTX (["modern
  comments"](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/modern-comments-in-powerpoint-c0aa37bb-82cb-414c-872d-178946ff60ec) support added), PDF
* Other bug fixes

## dtSearch 2023.02 (Build 8806) Released October 24, 2023

### All Products

* Image/Sound/Video metadata improvements: Added new file format support for OGG (Vorbis metadata), OPUS
  (Vorbis metadata), FLAC (Vorbis metadata), WAV (RIFF and XMP metadata), AIFF (RIFF and XMP metadata), WEBP
  (RIFF and XMP metadata), AVI (RIFF and XMP metadata), HEIF (EXIF and XMP metadata), APE (APEv2 and XMP
  metadata), PNG (XMP, IPTC, and EXIF metadata), GIF (XMP metadata). Added XMP to existing metadata support
  for MP4, TIF, MP3, MOV, WMA/WMV. Image files continue to have an "Image Format" field that specifies the
  file format and categories of metadata found (EXIF, IPTC, XMP, etc.). Sound and video files have a new
  "Media Format" field with this information.

### dtSearch Engine

* Added sample code demonstrating use of the dtSearch Engine in an ASP.NET Core application running in a
  Docker container under Windows (NanoServer) and Linux. See the [dtsearch]\examples\Docker folder and the
  readme-dtSearch-docker.md file in the application folders.
* Added sample code demonstrating how to build NuGet packages to deploy the dtSearch Engine with associated
  dependencies including ICU, CMAP files, stemming rules, and the external file parsers. See the
  [dtsearch]\examples\NuGet folder.
* Added to C++ API: dtssGetIndexInfo2, which is the same as dtssGetIndexInfo but also provides an error code
  and diagnostic message when an index cannot be accessed.

### Fixes/Minor Enhancements

* Updated RAR file parser to the current version of the Rarlab source (6.2.10 released August 1, 2023).
  dtSearch uses source code from Rarlab to implement content extraction from RAR archives.
   Note: [Rarlab reports](https://rarlab.com/rarnew.htm) that the updated source fixes two security
  vulnerabilities. Based on information available about vulnerabilities, we do not believe they affect any
  dtSearch product.
  (1) CVE-2023-40477 (out of bounds write) affects RAR recovery volumes. RAR recovery
  volumes have a .rev extension and a different binary header from RAR archives, so dtSearch will not invoke
  the RAR file processing code if it encounters a RAR4 recovery volume. Additionally, the code to process
  recovery volumes is disabled in the RAR extraction code that dtSearch uses. This [Rarlab article](https://www.rarlab.com/vuln_rev3_names.html) states that unrar.dll is not
  affected by the vulnerability, and the unrar.dll source code is what dtSearch uses in its RAR file
  parser.
  (2) CVE-2023-38831 (launching of an incorrect file) is associated with the WinRAR user interface
  and does not affect dtSearch.
* dtSearch Desktop Index Manager index properties window displays open error message instead of blank index
  properties when an index cannot be opened
* Fixed search performance bug that could cause reduced search speed during phrase searches involving
  extremely large documents
* Fixed incorrect handling of the Unicode soft hyphen character (U+00AD), which should be ignored during
  searches because it is not indexed.
* Fixed bug that could cause duplicate field name errors when documents include field names with certain CJK
  diacritical characters. Verifying an index will indicate if an index is affected. Affected indexes should be
  rebuilt.
* Text log files history.ix, dtSearchIndexingHistory.log, and indexlog.dat now format dates YYYY/MM/DD instead
  of MM/DD/YYYY
* File parser bug fixes affecting: DOCX, PDF
* In dtSearch Desktop the Options > Create group policy dialog creates an MSI file that places the registry
  keys under HKMU instead of HKCU or HKLM, so you can control at installation time whether the installation is
  per-user or per-machine. To install per-machine, specify ALLUSERS=2 and run the .msi with administrator
  permissions.
* Fixed time zone bug in the Linux indexer causing documents to be reindexed unnecessarily during an
  incremental index update.
* Added option in dtSearch Desktop in Options > Preferences > Indexing Resources to "Ask Windows to keep
  computer awake during indexing" (to prevent automatic sleep from blocking scheduled updates)./li>* Other bug fixes

## dtSearch 2023.01 (Build 8790) Released June 5, 2023

### dtSearch Desktop/Network

* New search results control. Improvements include:
  + Long text can wrap within columns
  + "First hits in context" display is faster and more efficient, and now appears in a wrapped column
    instead of a separate row.
  + Improved sorting performance
  + Updated appearance
  + Right-click any column header to quickly access search results format functions
  + ![Fit-Content/Fit-Window toggle button](data:image/png;base64...)
    Click a toolbar button or press Ctrl+Num-/ to toggle between "Fit-Content" and "Fit-Window" mode.
  + The old control is still available -- check the box to "Use older dtSearch 7.x search results
    control" in Options > Preferences > Search Results.* Added an option in Options > Preferences > Document Display to control whether HTML files are displayed with
    a <base> tag referencing the original document location. Enable this option to make relative links to
    other files or images stored with the original document work in search results. However, this will also
    cause internal bookmark links in the document to also reference the original file rather than the
    hit-highlighted version.

### dtSearch Engine

* WebDemo sample ASP.NET Core application updated to support configuring multiple search forms using the
  appSettings.json file

### Fixes/Minor Enhancements

* Fixed bug in beta/preview multithreaded indexer that could cause deleted documents not to be removed from an
  index during an update.
* Fixed bug in dtSearch Desktop in the old 7.x search results control causing misalignment of data in search
  results columns after repositioning a column.
* Fixed bug causing out-of-memory error verifying an index
* File parser bug fixes affecting: PDF, MSG
* Other bug fixes

## dtSearch 2022.02 (Build 8775) Released December 1, 2022

### dtSearch Desktop/Network

* Added built-in stemming rules and noise word lists for over 25 European languages.
* Added option in Search dialog box to select language to use for stemming.
* Added option in Options > Preferences > Letters and Words to select language to use for noise words.
* Added option in Options > Preferences > Indexing Resources to control number of threads used for
  multi-threaded indexing

### dtSearch Engine

* WebDemo sample ASP.NET Core application updated to require .NET Core 6 and current versions of Bootstrap and
  JQuery
* Stemming rules and noise word lists for over 25 European languages are included in the dtSearch Data folder.

### Fixes/Minor Enhancements

* Updated zlib source code to 1.12.13. Note: Zlib reports that this version fixed zlib CVE-2022-37434 ("zlib
  through 1.2.12 has a heap-based buffer over-read or buffer overflow in inflate in inflate.c via a large gzip
  header extra field. NOTE: only applications that call inflateGetHeader are affected. Some common
  applications bundle the affected zlib source code but may be unable to call inflateGetHeader"). dtSearch
  does not use the inflateGetHeader function so based on this information we do not believe this vulnerability
  affected any dtSearch products.
* Fixed bug in beta/preview multithreaded indexer that could cause a corrupt index to be generated if the
  underscore character is changed to a word break character in the alphabet settings.
* Fixed dtSearch Desktop search dialog box bug causing search dialog box to close when a search finds no
  documents.
* Fixed dtSearch Desktop search dialog box bug causing "More search options" dialog box to clear all criteria
  from previous search between searches.
* Fixed dtSearch Desktop search results display causing modification times to incorrectly reflect daylight
  savings times (earlier or later by one hour)
* Improved View > Document Information display, shown as a dockable sidebar instead of a pop-up and with
  better formatting of information.
* File parser bug fixes affecting: DOCX, WordStar, PDF
* Exceptions thrown from .NET 4.x DataSource API DocStream objects previously would fail the associated I/O
  operation after a retry; now any detected exceptions will immediately fail the document and report it
  through IIndexStatusHandler and WasDocError.
* Other bug fixes

## dtSearch 2022.01 (Build 8749) Released May 17, 2022

* **This version updates the zlib compression/decompression library code in dtSearch to the new zlib version
  1.2.12 to remedy a reported memory corruption vulnerability in the zlib library.** For more
  information see [nvd.nist.gov](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-25032).* The zlib update affects the Windows, Linux and macOS versions of dtSearch products.* Zlib is a library of code that is used very widely in software products to implement ZIP-compatible
      compression and decompression. For more information about zlib, please see [zlib.net](https://zlib.net/).* dtSearch uses zlib for decompression of zip-compressed data in ZIP files and other formats such as PDF and
        Office that use zlib-compatible compression. dtSearch also uses zlib to compress documents and
        internally-generated data when caching text and documents in an index and when indexing PDF files.* Because the zlib vulnerability could affect dtSearch products if used to index maliciously-created content,
          this update is recommended for all users.

## dtSearch 2022.01 (Build 8748) Released May 2, 2022

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* Added new command-line options for dtSearch Desktop to simplify network deployment and suppress startup
  prompts: /agreetolicense (agree to license agreement), /dirstd (use standard data folder), /sn (specify
  serial number), and /noupd (suppress update checking).
* Fixed index creation failure when targeting a Samba network share due to delayed lock release.
* Reduced memory use when processing very large Excel pivot tables.
* File parser bug fixes affecting: PST, MSG, PDF, MP4
* Other bug fixes

## dtSearch 2021.02 (Build 8733) Released December 31, 2021

* Fixed: Clicking "Add Folder" in the 64-bit dtSearch Indexer closed the indexer on some machines. Based on
  analysis in the linked articles below, this appears to have been due to an interaction between a Windows 11
  bug in shell32.dll and the Intel TBB memory manager, which the 64-bit dtSearch Indexer used. The error
  occurred consistently on Windows 11 machines with OneDrive configured to back up the Desktop folder,
  although other cases may exist as well. This issue may affect any Windows application that uses the Intel
  TBB memory manager (tbbmalloc.dll) or similar replacement allocator such as Microsoft's mimalloc.dll.
  Technical details on the issue are [here
  (github.com - Intel TBB project)](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB/issues/665) and [here
  (github.com - Microsoft mimalloc project)](https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc/issues/498)
* Fixed: Indexing error affecting the multithreaded indexing preview feature causing index updates to fail
  with a "203" error code.

## dtSearch 2021.02 (Build 8730) Released December 6, 2021

### All Products

* *Multithreaded Indexing Preview*
  Added support for building indexes using multiple threads, greatly
  improving indexing speed on 64-bit Windows systems with multiple cores. At least 16 Gb of memory is
  required.
   In dtSearch Desktop/Network, click Options > Preferences > Indexing Resources to enable
  this option.
   For information on using multithreaded indexing in the API, please see  [Multithreaded Operations](https://support.dtsearch.com/faq/dts0233.htm) .
   This is a
  preview feature and should not be used for production work until released.
* Added support for the Hancom Office HWPX file format
* Windows 11, Windows Server 2022, and .NET 6 added as supported platform/environments.

### dtSearch Desktop/Network

* *Index Groups*
   Index groups provide a way to organize your indexes in the Search dialog box to make
  very large numbers of indexes easier to manage. To enable this option, click Options > Preferences >
  Search Options, and check the box to "Show indexes by group". When groups are enabled, if an index name
  contains a colon, then the part before the colon is considered to be the group. For example, if an index is
  named "Business: Records", then the group is "Business". In the Search dialog box, "Records" would appear
  under a collapsible "Business" group heading.
* *"Find indexes"*
   The new "find indexes" control in the Search dialog box lets you filter the list
  of indexes by name and quickly select indexes to search using the keyboard.
   To enable it, click Options
  > Preferences > Search Options, and check the box to "Show index finder".
   To use "find indexes",
  in the Search dialog box press Ctrl+F and type any part of an index name. As you type the index list will
  update to only show matching index names. You can also use the \* and ? wildcard characters to find indexes
  using wildcard matches.
   Press Ctrl+Q to quickly check only the first listed index and return to the
  search request box, or press ENTER to just return to the search request box.
* Better handling of font scaling on systems with multiple monitors.
* Added sort direction arrows to the search results column headers.
* Added Ctrl+Q hotkey for checking/unchecking checkboxes to select items in search results.
* Added support for using 64-bit Adobe Acrobat/Adobe Reader to display PDF files. The [64-bit dtSearch PDF Search Highlighter plug-in](https://www.dtsearch.com/pdfhl) is also needed
  for hit-highlighting to work.
* The dtSearch Desktop/Network search shortcut now launches the dtSearch Desktop/Network version that
  corresponds to the Adobe Reader/Acrobat version installed, so if you have the 64-bit version of Adobe
  Acrobat or Adobe Reader, the shortcut will automatically launch the 64-bit version of dtSearch
  Desktop/Network.
* Added option in Options > Preferences > Indexing resources to "Store a copy of indexed Outlook items
  in the index". Checking this option eliminates the need to run the 32-bit version of dtSearch
  Desktop/Network if you are using the 32-bit version of Outlook and the 64-bit version of dtSearch
  Desktop/Network if you are using the 64-bit version of Outlook, because dtSearch can display retrieved
  Outlook items by extracting them from the index.

### dtSearch Engine

* Added M1 support to the macOS version of the dtSearch Engine.
* Added streaming interface to Java DataSource API to allow data source documents to be returned as objects.

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* Fixed bug causing "Search within these results" in dtSearch Desktop/Network to return an incorrect error
  message when searching just-created indexes.
* Fixed bug causing indexing crash due to low-level I/O error.
* File parser bug fixes affecting: XLSX, DOCX, PDF
* Other bug fixes

## dtSearch 2021.01 (Build 8712) Released June 23, 2021

### All Products

* Beginning with this version, the minimum supported Windows version for dtSearch Desktop is Windows 7, and
  the minimum supported Windows version for the dtSearch Engine is Windows Vista.
* dtSearch version numbers will now be based on the year released and an ordinal, so this version is 2021.01.
  This numbering change does not reflect any change in compatibility or index format.
   For developers
  using the API, the internal major version number returned by the API will remain "7". The minor version
  number will use two digits for the year and two digits for the ordinal, so the third version released in
  2021 would have minor version number 2103.

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* Added support for extracting macro text from vbaProject.bin files
* File parser bug fixes affecting: PDF, DOCX
* Updated WebDemo sample .NET Core application for .NET Core 3.1/5.0
* Fixed bug affecting mailto: links extracted using API with the dtsoFfHtmlShowLinks flag
* Other bug fixes

## dtSearch 7.97 (Build 8684) October 14, 2020

### dtSearch Desktop

* Added option in dtSearch Desktop to automatically use the 64-bit indexer if possible for indexing.
   This
  option is in Options > Preferences > Indexing Resources and is enabled by default.
   When this box
  is checked, the 64-bit indexer will be used for any eligible index update, regardless of how it is started
  (scheduled, invoked using "Update Index", or invoked using "Update Multiple Indexes"). Under 64-bit versions
  of Windows, all indexes can be built with the 64-bit indexer except indexes of Outlook messages when the
  Microsoft Office version installed is 32-bit. When multiple indexes are being updated in a scheduled task
  that updates several indexes, the 64-bit indexer will be used for all indexes that are 64-bit eligible, and
  the 32-bit indexer will be launched separately to update any indexes that must be run in 32-bit mode.
* Added an option in dtSearch Desktop to control whether dtSearch should check for sufficient disk space
  before starting an index update. If this box is checked, dtSearch will estimate the amount of disk space
  needed to build an index and will halt the update with an error message if insufficient space is
  available.
  This option is in Options > Preferences > Indexing Resources.

### dtSearch Engine

* The 64-bit Windows version of the engine supports options for using a replacement memory manager such as
  Intel's TBB library, which can improve performance in heavily-multithreaded applications. For more
  information on, please see this article: ["External
  allocator integration"](https://support.dtsearch.com/webhelp/dtSearchCppApi/External_allocator_integration.html)

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* Fixed bug affecting term weighting applied by field name
* File parser bug fixes affecting: XLS, XLSX, ZIP (malicious compressed content detection improved), DOCX
* Fixed date parsing bug affecting search requests containing two or more date ranges spanning different years
  expressed as text
* Fixed HTML hit highlighting error affecting unrecognized tag with no spaces around it* Fixed memory leak in .NET Core DataSource indexing API
  * Other bug fixes

## dtSearch 7.96 (Build 8668) March 30, 2020

* The 64-bit version of the dtSearch Engine now uses the [Microsoft Universal
  CRT](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/introducing-the-universal-crt/). The CRT is included with Windows 10 and is automatically installed by Windows Update on most
  other versions of Windows. It can be installed as described this Microsoft article:  [The
  latest supported Visual C++ downloads.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads)* The 64-bit version of the dtSearch Engine supports Windows version Vista and later, so Windows XP is no
    longer supported.
  * The dtSearch PDF Search Highlighter plug-in has been updated for compatibility with the 2020 versions of
    Adobe Reader and Adobe Acrobat. The new [highlighter can be
    downloaded here.](https://www.dtsearch.com/pdfhl/)
  * Fixed bug in .NET Standard DataSource API affecting modification and creation dates of documents and the
    DocDisplayName property.* Fixed hit highlighting error affecting EML with embedded IMG tag.* Fixed bug affecting the "not w/n" operator, causing it to retrieve a document that should not have been
        retrieved.* File parser bug fixes affecting: XLS, DOC, DOCX, PDF
        * Other bug fixes

## dtSearch 7.95 (Build 8633) October 24, 2019

* Fixed: in the .NET and .NET Core API, IndexInfo.UserFields did not delimit fields and values clearly. A
  quote-delimited string is used now, with double quote characters in field values converted to single quote
  characters to prevent ambiguity.
* Fixed: Crash when the dtsConvertAutoUpdateSearch flag was used with dtsSearchWantHitsByWord in a field
  search.
* Fixed: bug affecting fuzzy search in combination with wildcard near front of word.
* Fixed: multicolor hit highlighting did not work with a search request that included a regular expression
  with the ( character as part of the regular expression pattern.
* Fixed: Encoding error processing long UTF-8 text file (in version 7.94 only)
* File parser bug fixes affecting: PDF, XLS, Unicode Filtering, MSG, CSV
* Other bug fixes

## dtSearch 7.94 (Build 8620) July 19, 2019

* Developer note: dtv\_pdfcrypto.dll (Windows) and dtv\_pdfcrypto.so (Linux) are now separate components again,
  as they were in versions 7.92 and earlier. (In version 7.93, the cryptographic capabilities of
  dtv\_pdfcrypto.dll and dtv\_pdfcrypto.so were merged into the dtSearch Engine, to provide a simplified, flat
  deployment option for developers. We are reversing this decision in version 7.94 because the new
  ViewerLibraries element in the homedir.xml file provides a more flexible way to get the same result while
  covering other external file parsers and also preserving a separate engine version limited to 40-bit RC4
  encryption for developers.)
* Fixed in 7.94.8620: A bug in versions 7.93 and 7.94.8619 caused errors in the target index for the merge
  when a newly-created index was merged with an index created by an earlier version. To determine if an index
  is affected by the bug, run Verify Index using version 7.94. Affected indexes will be reported as having a
  merge consistency error. Compressing the index with version 7.94 will repair the errors, and version 7.94
  will also correct for the index errors when searching the index.
* In indexes created with the "Hyphens all three" option (dtsoHyphenAll), hyphens in search requests are now
  treated as spaces instead of significant by default, so a search for "one-two" will find "one two". To
  restore the previous treatment, there is a new option in dtSearch Desktop in Options > Preferences >
  Letters and Words. In the API, use the flag dtsSearchHyphenSignificant in SearchJob. This option does not
  affect indexing.
* Added new Options.CheckConfiguration API to validate that a dtSearch Engine application has been correctly
  deployed. CheckConfiguration checks for missing components such as the ICU library, CMAP files, alphabet
  file, stemming rules, etc. Use CheckConfigurationFlags to specify the items to check. In the C++ API, use
  dtssCheckConfiguration.
* Added an option to skip symbolic links during indexing. In dtSearch Desktop, this is in Options >
  Preferences > Filtering Options, and in the API use the flag dtsIndexSkipSymbolicLinks.* Added flag dtsoTfMimeFollowContentDispositionForText in Options.TextFlags to tell dtSearch to treat plain
    text or HTML in MIME messages as attachments rather than part of the message body if the message part has a
    Content-Disposition header specifying that the part is an attachment.
  * Fixed: dtSearch Desktop bug causing the list of indexes to be empty after an out-of-memory error
  * Fixed: SearchResults.SerializeAsXml did not preserve 32-bit Unicode characters.
  * Fixed: Hit highlighting error that resulted in an extra </div> tag to be generated in conversion
    output from some Office documents, resulting in formatting errors.
  * Fixed: Hit highlighting bugs affecting PDF, conversion to HTML, and SearchReportJob when using cached text
  * Fixed: Bug in encoding detection could cause a crash indexing or converting files with unknown encoding
    (plain text or HTML)* File parser bug fixes affecting .html, WMF and EMF images, Excel 2003 XML, XBase, Excel 95, PPT.
    * Other bug fixes

## dtSearch 7.93 (Build 8596) March 19, 2019

* Fixed: Intermittent crash when generating search reports (build 8596)
* Fixed bugs in the new ICU-based Unicode processing including word breaking error affecting Katakana
  Half-width characters U+FF60-FF9F, U+2103 degrees Celsius and U+2109 degrees Fahrenheit.
* Fixed: Crash indexing corrupt PowerPoint file due to read past end of buffer
* Fixed: Indexing bug affecting the new accent-optional index type with the "hyphen all three" option set.
* Fixed: 16-byte memory leak each time ICU-based automatic encoding detection is done for a file with
  ambiguous encoding information during indexing or file conversion, potentially causing out-of-memory errors
  indexing very large document collections with the 32-bit indexer
* Fixed: Error compiling dtSearchNetApi4 sample code
* Other bug fixes

## dtSearch 7.93 (Build 8592) February 25, 2019

### All Products

* This version adds *preliminary* support for the new PDF 2.0 file format. PDF 2.0 is the first major
  change in the PDF file format since PDF 1.0 in 1993. Support is "preliminary" because while there are
  some tools that can open PDF 2.0 files now, end-user commercial software products have not yet started
  to support generation of new PDF 2.0 output so there is almost no data available for testing.

  Because this new PDF version changes the header information, **dtSearch versions before 7.93 will not
  recognize the PDF 2.0 file format and will miss all content in these files**. Therefore, it is
  *essential* to use dtSearch 7.93 or later before attempting to index and search PDF 2.0 files.
* Added new "Accent-optional" index type.

  To create an accent-optional index in dtSearch Desktop/Network, click Index > Create Index (Advanced)
  and check the box to "Support optional accent sensitivity".

  When you select an accent-optional index for searching, the Search dialog box will show a new option,
  "Accents in search terms are significant".

  In an accent-optional index, accented letters can be made significant for matching purposes, but
  unaccented letters will still always match both accented and unaccented forms.

  For example, a search for "abc" in an accent-optional index find both "abc" and "Ã¤bc". The results will
  be the same whether or not you check the "Accents in search terms are significant" box.

  A search for "Ã¤bc" in an accent-optional index will find different results depending on whether the
  "Accents in search terms are significant" box is checked. If the box is checked, then "Ã¤bc" will match
  "Ã¤bc" and not "abc". If the box is not checked, then "Ã¤bc" will match both "Ã¤bc" and "abc".
* Added support for searching emoji characters in indexes created with version 7.93 and later.
* Microsoft has deprecated support for Windows XP compatiblity in Visual Studio. Because the Windows version
  of dtSearch is built with Visual Studio, this means that dtSearch support for Windows XP is now deprecated
  as well. (dtSearch is currently built using Visual Studio 2017 which still supports Windows XP.)

### Index Compatibility

* To enable new features in dtSearch 7.93, this version makes some changes in the index format. Older dtSearch
  versions will be able to search indexes created by dtSearch 7.93, but this is not recommended due to lack of
  support in older dtSearch versions for the new features added in version 7.93 such as Accent-optional
  indexes.
* If you use dtSearch to merge new indexes into older existing indexes: indexes created with dtSearch 7.93
  will not be compatible with older indexes for purposes of merging indexes, unless you specify when you
  create the newer index that it must be compatible with the older index that will be included in or the
  target of the merge. To create an index that is compatible with an existing older index, use Create
  Index (Advanced), check the box to make the index compatible with an existing index, and select the
  index to use for compatibility.

  Using the API, set IndexJob.CreateCompatibleIndexPath to specify the index to use as the source for
  compatibility information. To preserve the compatibility of an existing index that is being updated with
  ActionCreate=true, set the flag dtsIndexCreatePreserveExistingSettings in IndexJob. (This is equivalent
  to setting IndexJob.CreateCompatibleIndexPath to IndexJob.IndexPath.)

### dtSearch Engine

* Added integration with the International Components for Unicode (ICU) providing improvements in text
  processing, such as the new accent-optional index type and support for emoji searching, for indexes
  created with version 7.93. Please see "ICU Integration" in the dtSearch Engine API Reference for more
  information. ICU integration is optional for applications using the developer API, and enabled by
  default in other products.

  Optional integration with ICU can be enabled using a new icuconfig.xml configuration file.
* To enable the new accent-optional index type (see above) set the flag dtsIndexCreateOptionalAccentSensitive
  in IndexingFlags. To require accents to match at search time, set the flag dtsSearchRequireAccents in
  SearchFlags. Note: ICU integration must be enabled to use the new accent-optional index type.
* A new IndexJob.CreateCompatibleIndexPath option lets you specify an existing index to use as a template when
  creating an index. The noise word list, alphabet, ICU character tables and other text processing rules such
  as dtsoTfAutoBreakCJK will be copied from the old index into the new index.
* The cryptographic capabilities of dtv\_pdfcrypto.dll (Windows) and dtv\_pdfcrypto.so (Linux) are now built
  into the dtSearch Engine itself. Previously the dtSearch Engine .dlls and .so files for Windows and Linux
  only supported decryption up to 40-bit RC4, and the dtv\_pdfcrypto.\* files were needed to enable decryption
  up to 256-bit AES. Please see "Export Notice" section of the ["Installing
  the dtSearch Engine"](http://support.dtsearch.com/webhelp/dtSearchCppApi/Installing_the_dtSearch_Engine.html) article in the dtSearch Engine API Reference for information on exporting the
  crypto-enabled dtSearch components.
* dtSearch Engine supports a new homedir.xml file that can be used to specify the location of data files
  and the viewers folder and to consolidate data files separately from executables. Previously the CMAP
  files were installed under the bin and bin64 folder and the WordNet files were installed in a top-level
  folder under the dtSearch Developer folder. Now these files can be installed along with other data files
  (alphabet, noise word lists, stemming rules) in a "data" folder parallel to the bin and bin64 folder.

  Use of homedir.xml is optional. Developers can still use the old deployment locations for data files.

### Fixes and other enhancements

* Fixed: dtSearch Desktop/Network, when saving search results as CSV, incorrectly quoted user-defined (stored
  field) field values containing quotation marks.
* Fixed: Extra whitespace appears in front of tables when viewing some retrieved HTML files in Internet
  Explorer and dtSearch Desktop.
* Fixed: In the .NET Core API for Linux, the array SearchResultsItem.Hits reported incorrect word offsets of
  hits. This did not affect hit highlighting if SearchResults.SetInputItem() was used because the correct hit
  offsets stored internally in SearchResults were used.
* Fixed: Intermittent crash indexing PDF file due to read past end of buffer
* Fixed: Incorrect indexing of hyphens in indexes created with dtsoHyphenAllThree ("all three ways") option
  and then updated with a different hyphenation option.
* Fixed: Sorting search results by title resulting in incorrect ordering for PDF files.
* Fixed: Indexing error affecting Outlook and Spider indexes in dtSearch Desktop (7.93 Build 8591 only)
* File parser bug fixes affecting \*.rtf, \*.msg, \*.pdf
* Other bug fixes

## dtSearch 7.92 (Build 8572) November 15, 2018

### All Products

* Added support for Hancom \*.hwp files. Support covers both the current \*.hwp format and the Hanword 97
  format.

### Fixes and other enhancements

* Updated RAR file parser to the current version of the Rarlab source. [Rarlab reports that the updated source fixes bugs that "may be
  associated with security vulnerabilities."](https://rarlab.com/rarnew.htm)
* The dtSearch PDF Search Highlighter plug-in has been updated for compatibility with the 2019 versions of
  Adobe Reader and Adobe Acrobat. The new [highlighter can be
  downloaded here.](https://www.dtsearch.com/pdfhl/)
* dtSearch Desktop/Network updated for compatibility with highlighting hits using and the new version of the
  PDF highlighter (see above).
* Fixed: In dtSearch Desktop, search for date after a specified date in More Search Options results in
  "Invalid date M99/D99/Y9999" error.
* Fixed: Malformed HTML generated when highlighting hits in HTML files with dtsoFfHtmlShowLinks flag set.
* Fixed: Build configuration error that could cause a crash on startup in dtv\_pdfcrypto.dll under Windows XP
  when calling application directly loaded dtv\_pdfcrypto.dll with LoadLibrary.
* Fixed: File parser bug in Linux version 7.92 build 8571 affecting Outlook MSG files.
* File parser bug fixes affecting: \*.html, \*.pptx (hit highlighting error).
* Other bug fixes.

## dtSearch 7.91 (Build 8553) June 17, 2018

### dtSearch Engine

* Added faceted search and multicolor hit highlighting to the ASP.NET Core sample application.
* Added flag dtsoTfUseEmailDateAsFileDate in Options.TextFlags to use the internal message date (sent/received
  date) as the file date for standalone .msg and .eml files, for purposes of file date filtering and the date
  that appears in search results.
* .NET Standard API: fields in Options and SearchResultsItem changed to properties; additional optional
  parameters in SearchResults.UrlEncodeItemWithIndexId (applications will need to be recompiled but no source
  code changes needed).

### Fixes and other enhancements

* This version fixes a denial of service vulnerability affecting searches in dtSearch Web, and potentially
  other web-facing applications using the dtSearch Engine that accept very long search requests.
* Fixed: In dtSearch Desktop, Outlook error "8004010f = MAPI\_E\_NOT\_FOUND "The information store could not be
  opened." trying to view Outlook messages after a search."
* File parser bug fixes affecting: .html
* Other bug fixes.

## dtSearch 7.90 (Build 8538) April 12, 2018

### dtSearch Engine

* The dtSearch Engine has a new [.NET
  Standard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard) API similar to the current .NET API in dtSearchNetApi4.dll, but compatible with .NET
  Standard 2.0, .NET Core, and Xamarin. Supported platforms: Windows, UWP, Linux, macOS, Android (beta), and
  iOS (beta).
   As with the current .NET API, the .NET Standard API relies on a dtSearch Engine native
  library (dtSearchEngine.dll under Windows, libdtSearchEngine.so under Linux, etc.). Therefore, applications
  will need both the .NET Standard API wrapper, dtSearchNetStdApi.dll, and the native library for each
  platform.
   For more information on this new API, please see: [.NET Standard API Information](https://support.dtsearch.com/faq/dts0241.htm) and the  [API documentation](http://support.dtsearch.com/webhelp/dtSearchNetStdApi).
   The current
  dtSearch Engine for Windows version includes the Windows and UWP versions of the .NET Standard API. The
  current dtSearch Engine for Linux version includes the Linux version of the NET Standard API. For other
  platforms, please [contact dtSearch](https://www.dtsearch.com/contact.html)
* Added new ASP.NET Core web search sample application, installed in the examples\NetStd\WebDemo folder.
* Added new flag in Options.FieldFlags, dtsoFfNormalizeEmailAddresses, to remove extra space and quotation
  marks from email address fields and move embedded comments to the end of the name or email address.
* Added new flag in Options.TextFlags, dtsoTfHtmlSkipNav, to skip indexing content inside
  <nav>...</nav> tags.
* Added new flag in Options.TextFlags, dtsoTfIgnoreNoIndex, to ignore <!--BeginNoIndex--> and
  <!--EndNoIndex--> tags in HTML.

### dtSearch Desktop

* To make it easier to review the results of large numbers of scheduled index updates, scheduled tasks now
  generate a summary report listing all of the indexes updated and the results for each. After a scheduled
  update, click the "Last Update" button in the "Schedule Updates" dialog box to see the summary report. The
  report will also contain links to the detailed index update reports for each index.
   These reports will
  be stored in the LOGS subfolder of your dtSearch data folder so you can also access them directly in this
  folder.

### Fixes and other enhancements

* Fixed: dtSearch Desktop Indexer reports index is is in use when started from dtSearch Desktop Search
* Fixed: C++ API crash in executing dtsSearchReportJob if pReportCallBack is zero
* File parser bug fixes affecting: .pdf, .wpd
* Fixed dialog box error in "Schedule Updates" in dtSearch Desktop indexer (build 8538)
* Other bug fixes.

## dtSearch 7.89 (Build 8517) November 20, 2017

### dtSearch Engine

* New flag dtsIndexTokenizeEnumerableFields in IndexJob.IndexingFlags to automatically tokenize multi-value
  enumerable fields using Options.StoredFieldDelimiterChar. For example, if a field value is
  "First!Second!Third" and StoredFieldDelimiterChar is !, then instead of one enumerable field containing
  "First!Second!Third", the document will be indexed with three separate enumerable field values, "First",
  "Second", and "Third".

### Fixes and other enhancements

* Fixed: dtSearch Desktop opens very slowly after the Windows 10 "Fall Creators Update" is installed,
  particularly after Windows has been running for a while without rebooting. The source of the problem appears
  to be how the Windows 10 "Fall Creators Update" implements the Win32 GetPixel API. The new version bypasses
  GetPixel to the extent possible, relying on other methods of obtaining pixel data.
* Fixed XML syntax errors converting database files (\*.dbf, \*.csv) to it\_ContentAsXml
* Fixed: Intermittent crash when closing dtSearch after doing a search that retrieves Outlook messages.
* File parser bug fixes affecting: .pdf, .msg
* Other bug fixes.

## dtSearch 7.88 (Build 8499) September 25, 2017

### dtSearch Engine

* New flag dtsoTfHideRevisions in Options.TextFlags to remove strikeout text and redlining from Microsoft Word
  documents edited using "Track Changes".
* it\_ContentAsXml output format now marks headers and footers in Office documents

### Fixes and other enhancements

* .NET API: Fixed bug in Server.SetEnginePath that could cause an ApiInitializer exception if the path passed
  to SetEnginePath contained Unicode characters.
* The rarely-used HTML header fields (HtmlTitle, HtmlH1, etc.) are now disabled by default. Set the flag
  dtsoFfHtmlIndexHeadersAsFields in Options.FieldFlags to enable them.
* File parser bug fixes affecting: .xlsb, .pdf
* Fixed spider bug due to invalid temp filename generated from page URL
* Other bug fixes.

## dtSearch 7.87 (Build 8481) July 1, 2017

### dtSearch Desktop/Network

* New indexing option: "Generate and index SHA-256 hashes for documents" in Options > Preferences >
  Indexing Options. Hashes are unique numerical codes that are sometimes used in forensics to identify files.
  dtSearch now has an option to generate an SHA-256 hash for each document as it is indexed and to append the
  hash to the indexed document text as a field named "Sha256Hash". The original document is not changed in any
  way; this just affects the index and provides another way to search. Generating hashes will make indexing
  slower.

### dtSearch Engine

* dtSearch Engine for macOS released, with APIs for C++ and Java. The API and indexes are compatible with the
  Windows, UWP, and Linux versions of the dtSearch Engine.
* New search option to use File Conditions to search by detected type id. Example: xfilter(type "excel") will
  limit a search to files created by Excel, regardless of filename or extension.
   Currently, developers
  have the option to add the optional File Type and File Type Id fields to documents during indexing by
  setting the dtsoFfIncludeFileTypeField and dtsoFfIncludeFileTypeIdField flags in Options.FieldFlags. When
  documents are indexed with these flags, field searches can be done on the file type like this: "File Type
  contains Excel", and after a search retrieved documents will appear with a "File Type" field at the end.

  The new "type" filter search works with any index created by dtSearch 7.87 or later and does not depend on
  any option settings. It does add any visible text to documents after a search, and can be efficiently
  combined with other file selection criteria (size, date, name, extension) using the File Conditions syntax.
* New flag in Options.FieldFlags: dtsoFfGenerateSha256Hash (see explanation under dtSearch Desktop above).
* Added C# sample code demonstrating how to index SharePoint data using the DataSource API.

### Fixes and other enhancements

* dtSearch Desktop: the option to display long files in report view will not apply to PDF files.
* dtSearch Desktop: after an index update, in addition to the HTML file listing documents that could not be
  indexed (Index\_LastUpdateErrors.htm), dtSearch Desktop will now also create plain-text files with simple
  lists of filenames to faciliate automated processing. The filename lists will be: IndexLog\_ImageOnlyPdf.txt,
  IndexLog\_Encrypted.txt, and IndexLog\_OtherErrors.txt.
* Added button in dtSearch Diagnostic Tools to delete all dtSearch-related temporary files.
* Mapitool name templates can use # instead of % to identify symbols (example: "##Subject## [##Ordinal##]")
  for easier use in DOS batch scripts. The old % syntax still works.
* Mapitool defaults to using a simple message ordinal (1, 2, 3, ...) instead of the message record key to
  generate a unique filename for each message, because record keys can be very long in newer versions of
  Outlook. The -t command-line switch can be used to override the default.
* File parser bug fixes affecting: .xls, .pdf, one, mp4, .pptx, .mdb
* Other bug fixes.

## dtSearch 7.86 (Build 8458) February 28, 2017

### dtSearch Desktop/Network

* New indexing option: "Index links in PDF files" in Options > Preferences > Indexing Options. If
  checked, dtSearch will index any links embedded in PDF files.
* New indexing option: "Generate and index MD5 hashes for documents" in Options > Preferences > Indexing
  Options. MD5 hashes are unique numerical codes that are sometimes used in forensics to identify files.
  dtSearch now has an option to generate an MD5 hash for each document as it is indexed and to append the hash
  to the indexed document text as a field named "MD5Hash". The original document is not changed in any way;
  this just affects the index and provides another way to search. Generating MD5 hashes will make indexing
  slower.
* Added option in Options > Preferences > Fonts and Colors to suppress use of color when highlighting
  hits.

### dtSearch Engine

* New flags in Options.FieldFlags: dtsoFfPdfShowLinks and dtsoFfGenerateMd5Hash (see explanation under
  dtSearch Desktop above).

### Fixes and other enhancements

* Fixed incorrect detection of associated PDF application in Windows running inside Parallels Desktop for Mac.
* File parser bug fixes affecting: .xlsx, .pdf, \*.wpd, \*.one, \*.pptx, \*.xlsx
* Other bug fixes.

## dtSearch 7.85 (Build 8438) December 7, 2016

### dtSearch Desktop/Network

* dtSearch Desktop/Network now offers the option to highlight each search term or phrase in a search request
  in a different color. To enable this option, and to change the colors used for highlighting, click Options
  > Preferences > Fonts and Color.
* Added option in Options > Preferences > Indexing Options to index databases as text. With this option
  selected, database files such as Microsoft Access (\*.mdb, \*.accdb) and CSV files are indexed without
  treating each row as a separate document, and without including field attributes. All of the text, including
  field names, remains searchable, but database content is combined into a single plain text document, which
  makes indexing and searching faster.
* Added option in Options > Preferences > Indexing Options to index XML files as text. With this option
  selected, XML files are indexed without including field attributes. All of the text, including field names,
  remains searchable, but XML content treated as plain text, which makes indexing and searching faster.
* Added checkbox in dtSearch Desktop to enable compatibility with Parallels Desktop for Mac. Parallels Desktop
  is a program that enables Windows to run on Mac computers.
   The option enables dtSearch to work around
  an issue in Parallels Desktop that causes Parallels to report the modification date of files located in Mac
  folders as January 1, 1601. When this box is checked, dtSearch alters the indexing process to ensure that
  the correct dates are detected.
   The option is in Options > Preferences > Indexing Options.

### dtSearch Web/Publish

* dtSearch Web and dtSearch Publish now offer the option to highlight each search term or phrase in a search
  request in a different color. The colors used for highlighting are stored in the dtsearch\_options.html file
  in the HighlightColors section. To enable this option when generating a search form, click the Document
  Display Options tab in Form Builder and check the box to "Highlight hits using multiple colors."
   To
  modify an existing search form to use multiple colors, add these lines to the end of your
  dtsearch\_options.html file:
  ```

  <BR><HR><I>HighlightColors: </I>
  <!-- $Begin HighlightColors -->
  ffff00,a6f500,00ffe3,cbe3ff,c5c3fa,ffbcff,ff9999,fcbf29,d7d7d7,eaddc2
  <!-- $End -->

  <BR><HR><I>Highlight hits using multiple colors: </I>
  <!-- $Begin MultiColorHighlighting -->
  1
  <!-- $End -->

  ```

### dtSearch Engine

* New UWP versions of the dtSearch Engine are included with this version. The UWP version of the C# API is
  implemented in dtSearchUwpApi.dll, and the C++ API is implemented in dtSearchEngine\_uwp\_Win32.dll and
  dtSearchEngine\_uwp\_x64.dll.
   For sample code, please the sample application in C:\Program Files\dtSearch
  Developer\examples\cs4\UwpDemo.
   The UWP API is identical to the .NET API with a few exceptions, which
  are described in a the file "dtSearch Engine for UWP.docx" in the UwpDemo folder.
* Added flags dtsoTfXmlAsText and dtsoTfDatabasesAsText to Options.TextFlags, corresponding to the two new
  options in dtSearch Desktop described above to index XML files as plain text and to index databases as plain
  text.
* Two enhancements to the implementation of multicolor hit highlighting in the developer API:
   (1) First, a
  new flag dtsSearchWantHitsByWordOrdinals has been added to the SearchFlags enumeration, and this flag should
  be used along with dtsSearchWantHitsByWord and dtsSearchWantHitsArray. With this flag set, each word or
  phrase in the HitsByWord report for a document will be preceded by an ordinal that constently identifies
  that word or phrase from among the words or phrases in the search request. This makes it possible for
  dtSearch to ensure that the mapping between search terms and highlighting attributes is consistent for all
  documents retrieved in a search, regardless of which terms were retrieved in each individual document.

  (2) Second, use of multiple highlighting attributes, enabled by the flag dtsConvertMultiHighlight, can now
  be combined with the dtsConvertUpdateSearch flag, which updates hit offsets for a retrieved document to
  reflect any changes either in the dtSearch version or the document since the document was indexed.

### Fixes and other enhancements

* Added dtsExoUseSimpleFilenames flag to ExtractionOptions to limit extracted attachment filenames to 64
  characters, Ascii-only.
* Added support for EMF Spool (\*.SPL) files
* Added support for \*.PPT and \*.XLS files encrypted with 40-bit RC4 encryption to prevent modification, as
  long as a password is not needed to open the file.
* Improved handling of malformed dates in EML and MBOX messages.
* File parser bug fixes affecting: .docx, .pdf, .xls, \*.ppt, \*.EMF, OpenOffice
* Fixed automatic date recognition bug affecting date ranges.
* Other bug fixes.

## dtSearch 7.84 (Build 8405) August 31, 2016

### dtSearch Engine

* Compatibility note: dtSearchNetApi4.dll is now built with Visual Studio 2015 Update 3, so the CRT and MFC
  redistributables installers (VC\_redist\*.exe) for Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 should be used when deploying
  dtSearchNetApi4.dll. These installers are available here:
  https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53840.

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* dtSearch Desktop indexer now reports image-only PDF files in the index update log. (Metadata in these files
  is still indexed. This change only affects reporting in the index update log.)
* Improved 32-bit indexing performance in low-memory conditions.
* Fixed indexing crash in mso20win32client.dll in the latest update to Office 2016 when indexing Outlook
  messages.
* Added API to change the score of a document in the dtsnSearchFound notification (C++) or
  ISearchStatusHandler.OnFound callback (.NET). In the C++ API, return dtsChangedItemScore from the
  dtsnSearchFound notification and set dtsSearchResultsItem.score to the new value. In the .NET 4.0 API, in
  ISearchStatusHandler.OnFound, set SearchResultsItem.Score to the new value and set
  SearchResultsItem.ChangedItemScore to true.
* File parser bug fixes affecting: .pdf, .rtf, .emf, .doc, .xls, .ppt, .pst
* Fixed bug in build 7.84.8404 causing the ' (apostrophe) character to appear incorrectly in conversion output
  in Internet Explorer 8.
* Other bug fixes.

## dtSearch 7.83 (Build 8353) April 14, 2016

### dtSearch Engine

* Compatibility note: dtSearchNetApi4.dll is now built with Visual Studio 2015 Update 1, so the CRT and MFC
  redistributables installers (VC\_redist\*.exe) for Visual Studio 2015 should be used when deploying
  dtSearchNetApi4.dll. These installers are available here:
  https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145.

### Fixes and minor enhancements

## dtSearch 7.82 (Build 8339) Released January 25, 2016

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* All executables are code signed using SHA-2 in addition to SHA-1 (dual signed). All MSI files are signed
  using SHA-2 only, because MSI files do not support dual signing. Please see this Microsoft article
  (http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/32288.windows-enforcement-of-authenticode-code-signing-and-timestamping.aspx)
  Microsoft article for more information on SHA-1 deprecation.
* Added option in dtSearch Desktop's Edit > Copy File function to automatically shorten excessively long
  filenames.
* Added new C# sample, AjaxWordListBuilder, demonstrating how to use the dtSearch Engine's WordListBuilder
  object on a web page.
* Added ixStepCommittingUpdate and ixStepRemovingDeletedFiles to the IndexingStep enumeration to separately
  identify these steps during an index update.
* Added file parser support for a OneNote file format variant created by certain Microsoft online services.
* Added experimental option in dtSearch Desktop to use the standard dtSearch Desktop "Next Hit" toolbar button
  to navigate hits in PDF files displayed in Adobe Reader (otherwise only the Ctrl+Shift+Space hotkey can be
  used). This option is in Options > Preferences > PDF View Options.
* File parser bug fixes affecting: .pdf, .xlsx, .xlsb
* Other bug fixes.

## dtSearch 7.81 (Build 8281) October 23, 2015

* Added support for highlighting hits in Adobe Reader DC. An updated version of the dtSearch PDF Search
  Highlighter plug-in is also needed for Adobe Reader DC.
* Other bug fixes.

## dtSearch 7.80 (Build 8253) May 27, 2015

### All products

* Added support for indexing PDF files with 128-bit RC4, 128-bit AES, and 256-bit AES encryption, as long as
  the file does not require a password to open and does not have the "copy text" permission disabled.
  Developer note: This is implemented in a new component, dtv\_pdfCrypto.dll, that is subject to export
  restrictions. Please see the license.htm file accompanying this version for more information. For details on
  the effect of encryption and permission settings on indexing, searching, and text extraction, please see <http://support.dtsearch.com/faq/dts0161.htm>.

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* Fixed dtSearch Desktop bug causing some PDF files to be opened in a separate Adobe Reader window when file
  is located on a network share.
* Fixed extra "PBrush" and "Adobe Photoshop Image" captions in some Word documents with embedded images.
* In the Linux version, the dtSearch Engine library (.so) files are installed in the dtsearch/bin and
  dtsearch/bin64 folders instead of the lib and lib64 folders.
* Added RAR file parser (dtv\_rar.so) to the Linux version of the dtSearch Engine
* Fixed incorrect parsing of some .docx, .xlsx, and .pptx documents when document has missing or incorrect
  filename extension.
* Other file parser bug fixes affecting: .mdb, .pdf, WordPerfect 4.2, WordStar, KeyNote, .tar
* Other bug fixes.

## dtSearch 7.77 (Build 8205) August 23, 2014

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* Fixed security issue reported in a third-party component, imgman32.dll, used in the dtimage.exe utility. See
  <http://support.dtsearch.com/faq/dts0235.htm> for
  more information.
* Added support for indexing Outlook 2013 and 2010 OST files. Note: Microsoft has not officially documented
  the OST file format specification, so this support is based on unofficial non-Microsoft information about
  the OST file format.
* Added support for indexing metadata in Adobe Photoshop images
* Fixed "~dtpdf.tmp" filenames appeared in tabs in dtSearch Publish
* Fixed PDF hit highlighting error in dtSearch Publish on systems with Adobe Reader versions 7-9 and Internet
  Explorer 10
* Added "Images" field at the end of MIME messages listing names of inline image files.
* Fixed incorrect handling of filename-only indexing option causing "Unsupported file format" errors

  and new HTML5 elements such as the calendar control for date searching. [Some examples of the new search forms are posted
  here](http://support.dtsearch.com/support/forms).

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* dtSearch Desktop: fixed keyboard navigation problem affecting PgUp, PgDn, and the cursor keys.
* dtSearch Web: fixed bug causing "Document information could not be retrieved from the index" error message
  when trying to open some documents after a search.
* API enhancement: Options.UserThesaurusFile can be set to an XML string containing the user thesaurus,
  instead of the name of a file containing the thesaurus data.
* dtSearch Web/Publish: Fixed bug affecting multiple selection (using Ctrl+Click) of indexes to search on
  search forms
* dtSearch Web Setup 64-bit: Fixed error launching help
* File parser bug fixes affecting .msg, .doc, .docx, .xlsx, .emf, .pdf
* Other bug fixes.

* Fixed dtSearch Desktop bug affecting keyboard navigation in retrieved documents.
* Fixed dtSearch Web/Publish bugs affecting hit navigation in some browser versions.
* Fixed dtSearch Web/Publish PDF highlighting browser compatibility issue affecting Internet Explorer 11.

## dtSearch 7.73 Build 8139 Released October 7, 2013

* Fixed browser compatibility bug in dtSearch Desktop 7.73.8138 only causing problems with the "Next Hit"
  button on some systems.

## dtSearch 7.73 Build 8138 Released September 30, 2013

### All products

* Support for some older Windows versions is discontinued in dtSearch 7.73. Supported: Windows Server 2012,
  Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2003 SP 2, Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows XP SP 3. Not
  supported: Windows 2000, Windows ME, Windows 98, Windows 95, and Windows XP versions without SP 3.
  This
  change is a result of our transition to Visual Studio 2012, using the v110\_xp platform toolset, to build all
  Windows products. The older .NET API wrappers (dtSearchNetApi2.dll and dtSearchNetApi3.dll) are still built
  using older compilers for compatibility.

### dtSearch Web/Publish

* Note: Updated search form templates for dtSearch Web and dtSearch Publish, previously included in dtSearch
  7.73 beta builds, have been deferred to version 7.74 to allow time for additional browser compatibility
  testing.

### dtSearch Engine

* Added [dtsConvertUseStyles](http://support.dtsearch.com/webhelp/dtSearchCppApi/frames.html?frmname=topic&frmfile=Conversion_output_formatting.html)
  flag in the ConvertFlags enumeration, to provide a way to use CSS styles to format content.
* Added FileConverter.DocTypeTag, to provide a way to specify a DocType in HTML output.
* dtSearchNetApi4.dll is now built using Visual Studio 2012 Update 3.

### dtSearch Desktop

* Added DocStyles.css in the dtSearch templates folder to control the formatting of property tables and
  headings in retrieved files.

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* FileConverter API - fixed missing line breaks when converting from HTML to .txt
* FileConverter API - fixed missing <Fields>...</Fields> tags around HTML metadata when converting
  from HTML to it\_ContentAsXml

  during indexing
* Java API - added Options.storedFieldDelimiterChar
* Reduced memory use when indexing .msg files with very large numbers of recipients or attachments
* SearchReportJob API - fixed slow detection of timeout
* dtSearch Desktop Indexer - fixed "not responding" message when indexing some very large documents
* File parser bug fixes affecting .ppt, .pdf, .xls, .xlsx, .one, .xps, .msg, DocFile property sets
* Other bug fixes.

## dtSearch 7.72 Build 8106 Released May 5, 2013

### All products

* Support for indexing OneNote 2010 and OneNote 2007 \*.one files. Display and extraction of images and
  embedded documents are supported for both formats. Ink is displayed as OCR output (text) only.

### dtSearch Engine

* Added FileConverter.InputStream in the .NET API to allow the input document to be passed as a .NET Stream
  object

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* Added dtsoFfSkipEmailProperties flag in Options.FieldFlags to suppress display of email properties such as
  sender, subject, etc.
* Fixed XML structure errors in XML generated for it\_ContentAsXml output by FileConverter
* File parser bug fixes affecting .msg, .docx, .xfa, .pdf, .rtf, .xlsb, .xlsx, .ppt
* Added detection of Windows PE and NE executables and Linux ELF executables (these formats are still indexed
  according to the binary files setting, with content either filtered or skipped)
* Fixed bug causing use of dtsExoDoNotConvertAttachments in FileConverter.ExtractionOptions to generate an
  incorrect "File Encrypted" error for some documents during file conversion (not indexing or searching).
* Fixed bug causing email headers to be indexed even if dtsoSkipEmailHeaders flag is set if filetype.xml set
  up to index message bodies separately from attachments.
* Added support for metadata extraction from HDPhoto images.
* Fixed bug causing extra whitespace to be generated in conversion to plain text (UTF-8) format.
* Mapitool.exe utility uses message delivered date property instead of modified date property to set the file
  date for extracted message items.
* dtSearch Developer installer updated May 18, 2013 to add missing MemAllocator.h header file.
* Fixed bug affecting nested proximity searches where a matching set of the terms exists exactly once and are
  preceeded (by the exact proximity range) by two or more instances of the proximity terms that do not satisfy
  the proximity criteria.
* Other bug fixes.

## dtSearch 7.71 Build 8080 Released November 30, 2012

### dtSearch Engine

* New support for highlighting hits using different colors for each search term when highlighting hits using
  FileConverter. For API documentation on this feature, please see the article "Highlighting each term using
  different attributes" in dtSearchApiRef.chm. Multicolor hit highlighting is not supported for PDF files
  displayed in Adobe Reader.

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* Added "Find Indexes" button in dtSearch Desktop's Index Library Manager to locate all indexes in a folder
  tree.
* Fixed CSV file parser bug that caused "duplicate field id" error during index merge.
* In dtSearch Web Setup, improved detection and reporting of IIS configuration problems such as missing IIS
  components
* File parser bug fixes affecting MSG, WordPerfect 4.2, PPTX, XBase, PPT, XLSB
* In Language Analyzer API, dtsLaJob.indexRetrievedFrom and dtsLaJob.alphabetLocation were not set during
  searches
* PDF hit highlighting support added for Adobe Reader XI
* Other bug fixes.

## dtSearch 7.70 Build 8063 Released September 28, 2012

### dtSearch Desktop

* New support for displaying images embedded in Office documents (DOC, DOCX, PPT, PPTX, XLS, XLSX, RTF, EML).
  To enable display of images in dtSearch Desktop, click Options > Preferences > Document display, and
  check the box to "Display images in documents".
* Added new options in dtSearch Desktop to (1) hide MIME headers in emails, (2) show properties of images
  embedded in documents, and (3) control whether paths are indexed along with filenames when the "Index
  filenames as text" options is enabled. These options are in the Options > Preferences > Indexing
  Options dialog box.

### dtSearch Engine

* Embedded attachments, objects and images in documents can be extracted using dtsExtractionOptions (C++) or
  ExtractionOptions (Java and .NET), which specify output locations and rules for filename generation.
  Currently the following are supported:
   Attachments in EML, MSG, DBX, TNEF (winmail.dat), PDF, MDB and
  ACCDB (Access);
   objects in DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, PPT, PPTX, RTF;
   images in DOC, DOCX, PPT, PPTX,
  XLS, XLSX, RTF, EML, MDB and ACCDB (Access).
* New single-document option for indexing Access (\*.mdb, \*.accdb), XBase (\*.dbf), and Comma-separated values
  (\*.csv) files.
   By default, dtSearch indexes each record of database files (\*.mdb, \*.accdb, \*.csv, \*.dbf)
  as a separate document. This new option provides a way to index all records in a database file as a single
  document. For more information, see dtSearchApiRef.chm (Overviews > Databases and Fields > Database
  files (\*.mdb, \*.dbf, \*.csv))
* Added dtsoFfShowImageProperties flag in Options.FieldFlags to display image properties (such as EXIF data)
  for images embedded in documents. Image properties are always indexed for images in seperate files. This
  flag only affects images embedded in documents, such as a .jpg embedded in a Word file. A related change,
  made for consistency, affects the hanlding of image files embedded in .eml email files. Previously these
  properties were always extracted. Now they will only be extracted with the dtsoFfShowImageProperties flag is
  set, so .eml files will be handled consistently with other file formats.

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* Eliminated use of FILE\_FLAG\_RANDOM\_ACCESS, which could cause excessive memory consumption under Windows
  Server 2008 because of what appears to be a bug in Windows caching behavior
  http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2549369 for more information).
* Zlib version updated to 1.2.7
* dtSearch.Spider2.dll and dtSearch.Spider4.dll have new dependencies on zlib DLLs
  zlib\_wapidll\_{VC8/VC10}\_{32/64}.dll to handle gzipped sitemap.xml files.
* Added file parsers for Ichitaro word processor versions 5 and later.
* File parser bug fixes affecting MSG, PDF, DOCX, PPTX, Excel 2, RTF
* Message attachments to MIME emails are now indexed as attachments (so they can be handled consistently with
  other attachments in the new attachment-related features described above) rather than being merged with the
  text of the message.
* Added reporting of PDF files that do not contain any page text. In dtSearch Desktop, these will appear in
  the index log with "Image Only" after the type name (click **View Log** in the Update Index dialog box to
  see the log of indexed files). In the API, the flag fiImageOnly will be set in IndexFileInfo (.NET, Java) or
  dtsIndexProgressInfo.fileInfoFlags (C++) during indexing.
* Removed extra path information from headers in containers converted to text using FileConverter.exe or
  FileConvertJob with the dtsConvertInlineContainer flag
* Removed "Document Properties" caption from Word, PowerPoint, and Excel 2003 file properties. For
  applications that require this flag for backward compatibility, use the new flag
  dtsoFfIncludeDocumentPropertiesCaption in Options.FieldFlags
* Added new values to SearchReportJob.Header and SearchReportTemplate.rtf: %%Ordinal%%, %%DocId%%, %%Type%%
* Added new dtsConvertIncludeBOM flag to FileConverter.Flags to add UTF-8 BOM to UTF-8 output
* FileConverter with dtsConvertJustDetectType produces more specific type ids for image, music, and video
  files instead of it\_Media
* Fixed search/highlighting error affecting the pre/N and w/N operators
* Added new dtsnIndexFolderInaccessible callback notification in IndexJob, logging in indexlog.dat, and
  logging in HTML index log of inaccessible folders during indexing
* Fixed incorrect time zone adjustment of PDF built-in creation and modification date fields
* Fixed too-long filenames generated for items extracted from PST files (names could be too long for some file
  systems when copied using Edit > Copy File in dtSearch Desktop)
* Other bug fixes.

## dtSearch 7.68 (Build 8025) December 5, 2011

### All products

* Outlook and MIME email files have a new, simplified header that will be consistent between the two formats
  with these fields: From, SentVia (for emails sent using a mailbox other than the "From" address), To, CC,
  BCC, Subject, Date.
   The footer for these formats will include these additional fields for
  backward-compatibility: Sender (combines From and SentVia); Recipient (combines To, CC, and BCC); SentDate
  (msg files only); DeliveredDate (msg files only).
   The Sender and Recipients fields provide a way to
  search across all senders or all recipients of a message. These fields will also allow searches using the
  field names used in older versions, such as "Sender contains example", to continue to work.
   Documents
  indexed with dtSearch versions 7.67 and earlier will be displayed with the old header so the change will not
  cause hit highlighting problems with previously-indexed emails.

### dtSearch Engine

* Includes new (August 9, 2011) security updates from Microsoft Bulletin MS11-025. For more information on
  this Microsoft security update, including updated dependencies for dtSearch Engine developer components, [please see this article](http://support.dtsearch.com/dts0227.htm).
* Added dtsoFfIndexArchiveFileLists flag. This option adds a searchable file named ArchiveFileList.html to ZIP
  and RAR archives during indexing. The original file is not modified but the ArchiveFileList.html file is
  searchable as if it were part of the ZIP or RAR file. The file consists of a list of the names of the files
  inside the archive.

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* File parser bug fixes affecting XLSX (string values computed by formulas), PST (crash indexing damaged PST
  archive), MSG, DOC (list style formatting, table of contents formatting), XyWrite
* Updated Options > Preferences dialog box in dtSearch Desktop and fixed accessibility issues affecting
  dtSearch Desktop Search and Indexer.
* Other bug fixes.

## dtSearch 7.67 (Build 7973) June 1, 2011

### All products

* Includes security updates from Microsoft Bulletin MS11-025. For more information on this Microsoft security
  update, including updated dependencies for dtSearch Engine developer components, [please see this article](http://support.dtsearch.com/dts0227.htm).
* Added support for indexing PST files directly. Because Outlook locks the PST file that is currently in use,
  this will not work with the PST file that you are actively using in Outlook, and is primarily for use in
  situations where archived or forensically-obtained PST files are being searched.
* Added plug-in for Adobe Reader X to enable hit highlighting in PDF files retrieved after a search. For more
  information please see:

  [dtSearch PDF Highlighter Plug-in
  Documentation](http://www.dtsearch.com/pdfhl/PdfHighlighter.pdf) (PDF)

### dtSearch Desktop

* Added support for highlighting hits in PDF files in Adobe Reader X and Adobe Acrobat X.
* As a result of the [Microsoft MFC
  MS11-025 update](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2011/ms11-025), dtSearch Desktop 7.67 requires Windows XP or or newer and will not run under
  Windows 2000.

### dtSearch Engine

* .NET API: Added DataSource.DocStream to allow a document to be passed through the DataSource API as a stream
* .NET API: Added sample code demonstrating indexing of Azure blob data (examples\cs4\AzureBlobDemo)

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* Fixed hit navigation error in the 64-bit version of dtSearch Desktop
* Fixed file parser bug causing extra spaces to appear in XPS documents
* Fixed bug causing incorrect hit highlighting in documents indexed using the binary filtering algorithm
* Added detection of MIDI files
* File parser bug fixes affecting PPTX, XyWrite, tag font size in XML output, AVI file detection, WordPerfect
  (text using WP character set 12), WordPerfect 5 (soft hyphens), WordPerfect 4.2 (error in automatic file
  type detection), ZIP (filename filters were not applied to exclude ZIP contents in an unindexed search),
  Word for DOS (incorrect parsing of a character code)
* Other bug fixes.

## dtSearch 7.66 (Build 7936) January 25, 2011

### dtSearch Engine

* Added .NET 4.0 versions of the .NET API (dtSearchNetApi4.dll, dtSearch.Spider4.dll) and sample code for C#
  .NET 4.0 and VB.NET 4.0
* Added dtsSearchFastSearchFilterOnly search flag to enable much faster, optimized generation of a
  SearchFilter from a search when no other output is required from the search.
* Added WordListBuilder.GetLastError to the C++, Java, and .NET APIs to provide better reporting of errors
  resulting from WordListBuilder calls.
* Added new flag to enable caching of field values in WordListBuilder to make ListFieldValues calls faster.
  The flag is dtsWordListEnableFieldValuesCache (in the WordListBuilderFlags enumeration) and is passed to
  WordListBuilder using the new SetFlags method.
* Added new .NET method Server.SetEnginePath to allow ASP.NET application deployment without administrative
  access
* Added new .NET sample application, AzureDemo, demonstrating use of the dtSearch Engine in an Azure instance.
  For documentation explaining how to deploy in Azure, see:
   Overviews > Installing the dtSearch Engine
  > Deployment steps: Azure 64-bit (in dtSearchApiRef.chm).
* Added a way to disable file parsers using the file type table (filetype.xml) by setting the TypeId to the id
  of the parser to disable and the Flags value to 2.
* Added a mechanism for a dtsInputStream to simulate an I/O error by returning a negative value from read() of
  less than 10,000. When this occurs, dtSearch will interpret it as an I/O error and halt processing of the
  current input file immediately, reporting an I/O error through the API.

### All Products

* Faster indexing of binary data using the [filtering
  algorithm](http://support.dtsearch.com/webhelp/dtSearchCppApi/frames.html?frmname=topic&frmfile=Filtering_Options.html)

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* In dtSearch Desktop, added SizeK, IndexRetrievedFrom, SearchDate, ReportDate variables to

* Fixed FileConverter bug that caused invalid XML to be generated from some conversions due to output of
  character code 128.
* Added SearchJob.UnindexedSearchFlags in the .NET API and SearchJob.setUnindexedSearchFlags in the Java API
  to enable case and accent-sensitive unindexed searches in these APIs
* Added .NET SearchFilter.GetItems() to provide access to an array of the doc ids selected in a SearchFilter
* File parser bug fixes affecting Office XML drawings embedded in Word, PowerPoint, and Excel files;
  interpretation of OEM character codes (\_x00NN\_) in Excel 2007 files; dates prior to 1970 in MDB files;
  performance and memory use parsing MIME files; Word auto-numbering; PDF
* Other bug fixes.

## dtSearch 7.65 (Build 7907) September 14, 2010

  adding documents" box is checked in the Update Index dialog box
* Fixed file parser bug affecting indexing of QuickBooks backup (\*.qbb) files

## dtSearch 7.65 (Build 7906) August 20, 2010

### dtSearch Engine

* Added dtsoFfSkipEmailHeaders flag for Options.FieldFlags to suppress searching and display of headers in
  MIME and Outlook messages

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* Reduced memory requirements for parsing very large XLS files
* Fixed bug that allowed XML output from saved search results and XML generated by conversion to
  it\_ContentAsXml to contain the colon (":") character in tag names, which caused the generated XML to fail
  validation.
* Fixed PDF hit highlighting error affecting documents using ActualText parameter.
* Automatic date recognition has been changed to limit the scope of automatically recognized entities so they
  will not cross a field boundary.
* Fixed error in HTML conversion causing some output to fail to word-wrap when displayed in a browser.
* Fixed memory leak in searches that use the dtsSearchLanguageAnalyzerSynonyms flag.
* ZIP file parser applies default encoding in filetype.xml when interpreting ambiguous ZIP filenames, and

* Fixed PDF hit highlighting errors in certain types of corrupt PDF files
* Other bug fixes.

## dtSearch 7.64 (Build 7876) March 15, 2010

### dtSearch Engine

* Added dtsSearchLanguageAnalyzerSynonyms flag to enable using a language analyzer to generate morphological
  variations on a search term at search time. When this flag is set, the language analyzer is called for each
  word or phrase in the search request. The flag dtsLaInputIsSearchTerm is passed to the language analyzer in
  dtsLaJob.flags, so the language analyzer knows why it is being called.
* Added dtssGetWordBreaker API function to provide direct access to the dtSearch Engine's internal word
  breaker using the language analyzer API. For sample code demonstrating how to use this API, see the
  WordBreak example in examples\vc8\WordBreak.
* Added more structural information to the output generated by conversion to the it\_ContentAsXml file format.
* Added to COM interface: WordListBuilder.ListFieldValues, WordListBuilder.SetFilter, and
  IndexJob.EnumerableFields.
* Added dtsListIndexSkipNoiseWords flag for ListIndexJob to list words in an index without including any noise
  words.
* Added dtsoFfSkipDataSourceFields flag for Options.FieldFlags to prevent DocFields values from appearing in
  FileConverter output

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* Fixed incorrect display of CreationDate and ModDate properties in PDF files
* Fixed incorrect hit highlighting when Unicode Filtering options at search time different from options used
  to index a file. To ensure consistent options, Unicode Filtering options are stored in the index when the
  index is created, in the index\_a.ix file.
* Fixed error updating index when directory specified for temporary files is inaccessible.
* Fixed index merge bug causing "Inconsistent doc ids from target index" error during merge.
* Fixed two search report bugs causing incorrect hit highlighting.
* Improved formatting of documents converted from Ami Pro and Quattro Pro to HTML
* Added automatic detection of gb2312 and JIS encoding.
* Added automatic detection of XyWrite, XBase, WordStar 3.x, and WordPerfect 4.2 and TAR files.
* Improved reporting of file types by FileConverter.DetectedTypeId, providing much more specific information
  about Microsoft Word versions and adding type detection for additional file formats
* Added support for text extraction from Adobe Framemaker MIF, XFA form templates in PDF files, and Visio XML
  files
* Fixed "Excessive nesting" error indexing OpenOffice document due to bug parsing table structure
* Fixed RTF file parser bug affecting handling of the \upr tag
* Other file parser bug fixes affecting Multimate, Lotus 1-2-3, PDF, Word, PowerPoint
* Other bug fixes.

## dtSearch 7.63 (Build 7836) October 29, 2009

### Fixes

* Fixed problem running dtSearch.exe on some systems after installing the kb973923 patch from Windows Update.
* Fixed missing checkboxes in dtWebSetup64.exe under Windows Server 2008

### Compatibility notes for developers working with the .NET 2.0 API only

* In dtSearch 7.63, the DLL dependencies for dtSearchNetApi2.dll have changed due to the release of the Visual
  Studio .NET 2005 Service Pack 1 Security Update for ATL.   Because dtSearchNetApi2.dll is built
  with the updated version of Visual Studio .NET 2005, it requires the updated MFC and CRT DLLs that are
  included with that version.
   This issue does not affect any other dtSearch Engine API.
* This Microsoft redistributable program will install the required components:
   Microsoft Visual C++ 2005
  Service Pack 1 Redistributable Package ATL Security Update (July 28, 2009)

  IIndexStatusHandler callback interface during indexing.
* Added dtsnIndexDeletedFileRemoved, dtsnIndexListedFileRemoved, and dtsnIndexListedFileNotRemoved
  notifications to the indexing status callbacks to notify the calling application when files are removed from
  the index during indexing or when an attempt to remove a listed file fails.
* *Compatibility note for developers working with the .NET 2.0 API only*:  The DLL dependencies for
  dtSearchNetApi2.dll have changed due to the release of the Visual Studio .NET 2005 Service Pack 1 Security
  Update for ATL.   Because dtSearchNetApi2.dll is built with the updated version of Visual Studio
  .NET 2005, it requires the updated MFC and CRT DLLs that are included with that version.  This

  it works identically under Windows and Linux. This file parser supports Access databases created by
  Microsoft Access 95 through Access 2007.
* New file parser added for Flash (\*.swf) files.

### dtSearch Engine

* Added support for searching for Unicode characters that are not defined as letters by default (such as
  currency symbols)
   By default, all Unicode characters that are defined as letters in the Unicode
  specification are searchable. To make other characters such as Unicode currency characters searchable, you
  can add a line to the end of the alphabet file listing the Unicode characters to make searchable.
  Example:
  ```
  AdditionalLetters = 00a2 00a3 00a4 00a5 20a0 20a1 20a2 20a3 20a4 20a5 20a6 20a7 20a8 20a9 20aa 20ab 20ac

  ```
  This example makes all of the Unicode currency characters such as the Euro, Pound, and Lira searchable
  characters.
* Added ListIndexFlags.dtsListIndexIncludeDocInfoAsXml flag to list all documents in an index in XML format
  including document properties and stored fields. The ListIndex.exe utility also has a new dx option to do
  this for an index from the command-line.

### dtSearch Publish

* Added option to enable links to Office documents (doc, xls, etc.) to launch in Office, outside of the
  lbview.exe program. The setting is "ExternalLaunchExtensions" in the lbview.ini file.
* See below for important information about Adobe Reader and Adobe Acrobat 9 compatibility

### Adobe Reader and Adobe Acrobat 9 Compatibility

* Adobe Reader and Adobe Acrobat 9 have a new setting that disables hit highlighting in PDF files by default.
  To change this setting in Adobe Reader or Adobe Acrobat 9, click Edit > Preferences > Search, and
  check the box to "Enable search highlights from external highlight server".
* dtSearch Desktop 7.54 will automatically make this change when it detects that hit highlighting is disabled
  (after asking permission). dtSearch Desktop 7.54 also fixes a problem that causes PDF files to open very
  slowly in dtSearch with Adobe Reader or Adobe Acrobat 9 installed.
* dtSearch Publish 7.54 has new settings in the lbview.ini file to automatically enable PDF hit highlighting
  when it is disabled (after asking permission).
* dtSearch Web cannot change this setting in client applications, so web sites that rely on Adobe Reader to
  highlight hits in PDF files should notify users of the need to change this setting to preserve hit
  highlighting.

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* dten600.dll: Outlook .msg file parser added separate table of bcc and cc recipients at end of message
* dten600.dll: Fixed error generating search reports with the "include whole file option" selected

### dtSearch Engine

* 64-bit Java API
* 64-bit version of the dtSearch Engine for Linux
* Option to [index .eml files as containers](http://support.dtsearch.com/faq/dts0219.htm) (so the
  message body and attachments are each indexed as a separate file).
* Sample ASP.NET application implementing an OpenSearch interface to the dtSearch Engine

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* dten600.dll: To improve consistency in the handling of punctuation in field names, unsearchable characters
  are now removed from field names in input data, with a few exceptions (:&\_+=.) to minimize the effect on
  backward compatibility. In previous versions this was done in indivdual file parsers so the effect of
  punctuation in field names depended on the format of the input data.
  This change will not generally
  affect searching because only searchable letters are used when matching field names.
  This change may
  affect the field names associated with [stored
  fields](http://support.dtsearch.com/faq/dts0109.htm), in cases where the field name contains punctuation characters.
* dten600.dll: Fixed two bugs affecting field parsing in Office 2007 documents.

  during a crawl
* Added dtsLaJob.searchRequestPunct string advising external language analyzers of the search request
  punctuation characters to preserve when analyzing a search request
* dtSearchNetApi2.dll: If data source throws an exception, IndexJob will catch it and report the exception
  through the Errors object
* dtSearchNetApi2.dll: Added FileInfoFlags.fiOpenFailed to indicate when a document returned from a DataSource
  with the DocIsFile flag set to true cannot be opened because it is either not present or locked
* dten600.dll: Fixed merge bug affecting merges of indexes containing the same container file with the newer
  version of the container file in the target index

## dtSearch 7.51 (Build 7556) January 18, 2008

### dtSearch Desktop

* Search results saved as XML include the selection state of the items in the search results list (i.e.,
  checked or unchecked). Search results saved in other formats such as CSV can either include all items or
  just selected items.

### dtSearch Web

* Added 64-bit version of dtSearch Web and dtSearch Web Setup

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* dtSearch.Spider2.dll: Added 64-bit version of the .NET Spider API

  to be included in the generated report.
* lbvprot.dll: Fixed error starting CGI applications

## dtSearch 7.50 (Build 7517) November 9, 2007

### Enhancements (All products)

* Improved integration with external language analyzers: (1) Language analyzers will be given much larger
  chunks of text to analyze, which enables some language analyzers to operate more effectively. (2) Language
  analyzers will be given consistently-sized chunks of text whether indexing or highlighting hits, which
  ensures that hit highlighting will not be affected by changes in the behavior of a language analyzer
  depending on the size of the data it receives.

### dtSearch Desktop

* In the **Edit > Copy File** dialog box, added option to preserve original modification, creation, and
  last access times of the original files

* dtsjava.dll: Fixed error indexing using data source API under WebSphere
* dten600.dll: Fixed extra spacing in output when HTML converted to UTF-8 text

## dtSearch 7.42 (Build 7467) July 31, 2007

### Enhancements (All products)

* Added support for Microsoft Searchable TIFF (created by Microsoft Office Imaging), Microsoft Document
  Imaging (\*.mdi), Windows Metafile \*.wmf) and Enhanced Metafile (\*.emf) formats

### Enhancements (dtSearch Engine)

* Added flags to control recognition of ambiguous dates (new TextFlags values dtsoTfRecognizeDatesPresumeDMY,
  dtsoTfRecognizeDatesPresumeYMD)

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* dtSearchNetApi2.dll: JobErrorInfo no longer requires or supports the IDisposable interface.
* dten600.dll: Filenames longer than 1024 characters could cause "duplicate filename" errors when verifying an
  index.
* dtSearchw.exe: Fixed problem with mouse wheel scrolling in search results window with high-resolution mouse
  wheels
* dten600.dll: Improved recognition of CJK encodings in HTML and PDF
* dten600.dll: Fixed error in title attribute for documents indexed using the COM implementation of the data
  source API
* dten600.dll: Changed the behavior when a container document such as a ZIP file is removed from an index
  using its doc id (using IndexJob.ActionRemoveListed). Instead of just removing the container, the container
  and all contained items will be removed.
* dten600.dll: MS Word file parser displayed some internal field data (TC, TA, SEQ)
* dten600.dll: Added detection of .docx, .xlsx, .xps, and OpenOffice documents with missing or incorrect
  filename extensions

## dtSearch 7.41 (Build 7420) April 21, 2007

### Enhancements (dtSearch Engine)

* Added support for automatically varying hit weights according to the field they occur in, through the new
  SearchJob.FieldWeights setting. For more information, see the "Relevance" topic in the dtSearch Engine API
  Reference.
* Added improved progress reporting during unindexed searches to the C++ API (see dtsSearchProgressInfo in the
  dtSearch Engine API Reference) and the .NET 2.0 API (see ISearchStatusHandler2 in the .NET 2.0 API
  Reference).
* Compatibility note for developers working with the .NET 2.0 API *only*:  The DLL dependencies for
  dtSearchNetApi2.dll have changed due to Visual Studio .NET 2005 Service Pack 1.   Because
  dtSearchNetApi2.dll is built with Service Pack 1, it requires the updated MFC and CRT DLLs that are included
  with that version.  Executing the vcredist\_x86.exe included with Visual Studio .NET 2005 Service Pack 1
  (dated December 2, 2006 or later) will install these components.
   This issue does not affect any
  other dtSearch Engine API.

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* dten600.dll: New fields added as properties of .eml files - CC, BCC, and Attachments (a list of the
  filenames of all attachments).
* dtSearch .exe and .msi files digitally signed for better operation in Windows Vista
* dtSearchNetApi2.dll: Error in ConvertPath caused unnecessary refresh of virtual path mappings from the
  metabase.
* dten600.dll: Minor improvements in the binary file detection and Unicode filtering algorithm for binary
  files
* dten600.dll: Fixed bug in MHT file parser that caused hit highlighter to generate blank HTML page for some
  MHT files
* dten600.dll: IndexCache object added to the COM interface.
* dtSearchw.exe: Fixed error starting indexer and dtSearch Web Setup under Windows Vista

## dtSearch 7.40 (Build 7360) February 22, 2007

### Enhancements (All products)

* Added automatic recognition of dates, email addresses, and credit card numbers in text. For more
  information, see http://www.dtsearch.com/dateRecog.html>
* Added support for Vista (XMP) metadata in .jpg and .tif images.
* Added support for PowerPoint 2007 (\*.pptx).
* Added support for Vista XML Paper Specification (\*.xps) documents.

### Enhancements (dtSearch Engine)

* Added IndexCache object in the .NET 2.0 API, and dtsIndexCache object in the C++ API, to enable much faster
  searching when a series of searches must be done against a small number of indexes. The IndexCache maintains
  a thread-safe pool of open indexes that are available for searching during the lifetime of the cache. Using
  the cache eliminates the need to open and close the index for each search

### Enhancements (dtSearch Desktop)

* Added option in **Options > Preferences > Spider Options** to log the links found in each page the
  Spider follows.
* Added option in **Options > Preferences > Search Options** to change the maximum number of words a
  search request can match.

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* dtSearch.exe: Fixed "Invalid Character" error displaying documents in report view after installing Internet
  Explorer 7.
* dten600.dll: When serializing stored fields to XML, add a \_ in front of any stored field names that begin
  with a digit so the resulting XML remains syntactically correct.
* dten600.dll: In the C++ API, the pOnIndexWordFn callback was called with encoded field information in
  addition to the text of the word, and if the called function did not preserve this field information intact,
  field attributes could become invalid. To prevent this, in version 7.40 the field information is removed
  before the callback so pOnIndexWordFn will not see or be able to affect field attributes.
* dten600.dll: Increased the maximum value for MaxWordsToRetrieve to 512k (from 256k)
* dten600.dll: When checking for available disk space in a folder, indexer did not check whether the folder
  was mounted from a different physical drive.
* dtSearch Web: Added option to log BooleanConditions and FileConditions to search log.
* dtindexerw.exe: Fixed MAPI\_E\_UNKNOWN\_FLAGS error indexing Outlook messages in Outlook 2002 (fixed in build
  7360)

## dtSearch 7.30 (Build 7320) September 30, 2006

### Enhancements (All products)

* Added preliminary support for Word 2007 (\*.docx) and Excel 2007 (\*.xlsx) based on the current Office 2007
  beta and available documentation.
* Added support for JPG and TIFF metadata, including EXIF and IPTC fields.
* Unicode filtering file parser can handle individual documents larger than 2 Gb, and support for files larger
  than 2 Gb added to the extext.exe utility
* Improved handling of partially inaccessible email files. In previous versions, if an email had encrypted or
  corrupt data (for example, an encrypted attachment), the whole email was reported as encrypted or corrupt.
  In this version, the readable portion of the message is indexed and the unreadable portion is separately
  reported as a partially encrypted or partially unreadable file. This change applies to Outlook messages,
  TNEF files, .eml files, MBOX archives, and .msg files.

### Enhancements (dtSearch Engine)

* Beta x64 (64-bit) versions of the dtSearch Indexer and dtSearch Engine (dtIndexer64.exe, dtengine64.dll, and
  dtSearchNetApi2.dll. The index format and APIs (C++, COM, and .NET) are identical to the 32-bit version. The
  64-bit components are in a separate download file (dtSearch64\_730.exe) with the same installation password
  as the dtSearch Engine SDK.
* Added alternative PDF highlighting mechanism for client-based applications (see "Highlighting Hits in PDF
  files" in the API Overviews section for details)
* Added ListIndexJob object to the .NET 2.0 API to list files, words, or fields in an index (see
  dtSearchNetApi2.chm for API reference)
* Added dtsListIndexIncludeDocId flag for dtsListIndexJob and ListIndexJob to provide a quick way to list all
  documents in an index and the doc id for each document
* C++ API Changes to support 64-bit file sizes in dtsInputStream (added size64 and seek64),
  dtsInputStreamReader, dtsFileInfo (added size64), dtsSearchResultsItem (added size64). These changes
  preserve binary compatibility for the dtSearch Engine DLL, but some C++ code may trigger new warnings when
  compiled because of 64-bit values returned.
* Added dtsIndexKeepExistingDocIds flag to specify that, when compressing an index, the indexer should not
  remap document ids, so document ids will be unmodified in the index once compression is done.

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* dtWebSetup.exe: Fixed bug causing "Build Search Form" tool to create extra button bar when overwriting an
  existing form
* dten600.dll: Fixed 'out of memory' error verifying very large index
* lbviewer.exe: Fixed bug causing XML to appear incorrectly when displayed using a stylesheet
* dten600.dll: PowerPoint file parser - added support for embedded OLE objects
* dten600.dll: PDF file parser detects and handles case where text in right-to-left languages (Hebrew or
  Arabic) is stored backwards (left-to-right) in a PDF file, and automatically inverts the characters in the
  word so it will be correctly searchable
* dten600.dll: PDF file parser handles invalid PDF files created by OCR product that leaves out required
  /Pages and /Page tags in PDF structure
* dtSearchNetApi2.dll: JobErrorInfo object did not implement IDisposable interface, preventing deterministic
  release of allocated resources.

## dtSearch 7.25 (Build 7285) June 25, 2006

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* dtWebSetup.exe: Fixed bug causing dtSearch Web Setup to fail to run on some Windows 2003 Server systems
* dten600.dll: Added Fragmentation, ObsoleteCount, and IndexFlags to the COM IndexJob.GetIndexInfo() and Java
  IndexJob.getIndexInfo() methods. Also, indexing dates are now reported as a date and time.

* dten600.dll: Excel file parsing bug caused indexer to hang on corrupt Excel file
* mapitool.exe: Added workaround for MAPI error MAPI\_E\_NOT\_ENOUGH\_MEMORY when saving a message that has a very
  large number of recipients (see http://support.microsoft.com/kb/171907).
* dten600.dll: RTF parser - fixed bug parsing headers in RTF files
* dten600.dll: Improved parsing of Ole10Native streams in OLE Storage files
* C++ Source code samples reorganized into vc6, vc7, and vc8 folders
* dten600.dll: Fixed PDF hit-highlighting bug that caused highlighting to fail to appear in some documents

## dtSearch 7.23 (Build 7241) May 8, 2006

  to force deterministic release of memory allocated for SearchResults

### Fixes

* dten600.dll: PowerPoint file parsing bug caused incorrect character formatting
* dten600.dll: Word file parsing bug caused right-to-left text to be left-aligned instead of right-aligned by
  default.
* dten600.dll: EML parser - improved detection and parsing of malformed .eml files.
* mapitool.exe: Fixed error converting UTC date when saving .msg files to disk
* dten600.dll: Fixed crash indexing corrupt .mp3 file
* libdten600.so (Linux): Fixed error parsing zipped files with accented characters in the filename
* dtsearch.exe: Fixed error detecting Ctrl+C keyboard shortcut
* dten600.dll: Excel file parser bug caused some valid XLS files to be incorrectly reported as corrupt

## dtSearch 7.22 (Build 7217) March 14, 2006

### Enhancements (dtSearch Engine)

* .NET 2.0 API for Visual Studio .NET 2005. The .NET 2.0 API wrapper is dtSearchNetApi2.dll, and the .NET 2.0
  version of the Spider API is dtSearch.Spider2.dll. The API is identical to the .NET 1.1 API. For sample
  code, see the examples\cs2 and examples\vb.net2 folders.
* Added dtsSortByFullName sort flag
* Added docByteRead64, bytesRead64, bytesToIndex64 to dtsIndexProgressInfo
* Added Options.StoredFieldDelimiterChar, which provides a way to specify a delimiter between multiple
  instances of a stored field in a single document

### Enhancements (dtSearch Desktop)

* Added option to dtSearch to view PDF files as plain text instead of using Adobe Reader (Options >
  Preferences > External Viewers).

### Fixes

  verified
* dten600.dll: Fixed Excel file parser bugs affecting formatting of date and time values
* dten600.dll: Fixed indexing crash when indexing very large .gz files
* dten600.dll: Minor improvements to word break detection in PDF files
* dten600.dll: Fixed RTF file parser bug that could cause indexing crash on corrupt RTF file
* dten600.dll: Excel file parser defaults to 10 digits of precision for numbers without a specified format
  (consistent with Excel).
* dten600.dll: Minor improvements to Unicode filtering algorithm.

## dtSearch 7.21 (Build 7164) January 23, 2006

### Enhancements (All products)

* IFilter support to enable dtSearch to parse document types such as Microsoft OneNote and AutoCAD that
  include IFilters.
   IFilters are components that enable various Microsoft search
  products, such as Microsoft Index Server, to extract text from documents. For example, when you install
  Microsoft OneNote, an IFilter is installed to enable searching of \*.one files. To tell dtSearch to use
  installed IFilters to process some of your files, set up a rule in Options > Preferences > File Types
  and under File type, select "IFilter". In dtSearch Engine applications, use the FileTypeTableFile to specify
  the filename patterns to use with IFilters. The IFilter adapter only works on systems with the Microsoft
  component query.dll installed.
   For information on products that include query.dll, see
  http://support.microsoft.com/dllhelp

### Fixes

* dten600.dll: Fixed bug that prevented some items in ZIP files from being displayed after a search (an
  "unable to access input file" message would appear instead).
* dten600.dll: Fixed bug in file parsers for Microsoft Office documents (PowerPoint, Excel, and Word) that
  could cause dtSearch to crash attempting to index corrupt documents
* dten600.dll: Fixed bug in PDF file parser that caused "Bad xref" error on some PDF files created with PDF
  1.5-only compatibility
* dtsearch.h: unnamed unions removed from the dtsMessage structure. This will not affect binary compatibility
  but may require source code changes in C++ code that accessed undocumented union members. Because the
  removed union members were undocumented, this change should affect very few programs.

## dtSearch 7.20 (Build 7136) December 6, 2005

### Enhancements (All products)

* New file parsers for OpenOffice documents, spreadsheets, and presentations (\*.sxw, \*.sxc, \*.odt, \*.ods,
  etc.), covering OpenOffice version 1 and OpenOffice version 2 (the "Open Document Format for Office
  Applications")
* New file parsers for the Microsoft Office XML formats (Microsoft Word 2003 XML and Microsoft Excel 2003 XML)

### Enhancements (dtSearch Desktop)

* Added "Opening containing folder" in right-click menu for retrieved items
* Improved reporting of errors that occur when copying files in Edit > Copy File(s)
* dtindexer.exe: added /caf and /cat command-line option to cache text (/cat) or cache original files (/cad),
  when creating indexes using the command line, and /recog to recognize an index.
* Added **Help > Check For Updates** feature to automatically download new versions

### Enhancements (dtSearch Engine)

* dtSearch.Spider.dll component provides a .NET API for the dtSearch Spider. For API documentation, see
  dtSearchNetApi.chm. For sample code, see
  C:\Program Files\dtSearch Developer\examples\cs\SpiderDemo.
* New xfilter search type, "ext", to search only on the filename extension (dot required). Examples:
  `xfilter(ext ".doc")` matches file with a .doc extension; `xfilter(ext "~.doc")`
  matches file without a .doc extension; `xfilter(ext ".")` matches file with no extension. This
  search feature will only work with documents that were indexed with dtSearch 7.2 or later.
* SearchReport supports %%FirstHit%% macro in ContextHeader to indicate the word offset of the first hit in
  the context block
* dtsIndexCacheTextWithoutFields flag added to IndexingFlags. This flag makes it possible to cache text (for
  generation of a synopsis to include in search results) without including any of the fields added using the
  data source API.
* dtsErAccCachedDoc flag added to ErrorCodes. This error code indicates that a document could not be extracted
  from the document cache in an index (this usually means that the index was created without caching enabled)
* dtsConvertJustDetectType flag added to ConvertFlags, to have FileConverter or DFileConvertJob just detect
  the file format of a document. The format is returned in FileConverter.DetectedTypeId.
* dtSearch Engine for Linux updated to the dtSearch 7.2 code base; multithreading support added
* dtsReportIncludeFileStart flag added to ReportFlags. This flag causes a block of text from the beginning of
  the document to be included in the generated search report.
* A new search feature makes it possible to restrict a search to the text of documents (excluding any
  metadata). To search for text that is not in any field, search for //text contains (search request).
  Example: `(//text contains apple) and (author contains smith)`

### Fixes

* DynaZip unzip component (dunzip32.dll) updated to new version that eliminates buffer overrun vulnerability
  in earlier versions.
* dtSearch.exe: Installing Adobe Acrobat 7.05 update caused hit highlighting to stop working in PDF files
* dten600.dll: Reduced amount of memory needed to parse very large Word, Excel, and Outlook items
* dten600.dll: Fixed file parsing error in Word documents that caused bullets to be rendered as auto-numbered
  lists
* dten600.dll: Changed handling of CSV files that do not have a header that lists field names; these files are
  now handled as plain text, since no field information is available for them.
* Spider: Fixed: Links with // in the name (http://www.example.com//default.html) caused index to be reported
  as corrupt by Verify Index
* dtSearch.exe: MAPI profile id, entry id, and store id were displayed in search results list
* dtSearch Web: WebSearchForm.js incorrectly handled blank filename filter
* Spider:  Did not match port number against filename filters for port numbers other than 80
* dtSearch.exe:  Displayed MAPI entry id and store id of Outlook messages in search results.

## dtSearch 7.10 (Build 7045) August 8, 2005

### Enhancements (dtSearch Engine)

* Added two new ASP.NET samples, one in VB.NET and one in C#, that demonstrate a search interface using a grid
  control for search results. The new samples are installed to C:\Program Files\dtSearch
  Developer\examples\asp.net. Please see the readme file in the project folders before trying to open them in
  Visual Studio -- a virtual directory mapping for C:\Program Files\dtSearch Developer\examples\asp.net has to
  be created first or Visual Studio will not be able to open the project.
* GetNthWordDocCount added to WordListBuilder to get the number of documents a word occurs in
* SearchReportJob enhancements: Added ContextSeparator; itUnformattedHTML output format, for easier generation
  of a synopsis; faster generation of search report when search results cover multiple indexes;
  dtsReportLimitContiguousContext flag to prevent very large synopsis when there are many hits close together.
* In the OnFound callback notification in the C++ and .NET interfaces, an application can veto individual
  items to prevent them from being included in search results. See SearchResultsItem.VetoThisItem (.NET) and
  DSearchJob::VetoThisItem (C++ Support Classes).* dtSearchNetApi.dll uses registry type library information and delay loading to eliminate the need for
    dten600.dll to reside on the system PATH in ASP.NET applications.* New TextFlags option to suppress automatic generation of xfirstword and xlastword (dtsoTfSkipXFirstAndLast)* Options.MaxFieldNesting setting to limit the permissible depth of field nesting
      * .NET API objects implement Dispose() for more deterministic release of allocated resources.
      * .NET IndexJob.ExecuteInThread and SearchJob.ExecuteInThread use .NET thread pool instead of creating a
        thread.
      * dtSearch Engine for Linux updated to the dtSearch 7.1 code base

### Enhancements (dtSearch Publish)

* "Standard" CDs (which use lbview.exe) can launch non-CGI programs from the CGI-BIN folder using a new URL
  syntax. See the "Standard CDs" help topic in dtSearch\_Web.chm for details.
* "Standard" CDs can highlight hits in PDF files with Adobe Reader 6 or later (formerly Adobe Reader 7 was
  required).

### Fixes

* dten600.dll: Reduced amount of stack required to process very long xfilter expressions
* dten600.dll: Fixed index merge bug that could cause a corrupt index merging into a large index without the
  "clear target" flag set
* dten600.dll: Bug caused MakePdfWebHighlightFile to return a blank string after unindexed search
* dten600.dll: The default value of Options.MatchDigitChar has changed from blank (disabled) to '=', to be
  consistent with the behavior of dtSearch Desktop.
* dten600.dll: Bug caused unindexed search of HTML field defined using comment tags to find the same search
  term outside of the field

## dtSearch 7.01 (Build 7025) June 14, 2005

### Enhancements (dtSearch Web)

* Generated search form has more flexible stylesheet references
* File parsers generate HTML output using "em" units for font sizes instead of points, which allows font sizes
  to scale up or down in Internet Explorer

### Enhancements (dtSearch Publish)

* Added "Recognize CD" function to use the CD Wizard to modify a CD that was created on a different computer

### Fixes

* dten600.dll: MS Word file parser caused a word break when MS Word inserted redundant font changes within a
  word
* lbview.exe: Error opening PDF file with URL-encoded apostrophe in filename or path
* dten600.dll: PowerPoint file parser error parsing slide without outline entry text
* dtSearchNetApi.dll: SearchResultsItem did not include modified date or type id
* dten600.dll: SearchResults did not read HitsByWord when serializing from XML
* dtSearch Publish: PDF files did not highlight hits in Adobe Reader 7 in some systems with unpatched versions
  of IE components.
* dtIndexer.exe:  Default setting for IndexAutoCommitIntervalMB forced large index updates to commit too
  frequently, making indexing slower.

## dtSearch 7.00 (Build 7008) May 18, 2005

### Enhancements (All products)

* [High-capacity index format](http://www.dtsearch.com/index7.html) released, with support for
  over 1 terabyte of data per index.
   dtSearch 7 can update and search indexes created with dtSearch 6.

   To upgrade an index to the version 7 format using dtSearch Desktop, (1) click Index > Update
  Index..., (2) Check the box to "Upgrade index to version 7 format". (3) Click "Start Indexing"
* New variable field weighting search option. Example: "(Description:5 contains (apple and pear)) or (author:2
  contains smith)"

### Enhancements (dtSearch Desktop)

* Added Spider option to pause between page downloads, to reduce them impact on the server of a crawl
* PDF files open faster in Adobe Reader if Adobe Reader 7 is installed

### Enhancements (dtSearch Publish)

* A new file-based CD interface has been added that does not rely on HTTP.
* The CD Wizard has been simplified

### Fixes

* dtSearchNetApi.dll: repeated instances of first element returned in HitsByWord array
* dten600.dll: Hidden stored fields (fields with names prefixed by \*\*) were stored with the \*\* mark in front
  of the field name, causing serialized XML search results to have incorrect XML syntax
* dten600.dll: Check for available disk space did not handle volume sizes larger than 2 Terabytes
* mapitool.exe:  several minor bug fixes
* dten600.dll: MS Word file parser did not handle FORMTEXT fields
* dtSearch.exe: fixed 800a025e error from Internet Explorer when dtSearch tries to select hidden text to
  highlight from a Word document
* dten600.dll: Fixed PDF file parser error counting words in pages with annotations, causing incorrect
  highlighting
* dten600.dll: Fixed hit highlighting error in MIME files

# dtSearch Release Notes

**Disclaimer**: This information is provided subject to the license agreement accompanying the
products described and to the **[terms of use](http://www.dtsearch.com/TermsOfUse.html)** of this web site, and
does not constitute an additional warranty. dtSearch makes no warranty of any kind with regard to this information.
## dtSearch 2024.02 (Build 8821) Released September 30, 2024

### All Products

* *Multithreaded Indexing*
  Added support for building indexes using multiple threads, greatly improving
  indexing speed on 64-bit Windows and Linux systems with multiple cores. At least 16 Gb of memory is
  required.
   In dtSearch Desktop/Network, click Options > Preferences > Indexing Resources to enable this
  option.
   For information on using multithreaded indexing in the API, please see  [Multithreaded Operations](https://support.dtsearch.com/faq/dts0233.htm) .
   Multithreaded indexing had
  previously been available as a "preview" feature.

### Fixes/Minor Enhancements

* Updated included Zlib version to 1.3.1, Unrar to 7.1, and ICU to 74.2 (Windows and Linux).
* Fixed dtSearch Desktop Options > Preferences > Search Results bug causing the Column Sizes setting not to
  be remembered if the compact resizable version of the Preferences dialog box is enabled
* In documents with footnotes, added a link back to the footnote reference to the footnote text.
* Fixed .NET Core API bug causing the IndexInfo.Flags property not to be populated.
* File parser bug fixes affecting: PDF, WordPerfect
* Other bug fixes

## dtSearch 2024.01 (Build 8815) Released March 30, 2024

### dtSearch Desktop/Network

* Accessibility improvements:
  + New "Accessibility Options" page in Options > Preferences with options to improve operation of
    dtSearch with screen readers.
  + New optional compact resizable dialog boxes, which you can enable or disable in the
    Accessibility Options page. At high text magnification levels, the standard dtSearch dialog boxes can be
    too large to work with. By default, dtSearch will use compact resizable dialog boxes in this situation,
    which can be resized and are organized to take up less screen space.
  + "Make text larger" setting in Windows is now recognized and applied to menus, search results, dialog
    boxes, and default document window zoom. The application must be closed and restarted for the change to
    take effect. This is an alternative to the existing option to directly control the dialog box font size
    in Options > Dialog Box Font Size.
  + To provide better keyboard navigation among the dtSearch Search components (the menu, the Search dialog
    box, the list of search results, the document and the Document Information sidebar window), new keyboard
    shortcuts and menu options have been added to provide direct navigation using the keyboard. Menu options
    corresponding to these shortcuts are in View > Go to window. The keyboard shortcuts are: Ctrl+Alt+M -
    Main menu.
    Ctrl+Alt+D - Document, Ctrl+Alt+R - Search results, Ctrl+Y - Document info, Ctrl+S - Search dialog box).
  + Easier tab navigation of the Options > Preferences dialog box* New minimum system requirements: Windows versions 8 through 11 and Windows Server versions 2012 and later.

### dtSearch Engine

* Added arm64 and arm64ec versions of the dtSearch Engine DLL for Windows. Unlike the x64 version, the arm64 and arm64ec
  versions include the [crypto-enabled
  PDF file parser](https://support.dtsearch.com/webhelp/dtSearchCppApi/Installing_the_dtSearch_Engine.html#:~:text=Export%20Notice%20and%20Encryption%C2%A0). The arm64 and arm64ec versions use the same C++ API as the x64 version.

### Fixes/Minor Enhancements

* Added support for GPS metadata (latitude, longitude, altitude) in
  JPG files
* File parser bug fixes affecting PPTX (["modern
  comments"](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/modern-comments-in-powerpoint-c0aa37bb-82cb-414c-872d-178946ff60ec) support added), PDF
* Other bug fixes

## dtSearch 2023.02 (Build 8806) Released October 24, 2023

### All Products

* Image/Sound/Video metadata improvements: Added new file format support for OGG (Vorbis metadata), OPUS (Vorbis metadata), FLAC (Vorbis metadata),
  WAV (RIFF and XMP metadata), AIFF (RIFF and XMP metadata), WEBP (RIFF and XMP metadata), AVI (RIFF and XMP metadata), HEIF (EXIF and XMP metadata), APE (APEv2 and XMP metadata),
  PNG (XMP, IPTC, and EXIF metadata), GIF (XMP metadata). Added XMP to existing metadata support for MP4, TIF, MP3, MOV, WMA/WMV.
  Image files continue to have an "Image Format" field that specifies the file format and categories of
  metadata found (EXIF, IPTC, XMP, etc.). Sound and video files have a new "Media Format"
  field with this information.

### dtSearch Engine

* Added sample code demonstrating use of the dtSearch Engine in an ASP.NET Core application running in a Docker container under Windows (NanoServer)
  and Linux. See the [dtsearch]\examples\Docker folder and the readme-dtSearch-docker.md file in the application folders.
* Added sample code demonstrating how to build NuGet packages to deploy the dtSearch Engine with associated dependencies including ICU, CMAP files, stemming rules,
  and the external file parsers. See the [dtsearch]\examples\NuGet folder.
* Added to C++ API: dtssGetIndexInfo2, which is the same as dtssGetIndexInfo but also provides an error code and diagnostic message when an index cannot be accessed.

### Fixes/Minor Enhancements

* Updated RAR file parser to the current version of the Rarlab source (6.2.10 released August 1, 2023). dtSearch uses source code from Rarlab to implement content extraction from RAR archives.

  Note:
  [Rarlab reports](https://rarlab.com/rarnew.htm) that the updated source fixes two security vulnerabilities. Based on information available about vulnerabilities, we do not believe they affect any dtSearch product.
  (1) CVE-2023-40477 (out of bounds write) affects RAR recovery volumes. RAR recovery volumes have a .rev extension and a different binary header from RAR archives, so dtSearch will not invoke the RAR file processing code if it encounters a RAR4 recovery volume. Additionally, the code to process recovery volumes is disabled in the RAR extraction code that dtSearch uses. This [Rarlab article](https://www.rarlab.com/vuln_rev3_names.html) states that unrar.dll is not affected by the vulnerability, and the unrar.dll source code is what dtSearch uses in its RAR file parser.
  (2) CVE-2023-38831 (launching of an incorrect file) is associated with the WinRAR user interface and does not affect dtSearch.
* dtSearch Desktop Index Manager index properties window displays open error message instead of blank index properties when an index cannot be opened
* Fixed search performance bug that could cause reduced search speed during phrase searches involving extremely large documents
* Fixed incorrect handling of the Unicode soft hyphen character (U+00AD), which should
  be ignored during searches because it is not indexed.
* Fixed bug that could cause duplicate field name errors when documents
  include field names with certain CJK diacritical characters. Verifying an index will indicate if an index is affected. Affected indexes should be rebuilt.
* Text log files history.ix, dtSearchIndexingHistory.log, and indexlog.dat now format dates YYYY/MM/DD instead of MM/DD/YYYY
* File parser bug fixes affecting: DOCX, PDF
* In dtSearch Desktop the Options > Create group policy dialog creates an MSI file
  that places the registry keys under HKMU instead of HKCU or HKLM, so you can
  control at installation time whether the installation is per-user or per-machine.
  To install per-machine, specify ALLUSERS=2 and run the .msi with administrator permissions.
* Fixed time zone bug in the Linux indexer causing documents to be reindexed unnecessarily during an incremental index update.
* Added option in dtSearch Desktop in Options > Preferences > Indexing Resources to "Ask Windows to keep
  computer awake during indexing" (to prevent automatic sleep from blocking scheduled updates)./li>* Other bug fixes

## dtSearch 2023.01 (Build 8790) Released June 5, 2023

### dtSearch Desktop/Network

* New search results control. Improvements include:
  + Long text can wrap within columns
  + "First hits in context" display is faster and more efficient, and now appears in a wrapped column instead of a separate row.
  + Improved sorting performance
  + Updated appearance
  + Right-click any column header to quickly access search results format functions
  + ![Fit-Content/Fit-Window toggle button](data:image/png;base64...)
    Click a toolbar button or press Ctrl+Num-/ to toggle between "Fit-Content" and "Fit-Window" mode.
  + The old control is still available -- check the box to "Use older dtSearch 7.x search results control" in Options >
    Preferences > Search Results.* Added an option in Options > Preferences > Document Display to control whether HTML files are displayed with a <base> tag referencing the original document location. Enable this option to make relative links to other files or images stored with the original document work in search results. However, this will also cause internal bookmark links in the document to also reference the original file rather than the hit-highlighted version.

### dtSearch Engine

* WebDemo sample ASP.NET Core application updated to support configuring multiple search forms using the appSettings.json file

### Fixes/Minor Enhancements

* Fixed bug in beta/preview multithreaded indexer that could cause deleted documents not to be removed from an index during an update.
* Fixed bug in dtSearch Desktop in the old 7.x search results control causing misalignment of data in search results columns after repositioning a column.
* Fixed bug causing out-of-memory error verifying an index
* File parser bug fixes affecting: PDF, MSG
* Other bug fixes

## dtSearch 2022.02 (Build 8775) Released December 1, 2022

### dtSearch Desktop/Network

* Added built-in stemming rules and noise word lists for over 25 European languages.
* Added option in Search dialog box to select language to use for stemming.
* Added option in Options > Preferences > Letters and Words to select language to use for noise words.
* Added option in Options > Preferences > Indexing Resources to control number of threads used
  for multi-threaded indexing

### dtSearch Engine

* WebDemo sample ASP.NET Core application updated to require .NET Core 6 and current versions of Bootstrap and JQuery
* Stemming rules and noise word lists for over 25 European languages are included in the dtSearch Data folder.

### Fixes/Minor Enhancements

* Updated zlib source code to 1.12.13. Note: Zlib reports that this version fixed zlib CVE-2022-37434 ("zlib through 1.2.12 has a heap-based buffer over-read or buffer overflow in inflate in inflate.c via a large gzip header extra field. NOTE: only applications that call inflateGetHeader are affected. Some common applications bundle the affected zlib source code but may be unable to call inflateGetHeader"). dtSearch does not use the inflateGetHeader function so based on this information we do not believe this vulnerability affected any dtSearch products.
* Fixed bug in beta/preview multithreaded indexer that could cause a corrupt index to be generated if the underscore character is changed to a word break character in the alphabet settings.
* Fixed dtSearch Desktop search dialog box bug causing search dialog box to close when a search finds no documents.
* Fixed dtSearch Desktop search dialog box bug causing "More search options" dialog box to clear all criteria from previous search between searches.
* Fixed dtSearch Desktop search results display causing modification times to incorrectly reflect daylight savings times (earlier or later by one hour)
* Improved View > Document Information display, shown as a dockable sidebar instead of a pop-up and with better formatting of information.
* File parser bug fixes affecting: DOCX, WordStar, PDF
* Exceptions thrown from .NET 4.x DataSource API DocStream objects previously would fail the associated I/O operation after a retry; now any detected exceptions will immediately fail the document and report it through IIndexStatusHandler and WasDocError.
* Other bug fixes

## dtSearch 2022.01 (Build 8749) Released May 17, 2022

* **This version updates the zlib compression/decompression library code in dtSearch to the new zlib version 1.2.12 to remedy
  a reported memory corruption vulnerability in the zlib library.**
  For more information see [nvd.nist.gov](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-25032).* The zlib update affects the Windows, Linux and macOS versions of dtSearch products.* Zlib is a library of code that is used very widely in software products to implement ZIP-compatible compression and decompression.
      For more information about zlib, please see [zlib.net](https://zlib.net/).* dtSearch uses zlib for decompression of zip-compressed data in ZIP files and other formats such as
        PDF and Office that use zlib-compatible compression. dtSearch also uses zlib to compress documents and internally-generated
        data when caching text and documents in an index and when indexing PDF files.* Because the zlib vulnerability could affect
          dtSearch products if used to index maliciously-created content, this update is recommended for all users.

## dtSearch 2022.01 (Build 8748) Released May 2, 2022

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* Added new command-line options for dtSearch Desktop to simplify network deployment and suppress startup prompts:
  /agreetolicense (agree to license agreement), /dirstd (use standard data folder), /sn (specify serial number),
  and /noupd (suppress update checking).
* Fixed index creation failure when targeting a Samba network share due to delayed lock release.
* Reduced memory use when processing very large Excel pivot tables.
* File parser bug fixes affecting: PST, MSG, PDF, MP4
* Other bug fixes

## dtSearch 2021.02 (Build 8733) Released December 31, 2021

* Fixed: Clicking "Add Folder" in the 64-bit dtSearch Indexer closed the indexer on some machines.
  Based on analysis in the linked articles below, this appears to have been due to an interaction
  between a Windows 11 bug in shell32.dll and the Intel TBB memory manager,
  which the 64-bit dtSearch Indexer used. The error occurred consistently on Windows 11 machines with
  OneDrive configured to back up the Desktop folder, although other cases may exist as well.
  This issue may affect any Windows application that uses the Intel TBB
  memory manager (tbbmalloc.dll) or similar replacement allocator such as Microsoft's mimalloc.dll. Technical details on the issue are
  [here (github.com - Intel TBB project)](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB/issues/665) and
  [here (github.com - Microsoft mimalloc project)](https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc/issues/498)
* Fixed: Indexing error affecting the multithreaded indexing preview feature causing index updates to fail with a "203" error code.

## dtSearch 2021.02 (Build 8730) Released December 6, 2021

### All Products

* *Multithreaded Indexing Preview*
  Added support for building indexes using multiple threads,
  greatly improving indexing speed on 64-bit Windows systems with multiple cores. At least 16 Gb of memory is required.

  In dtSearch Desktop/Network, click Options > Preferences > Indexing Resources to enable this option.

  For information on using multithreaded indexing in the API,
  please see [Multithreaded Operations](https://support.dtsearch.com/faq/dts0233.htm).

  This is a preview feature and should not be used for production work until released.
* Added support for the Hancom Office HWPX file format
* Windows 11, Windows Server 2022, and .NET 6 added as supported platform/environments.

### dtSearch Desktop/Network

* *Index Groups*

  Index groups provide a way to organize your indexes in the Search dialog box to make very large numbers of indexes easier to manage.
  To
  enable this option, click Options > Preferences > Search Options, and check the box to "Show indexes by group".
  When groups are enabled, if an index name contains a colon, then the part before the colon is considered to be the group.
  For example, if an index is named "Business: Records", then the group is "Business".
  In the Search dialog box, "Records" would appear under a collapsible "Business" group heading.
* *"Find indexes"*

  The new "find indexes" control in the Search dialog box lets you filter the list of
  indexes by name and quickly select indexes to search using the keyboard.

  To enable it, click Options > Preferences > Search Options, and check the box to "Show index finder".

  To use "find indexes", in the Search dialog box press Ctrl+F and type any part of an index name. As you type
  the index list will update to only show matching index names. You can also use the \* and ? wildcard characters to find indexes using wildcard matches.

  Press Ctrl+Q to quickly check only the first listed index and return to the search request box, or press ENTER to just return to the search request box.
* Better handling of font scaling on systems with multiple monitors.
* Added sort direction arrows to the search results column headers.
* Added Ctrl+Q hotkey for checking/unchecking checkboxes to select items in search results.
* Added support for using 64-bit Adobe Acrobat/Adobe Reader to display PDF files. The [64-bit dtSearch PDF Search Highlighter plug-in](https://www.dtsearch.com/pdfhl) is also
  needed for hit-highlighting to work.
* The dtSearch Desktop/Network search shortcut now launches the dtSearch Desktop/Network version that corresponds to the Adobe Reader/Acrobat version installed, so if you have the 64-bit version
  of Adobe Acrobat or Adobe Reader, the shortcut will automatically launch the 64-bit version of dtSearch Desktop/Network.
* Added option in Options > Preferences > Indexing resources to "Store a copy of indexed Outlook items in the index". Checking this option eliminates the need to run
  the 32-bit version of dtSearch Desktop/Network if you are using the 32-bit version of Outlook and the 64-bit version of dtSearch Desktop/Network if you are using the 64-bit version of Outlook,
  because dtSearch can display retrieved Outlook items by extracting them from the index.

### dtSearch Engine

* Added M1 support to the macOS version of the dtSearch Engine.
* Added streaming interface to Java DataSource API to allow data source documents to be returned as objects.

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* Fixed bug causing "Search within these results" in dtSearch Desktop/Network to return an incorrect error message when searching just-created indexes.
* Fixed bug causing indexing crash due to low-level I/O error.
* File parser bug fixes affecting: XLSX, DOCX, PDF
* Other bug fixes

## dtSearch 2021.01 (Build 8712) Released June 23, 2021

### All Products

* Beginning with this version, the minimum supported Windows version for dtSearch Desktop
  is Windows 7, and the minimum supported Windows version for the dtSearch Engine is Windows Vista.
* dtSearch version numbers will now be based on the year released and an ordinal, so this version is 2021.01.
  This numbering change does not reflect any change in compatibility or index format.

  For developers using the API, the internal major version number returned by the API will remain "7".
  The minor version number will use two digits for the year and two digits for the ordinal,
  so the third version released in 2021 would have minor version number 2103.

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* Added support for extracting macro text from vbaProject.bin files
* File parser bug fixes affecting: PDF, DOCX
* Updated WebDemo sample .NET Core application for .NET Core 3.1/5.0
* Fixed bug affecting mailto: links extracted using API with the dtsoFfHtmlShowLinks flag
* Other bug fixes

## dtSearch 7.97 (Build 8684) October 14, 2020

### dtSearch Desktop

* Added option in dtSearch Desktop to automatically use the 64-bit indexer if possible for indexing.

  This option is in Options > Preferences > Indexing Resources and is enabled by default.

  When this box is checked, the 64-bit indexer will be used for any eligible index update, regardless of how it is started
  (scheduled, invoked using "Update Index", or invoked using "Update Multiple Indexes").
  Under 64-bit versions of Windows, all indexes can be built with the 64-bit indexer
  except indexes of Outlook messages when the Microsoft Office version installed is 32-bit.
  When multiple indexes are being updated in a scheduled task that updates several indexes, the 64-bit indexer
  will be used for all indexes that are 64-bit eligible, and the 32-bit indexer will be launched separately to update any
  indexes that must be run in 32-bit mode.
* Added an option in dtSearch Desktop to control whether dtSearch should check for sufficient disk space before
  starting an index update. If this box is checked, dtSearch will estimate the amount of disk space needed to build
  an index and will halt the update with an error message if insufficient space is available.
  This option is in Options > Preferences > Indexing Resources.

### dtSearch Engine

* The 64-bit Windows version of the engine supports options for using a replacement memory manager
  such as Intel's TBB library, which can improve performance in heavily-multithreaded applications.
  For more information on, please see this article:
  ["External allocator integration"](https://support.dtsearch.com/webhelp/dtSearchCppApi/External_allocator_integration.html)

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* Fixed bug affecting term weighting applied by field name
* File parser bug fixes affecting: XLS, XLSX, ZIP (malicious compressed content detection improved), DOCX
* Fixed date parsing bug affecting search requests containing two or more date ranges spanning different years expressed as text
* Fixed HTML hit highlighting error affecting unrecognized tag with no spaces around it* Fixed memory leak in .NET Core DataSource indexing API
  * Other bug fixes

## dtSearch 7.96 (Build 8668) March 30, 2020

* The 64-bit version of the dtSearch Engine now uses the [Microsoft Universal CRT](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/introducing-the-universal-crt/).
  The CRT is included with Windows 10 and is automatically installed by Windows Update on most other versions of Windows.
  It can be installed as described this Microsoft article: [The latest supported Visual C++ downloads.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads)* The 64-bit version of the dtSearch Engine supports Windows version Vista and later, so Windows XP is no longer supported.
  * The dtSearch PDF Search Highlighter plug-in has been updated for compatibility with the 2020 versions of Adobe Reader and Adobe Acrobat. The new
    [highlighter can be downloaded here.](https://www.dtsearch.com/pdfhl/)
  * Fixed bug in .NET Standard DataSource API affecting modification and creation dates of documents and the DocDisplayName property.* Fixed hit highlighting error affecting EML with embedded IMG tag.* Fixed bug affecting the "not w/n" operator, causing it to retrieve a document that should not
        have been retrieved.* File parser bug fixes affecting: XLS, DOC, DOCX, PDF
        * Other bug fixes

## dtSearch 7.95 (Build 8633) October 24, 2019

* Fixed: in the .NET and .NET Core API, IndexInfo.UserFields did not delimit fields
  and values clearly. A quote-delimited string is used now, with double quote
  characters in field values converted to single quote characters to prevent ambiguity.
* Fixed: Crash when the dtsConvertAutoUpdateSearch flag was used with dtsSearchWantHitsByWord in a field search.
* Fixed: bug affecting fuzzy search in combination with wildcard near front of word.
* Fixed: multicolor hit highlighting did not work with a search request that included
  a regular expression with the ( character as part of the regular expression pattern.
* Fixed: Encoding error processing long UTF-8 text file (in version 7.94 only)
* File parser bug fixes affecting: PDF, XLS, Unicode Filtering, MSG, CSV
* Other bug fixes

## dtSearch 7.94 (Build 8620) July 19, 2019

* Developer note: dtv\_pdfcrypto.dll (Windows) and dtv\_pdfcrypto.so (Linux) are now
  separate components again, as they were in versions 7.92 and earlier.
  (In version 7.93, the cryptographic capabilities of dtv\_pdfcrypto.dll and dtv\_pdfcrypto.so were merged into
  the dtSearch Engine, to provide a simplified, flat deployment option for developers. We are reversing this
  decision in version 7.94 because the new ViewerLibraries element in the homedir.xml file provides a
  more flexible way to get the
  same result while covering other external file parsers and also preserving a separate
  engine version limited to 40-bit RC4 encryption for developers.)
* Fixed in 7.94.8620: A bug in versions 7.93 and 7.94.8619
  caused errors in the target index for the merge
  when a newly-created index was merged with an index created
  by an earlier version. To determine if an index is affected by the bug, run Verify
  Index using version 7.94. Affected indexes will be reported as having a merge consistency error.
  Compressing the index with version 7.94 will repair the errors, and version 7.94 will
  also correct for the index errors when searching the index.
* In indexes created with the "Hyphens all three" option (dtsoHyphenAll), hyphens
  in search requests are now treated as spaces instead of
  significant by default, so a search for "one-two" will find "one two".
  To restore the previous treatment, there is a new option
  in dtSearch Desktop in Options > Preferences > Letters and Words.
  In the API, use the flag dtsSearchHyphenSignificant in SearchJob. This
  option does not affect indexing.
* Added new Options.CheckConfiguration API to validate that a
  dtSearch Engine application has been correctly deployed.
  CheckConfiguration checks for missing components such as the ICU library,
  CMAP files, alphabet file, stemming rules, etc.
  Use CheckConfigurationFlags to specify the items to check.
  In the C++ API, use dtssCheckConfiguration.
* Added an option to skip symbolic links during indexing. In dtSearch Desktop,
  this is in Options > Preferences > Filtering Options,
  and in the API use the flag dtsIndexSkipSymbolicLinks.* Added flag dtsoTfMimeFollowContentDispositionForText in Options.TextFlags to
    tell dtSearch to treat plain text or HTML in MIME messages as attachments
    rather than part of the message body if the message part has
    a Content-Disposition header specifying that the part is an attachment.
  * Fixed: dtSearch Desktop bug causing the list of indexes to be empty after an out-of-memory error
  * Fixed: SearchResults.SerializeAsXml did not preserve 32-bit Unicode characters.
  * Fixed: Hit highlighting error that resulted in an extra </div>
    tag to be generated in conversion output from some Office documents,
    resulting in formatting errors.
  * Fixed: Hit highlighting bugs affecting PDF, conversion to HTML, and SearchReportJob when using cached text
  * Fixed: Bug in encoding detection could cause a crash indexing or converting files with unknown encoding (plain text or HTML)* File parser bug fixes affecting .html, WMF and EMF images, Excel 2003 XML, XBase, Excel 95, PPT.
    * Other bug fixes

## dtSearch 7.93 (Build 8596) March 19, 2019

* Fixed: Intermittent crash when generating search reports (build 8596)
* Fixed bugs in the new ICU-based Unicode processing including word breaking error affecting Katakana Half-width characters U+FF60-FF9F, U+2103 degrees Celsius and U+2109 degrees Fahrenheit.
* Fixed: Crash indexing corrupt PowerPoint file due to read past end of buffer
* Fixed: Indexing bug affecting the new accent-optional index type with the "hyphen all three" option set.
* Fixed: 16-byte memory leak each time ICU-based automatic encoding detection is done
  for a file with ambiguous encoding information during indexing or file conversion, potentially causing out-of-memory
  errors indexing very large document collections with the 32-bit indexer
* Fixed: Error compiling dtSearchNetApi4 sample code
* Other bug fixes

## dtSearch 7.93 (Build 8592) February 25, 2019

### All Products

* This version adds *preliminary* support for the new PDF 2.0 file format. PDF 2.0 is the first major
  change in the PDF file format since PDF 1.0 in 1993. Support is "preliminary" because while there are some tools
  that can open PDF 2.0 files now, end-user commercial software products have not yet started to support generation of
  new PDF 2.0 output so there is almost no data available for testing.

  Because this new PDF version changes the header information, **dtSearch versions before 7.93 will not recognize the PDF 2.0 file format and will miss all content in these files**.
  Therefore, it is *essential* to use dtSearch 7.93 or later before attempting to index and search PDF 2.0 files.
* Added new "Accent-optional" index type.

  To create an accent-optional index in dtSearch Desktop/Network, click Index > Create Index (Advanced)
  and check the box to "Support optional accent sensitivity".

  When you select an accent-optional index
  for searching, the Search dialog box will show a new option, "Accents in search terms are significant".

  In an accent-optional index, accented letters can be made significant for
  matching purposes, but unaccented letters will still always match both
  accented and unaccented forms.

  For example, a search for "abc" in an accent-optional index find both "abc" and "Ã¤bc". The results will be the same whether or not you check the
  "Accents in search terms are significant" box.

  A search for "Ã¤bc" in an accent-optional index will find different results depending on whether the "Accents in search terms are significant"
  box is checked. If the box is checked, then "Ã¤bc" will match "Ã¤bc" and not "abc".
  If the box is not checked, then "Ã¤bc" will match both "Ã¤bc" and "abc".
* Added support for searching emoji characters in indexes
  created with version 7.93 and later.
* Microsoft has deprecated support
  for Windows XP compatiblity in Visual Studio. Because the Windows version of dtSearch is built with Visual Studio, this means that dtSearch support for
  Windows XP is now deprecated as well. (dtSearch is currently built using Visual Studio 2017 which still supports Windows XP.)

### Index Compatibility

* To enable new features in dtSearch 7.93, this version makes some changes in the index format.
  Older dtSearch versions will be able to search indexes created by dtSearch 7.93, but this is not recommended due to lack of support
  in older dtSearch versions for the new features added in version 7.93 such as Accent-optional indexes.
* If you use dtSearch to merge new indexes into older existing indexes:
  indexes created with dtSearch 7.93 will not be compatible with older indexes for purposes of merging indexes, unless you specify when you
  create the newer index that it must be compatible with the older index that will be included in or the target of the merge.
  To create an index that is compatible with an existing older index, use Create Index (Advanced),
  check the box to make the index compatible with an existing index, and select the index
  to use for compatibility.

  Using the API, set IndexJob.CreateCompatibleIndexPath to specify the index to use as the source for compatibility information.
  To preserve the compatibility of an existing index that is being updated with ActionCreate=true, set the flag
  dtsIndexCreatePreserveExistingSettings in IndexJob. (This is equivalent to setting IndexJob.CreateCompatibleIndexPath to IndexJob.IndexPath.)

### dtSearch Engine

* Added integration with the International Components for Unicode (ICU) providing improvements in
  text processing, such as the new accent-optional index type and support for emoji searching,
  for indexes created with version 7.93. Please see "ICU Integration"
  in the dtSearch Engine API Reference for more information. ICU integration is optional for applications using the developer API,
  and enabled by default in other products.

  Optional integration with ICU can be enabled using a new icuconfig.xml configuration file.
* To enable the new accent-optional index type (see above) set the flag
  dtsIndexCreateOptionalAccentSensitive in IndexingFlags.
  To require accents to match at search time, set the flag dtsSearchRequireAccents in SearchFlags.
  Note: ICU integration must be enabled to use the new accent-optional index type.
* A new IndexJob.CreateCompatibleIndexPath option lets you specify an existing index to use as a template when creating an index.
  The noise word list, alphabet, ICU character tables and other
  text processing rules such as dtsoTfAutoBreakCJK will be copied from the old index into the new index.
* The cryptographic capabilities of dtv\_pdfcrypto.dll (Windows) and dtv\_pdfcrypto.so (Linux) are now built
  into the dtSearch Engine itself. Previously the dtSearch Engine .dlls and .so files for Windows and Linux only supported decryption
  up to 40-bit RC4, and the dtv\_pdfcrypto.\* files were needed to enable decryption up to 256-bit AES. Please see "Export Notice" section of the
  ["Installing the dtSearch Engine"](http://support.dtsearch.com/webhelp/dtSearchCppApi/Installing_the_dtSearch_Engine.html) article in the dtSearch Engine API Reference
  for information on exporting the crypto-enabled dtSearch components.
* dtSearch Engine supports a new homedir.xml file that can be used to specify the location of data files and the viewers folder and to consolidate
  data files separately from executables. Previously the CMAP files were installed under the bin and bin64 folder
  and the WordNet files were installed in a top-level folder under the dtSearch Developer folder.
  Now these files can be installed along with other data files (alphabet, noise word lists, stemming rules)
  in a "data" folder parallel to the bin and bin64 folder.

  Use of homedir.xml is optional. Developers can still use the old deployment locations for data files.

### Fixes and other enhancements

* Fixed: dtSearch Desktop/Network, when saving search results as CSV, incorrectly quoted user-defined (stored field) field values containing quotation marks.
* Fixed: Extra whitespace appears in front of tables when viewing some retrieved HTML files in Internet Explorer and dtSearch Desktop.
* Fixed: In the .NET Core API for Linux, the array SearchResultsItem.Hits reported incorrect word offsets of hits.
  This did not affect hit highlighting
  if SearchResults.SetInputItem() was used because the correct hit offsets stored internally in SearchResults were used.
* Fixed: Intermittent crash indexing PDF file due to read past end of buffer
* Fixed: Incorrect indexing of hyphens in indexes created with dtsoHyphenAllThree ("all three ways") option and then updated with a different hyphenation option.
* Fixed: Sorting search results by title resulting in incorrect ordering for PDF files.
* Fixed: Indexing error affecting Outlook and Spider indexes in dtSearch Desktop (7.93 Build 8591 only)
* File parser bug fixes affecting \*.rtf, \*.msg, \*.pdf
* Other bug fixes

## dtSearch 7.92 (Build 8572) November 15, 2018

### All Products

* Added support for Hancom \*.hwp files. Support covers both the current \*.hwp format and the Hanword 97 format.

### Fixes and other enhancements

## dtSearch 7.91 (Build 8553) June 17, 2018

### dtSearch Engine

* Added faceted search and multicolor hit highlighting to the ASP.NET Core sample application.
* Added flag dtsoTfUseEmailDateAsFileDate in Options.TextFlags to use the internal message date (sent/received
  date) as the file date for standalone .msg and .eml files, for purposes of file date filtering and
  the date that appears in search results.
* .NET Standard API: fields in Options and SearchResultsItem changed to properties; additional optional
  parameters in SearchResults.UrlEncodeItemWithIndexId (applications will
  need to be recompiled but no source code changes needed).

### Fixes and other enhancements

* This version fixes a denial of service vulnerability affecting searches in dtSearch Web, and potentially other web-facing applications using the dtSearch Engine that accept very long search requests.
* Fixed: In dtSearch Desktop, Outlook error "8004010f = MAPI\_E\_NOT\_FOUND "The information store could not be opened." trying to view
  Outlook messages after a search."
* File parser bug fixes affecting: .html
* Other bug fixes.

## dtSearch 7.90 (Build 8538) April 12, 2018

### dtSearch Engine

* The dtSearch Engine has a new [.NET Standard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard)
  API similar to the current .NET API in dtSearchNetApi4.dll, but compatible with
  .NET Standard 2.0, .NET Core, and Xamarin. Supported platforms: Windows, UWP, Linux, macOS,
  Android (beta), and iOS (beta).

  As with the current .NET API, the .NET Standard API relies on a dtSearch Engine native library (dtSearchEngine.dll under Windows,
  libdtSearchEngine.so under Linux, etc.). Therefore, applications will need both the .NET Standard API wrapper,
  dtSearchNetStdApi.dll, and the native library for each platform.

  For more information on this new API, please see: [.NET Standard API Information](https://support.dtsearch.com/faq/dts0241.htm)
  and the
  [API documentation](http://support.dtsearch.com/webhelp/dtSearchNetStdApi).

  The current dtSearch Engine for Windows version includes the Windows and UWP versions of the .NET Standard API. The
  current dtSearch Engine for Linux version includes the Linux version of the NET Standard API. For other platforms, please
  [contact dtSearch](https://www.dtsearch.com/contact.html)
* Added new ASP.NET Core web search sample application, installed in the examples\NetStd\WebDemo folder.
* Added new flag in Options.FieldFlags, dtsoFfNormalizeEmailAddresses, to remove extra space and quotation marks
  from email address fields and move embedded comments to the end of the name or email address.
* Added new flag in Options.TextFlags, dtsoTfHtmlSkipNav, to skip indexing content inside <nav>...</nav> tags.
* Added new flag in Options.TextFlags, dtsoTfIgnoreNoIndex, to ignore <!--BeginNoIndex--> and <!--EndNoIndex--> tags in HTML.

### dtSearch Desktop

* To make it easier to review the results of large numbers of scheduled index updates, scheduled tasks now generate
  a summary report listing all of the indexes updated and the results for each.
  After a scheduled update, click the "Last Update" button in the "Schedule Updates" dialog box to see the summary report.
  The report will also contain links to the detailed index update reports
  for each index.

  These reports will be stored in the LOGS subfolder of your dtSearch data folder so you can also access them directly in this folder.

### Fixes and other enhancements

* Fixed: dtSearch Desktop Indexer reports index is is in use when started from dtSearch Desktop Search
* Fixed: C++ API crash in executing dtsSearchReportJob if pReportCallBack is zero
* File parser bug fixes affecting: .pdf, .wpd
* Fixed dialog box error in "Schedule Updates" in dtSearch Desktop indexer (build 8538)
* Other bug fixes.

## dtSearch 7.89 (Build 8517) November 20, 2017

### dtSearch Engine

* New flag dtsIndexTokenizeEnumerableFields in IndexJob.IndexingFlags to automatically tokenize multi-value enumerable fields using
  Options.StoredFieldDelimiterChar. For example, if a field value is "First!Second!Third" and StoredFieldDelimiterChar is !, then
  instead of one enumerable field containing "First!Second!Third", the document will be indexed with three separate enumerable field
  values, "First", "Second", and "Third".

### Fixes and other enhancements

* Fixed: dtSearch Desktop opens very slowly after the Windows 10 "Fall Creators Update" is installed, particularly
  after Windows has been running for a while without rebooting. The
  source of the problem appears to be how the Windows 10 "Fall Creators Update" implements the Win32 GetPixel API.
  The new version bypasses GetPixel to the extent possible, relying on other methods of obtaining pixel data.
* Fixed XML syntax errors converting database files (\*.dbf, \*.csv) to it\_ContentAsXml
* Fixed: Intermittent crash when closing dtSearch after doing a search that retrieves Outlook messages.
* File parser bug fixes affecting: .pdf, .msg
* Other bug fixes.

## dtSearch 7.88 (Build 8499) September 25, 2017

### dtSearch Engine

* New flag dtsoTfHideRevisions in Options.TextFlags to remove strikeout text and redlining from Microsoft Word documents edited using "Track Changes".
* it\_ContentAsXml output format now marks headers and footers in Office documents

### Fixes and other enhancements

* .NET API: Fixed bug in Server.SetEnginePath that could cause an ApiInitializer exception if the path passed to SetEnginePath contained Unicode characters.
* The rarely-used HTML header fields (HtmlTitle, HtmlH1, etc.) are now disabled by default. Set the flag dtsoFfHtmlIndexHeadersAsFields in Options.FieldFlags
  to enable them.
* File parser bug fixes affecting: .xlsb, .pdf
* Fixed spider bug due to invalid temp filename generated from page URL
* Other bug fixes.

## dtSearch 7.87 (Build 8481) July 1, 2017

### dtSearch Desktop/Network

* New indexing option: "Generate and index SHA-256 hashes for documents" in Options > Preferences > Indexing Options.
  Hashes are unique numerical codes that are sometimes used in forensics to identify files.
  dtSearch now has an option to generate an SHA-256 hash for each document as it is indexed and to append the hash to the indexed document text as a field named "Sha256Hash".
  The original document is not changed in any way; this just affects the index and provides another way to search.
  Generating hashes will make indexing slower.

### dtSearch Engine

* dtSearch Engine for macOS released, with APIs for C++ and Java. The API and indexes are compatible with the Windows, UWP, and Linux versions of the dtSearch Engine.
* New search option to use File Conditions to search by detected type id.
  Example: xfilter(type "excel") will limit a search to files created by Excel, regardless of filename or extension.

  Currently, developers have the option to add the optional File Type and File Type Id fields
  to documents during indexing by setting the dtsoFfIncludeFileTypeField and dtsoFfIncludeFileTypeIdField flags in Options.FieldFlags.
  When documents are indexed with these flags, field searches can be done on the file type like this:
  "File Type contains Excel", and after a search retrieved documents will appear with a "File Type" field at the end.

  The new "type" filter search works with any index created by dtSearch 7.87 or later and does not depend on any option settings.
  It does add any visible text to documents after a search, and can be efficiently combined with other file
  selection criteria (size, date, name, extension) using the File Conditions syntax.
* New flag in Options.FieldFlags: dtsoFfGenerateSha256Hash (see explanation under dtSearch Desktop above).
* Added C# sample code demonstrating how to index SharePoint data using the DataSource API.

### Fixes and other enhancements

* dtSearch Desktop: the option to display long files in report view will not apply to PDF files.
* dtSearch Desktop: after an index update, in addition to the HTML file listing documents that could not be indexed (Index\_LastUpdateErrors.htm),
  dtSearch Desktop will now also create plain-text files with simple lists of filenames to faciliate automated processing. The filename lists will be:
  IndexLog\_ImageOnlyPdf.txt, IndexLog\_Encrypted.txt, and IndexLog\_OtherErrors.txt.
* Added button in dtSearch Diagnostic Tools to delete all dtSearch-related temporary files.
* Mapitool name templates can use # instead of % to identify symbols (example: "##Subject## [##Ordinal##]") for easier use in DOS batch scripts. The old % syntax
  still works.
* Mapitool defaults to using a simple message ordinal (1, 2, 3, ...) instead of the message record key to generate a unique filename for each message,
  because record keys can be very long in newer versions of Outlook. The -t command-line switch can be used to override the default.
* File parser bug fixes affecting: .xls, .pdf, one, mp4, .pptx, .mdb
* Other bug fixes.

## dtSearch 7.86 (Build 8458) February 28, 2017

### dtSearch Desktop/Network

* New indexing option: "Index links in PDF files" in Options > Preferences > Indexing Options. If checked, dtSearch will index any links embedded in PDF files.
* New indexing option: "Generate and index MD5 hashes for documents" in Options > Preferences > Indexing Options.
  MD5 hashes are unique numerical codes that are sometimes used in forensics to identify files.
  dtSearch now has an option to generate an MD5 hash for each document as it is indexed and to append the hash to the indexed document text as a field named "MD5Hash".
  The original document is not changed in any way; this just affects the index and provides another way to search. Generating MD5 hashes will make indexing slower.
* Added option in Options > Preferences > Fonts and Colors to suppress use of color when highlighting hits.

### dtSearch Engine

* New flags in Options.FieldFlags: dtsoFfPdfShowLinks and dtsoFfGenerateMd5Hash (see explanation under dtSearch Desktop above).

### Fixes and other enhancements

* Fixed incorrect detection of associated PDF application in Windows running inside Parallels Desktop for Mac.
* File parser bug fixes affecting: .xlsx, .pdf, \*.wpd, \*.one, \*.pptx, \*.xlsx
* Other bug fixes.

## dtSearch 7.85 (Build 8438) December 7, 2016

### dtSearch Desktop/Network

* dtSearch Desktop/Network now offers the option to highlight each search term or phrase in a search request in a different color. To enable this option, and to change
  the colors used for highlighting, click Options > Preferences > Fonts and Color.
* Added option in Options > Preferences > Indexing Options to index databases as text. With this option selected, database files
  such as Microsoft Access (\*.mdb, \*.accdb) and CSV files are indexed without treating each row as a separate document, and without
  including field attributes. All of the text, including field names, remains searchable, but database content is combined into a single
  plain text document, which makes indexing and searching faster.
* Added option in Options > Preferences > Indexing Options to index XML files as text. With this option selected, XML files
  are indexed without including field attributes. All of the text, including field names, remains searchable, but XML content treated as
  plain text, which makes indexing and searching faster.
* Added checkbox in dtSearch Desktop to enable compatibility with Parallels Desktop for Mac.
  Parallels Desktop is a program that enables Windows to run on Mac computers.

  The option enables dtSearch to work around an issue in Parallels Desktop that causes
  Parallels to report the modification date of files located in Mac folders as January
  1, 1601. When this box is checked, dtSearch alters the indexing process to ensure
  that the correct dates are detected.

  The option is in Options > Preferences > Indexing Options.

### dtSearch Web/Publish

* dtSearch Web and dtSearch Publish now offer the option to highlight each search term or phrase in a search request in a different color.
  The colors used for highlighting are stored in the dtsearch\_options.html file in the HighlightColors section.
  To enable this option when generating a search form, click the Document Display Options tab in Form Builder and check the box
  to "Highlight hits using multiple colors."

  To modify an existing search form to use multiple colors, add these lines to the end of your dtsearch\_options.html file:
  ```

  <BR><HR><I>HighlightColors: </I>
  <!-- $Begin HighlightColors -->
  ffff00,a6f500,00ffe3,cbe3ff,c5c3fa,ffbcff,ff9999,fcbf29,d7d7d7,eaddc2
  <!-- $End -->

  <BR><HR><I>Highlight hits using multiple colors: </I>
  <!-- $Begin MultiColorHighlighting -->
  1
  <!-- $End -->

  ```

### dtSearch Engine

* New UWP versions of the dtSearch Engine are included with this version.
  The UWP version of the C# API is implemented in dtSearchUwpApi.dll, and the C++ API is implemented in
  dtSearchEngine\_uwp\_Win32.dll and dtSearchEngine\_uwp\_x64.dll.

  For sample code, please the sample application in C:\Program Files\dtSearch Developer\examples\cs4\UwpDemo.

  The UWP API is identical to the .NET API with a few exceptions, which are described in a the file "dtSearch Engine for UWP.docx" in the UwpDemo folder.
* Added flags dtsoTfXmlAsText and dtsoTfDatabasesAsText to Options.TextFlags, corresponding to the two new options in dtSearch Desktop described above
  to index XML files as plain text and to index databases as plain text.
* Two enhancements to the implementation of multicolor hit highlighting in the developer API:

  (1) First, a new flag dtsSearchWantHitsByWordOrdinals has been added to the SearchFlags enumeration, and this flag should
  be used along with dtsSearchWantHitsByWord and dtsSearchWantHitsArray. With this flag set, each word or phrase in the HitsByWord report for a document will be preceded by an ordinal that constently identifies that word or phrase from among the words or phrases in the search request. This makes it possible for dtSearch to ensure that the mapping between search terms and highlighting attributes is consistent for all documents retrieved in a search, regardless of which terms were retrieved in each individual document.

  (2) Second, use of multiple highlighting attributes, enabled by the flag dtsConvertMultiHighlight, can now be combined with the dtsConvertUpdateSearch flag, which updates hit offsets for a retrieved document to reflect any changes either in the dtSearch version or the document since the document was indexed.

### Fixes and other enhancements

* Added dtsExoUseSimpleFilenames flag to ExtractionOptions to limit extracted attachment filenames to 64 characters, Ascii-only.
* Added support for EMF Spool (\*.SPL) files
* Added support for \*.PPT and \*.XLS files encrypted with 40-bit RC4 encryption to prevent modification, as long as a password is not needed to open the file.
* Improved handling of malformed dates in EML and MBOX messages.
* File parser bug fixes affecting: .docx, .pdf, .xls, \*.ppt, \*.EMF, OpenOffice
* Fixed automatic date recognition bug affecting date ranges.
* Other bug fixes.

## dtSearch 7.84 (Build 8405) August 31, 2016

### dtSearch Engine

* Compatibility note: dtSearchNetApi4.dll is now built with Visual Studio 2015 Update 3, so the CRT and MFC redistributables installers (VC\_redist\*.exe)
  for Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 should be used when deploying dtSearchNetApi4.dll.
  These installers are available here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53840.

### Fixes and minor enhancements

  in these files is still indexed. This change only affects reporting in the index update log.)
* Improved 32-bit indexing performance in low-memory conditions.
* Fixed indexing crash in mso20win32client.dll in the latest update to Office 2016 when indexing Outlook messages.
* Added API to change the score of a document in the dtsnSearchFound notification (C++) or ISearchStatusHandler.OnFound callback (.NET).
  In the C++ API, return dtsChangedItemScore from the dtsnSearchFound notification and set dtsSearchResultsItem.score to the new value.
  In the .NET 4.0 API, in ISearchStatusHandler.OnFound, set SearchResultsItem.Score to the new value and set SearchResultsItem.ChangedItemScore to true.
* File parser bug fixes affecting: .pdf, .rtf, .emf, .doc, .xls, .ppt, .pst
* Fixed bug in build 7.84.8404 causing the ' (apostrophe) character to appear incorrectly in conversion output in Internet Explorer 8.

### All products

* Added support for indexing PDF files with 128-bit RC4, 128-bit AES, and 256-bit AES encryption, as long as the file
  does not require a password to open and does not have the "copy text" permission disabled. Developer note: This is implemented in a new component, dtv\_pdfCrypto.dll, that
  is subject to export restrictions. Please see the license.htm file accompanying this version for more information. For details on
  the effect of encryption and permission settings on indexing, searching, and text extraction, please see <http://support.dtsearch.com/faq/dts0161.htm>.

  is located on a network share.
* Fixed extra "PBrush" and "Adobe Photoshop Image" captions in some Word documents with embedded images.
* In the Linux version, the dtSearch Engine library (.so) files are installed in the dtsearch/bin and dtsearch/bin64 folders instead of
  the lib and lib64 folders.
* Added RAR file parser (dtv\_rar.so) to the Linux version of the dtSearch Engine
* Fixed incorrect parsing of some .docx, .xlsx, and .pptx documents when document has missing or incorrect

## dtSearch 7.73 Build 8138 Released September 30, 2013

### All products

* Support for some older Windows versions is discontinued in dtSearch 7.73. Supported: Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2003 SP 2, Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows XP SP 3.
  Not supported: Windows 2000, Windows ME, Windows 98, Windows 95, and Windows XP versions without SP 3.

  This change is a result of our transition to Visual Studio 2012, using the v110\_xp platform toolset, to build all Windows products.
  The older .NET API wrappers (dtSearchNetApi2.dll and dtSearchNetApi3.dll) are still built using older compilers for compatibility.

### dtSearch Web/Publish

* Added detection of Windows PE and NE executables and Linux ELF executables (these formats are still indexed according to the
  binary files setting, with content either filtered or skipped)
* Fixed bug causing use of dtsExoDoNotConvertAttachments in FileConverter.ExtractionOptions to generate an incorrect "File Encrypted" error for
  some documents during file conversion (not indexing or searching).
* Fixed bug causing email headers to be indexed even if dtsoSkipEmailHeaders flag is set if filetype.xml set up to index message bodies separately from attachments.
* Added support for metadata extraction from HDPhoto images.
* Fixed bug causing extra whitespace to be generated in conversion to plain text (UTF-8) format.
* Mapitool.exe utility uses message delivered date property instead of modified date property to set the file date for extracted message items.
* dtSearch Developer installer updated May 18, 2013 to add missing MemAllocator.h header file.
* Fixed bug affecting nested proximity searches where a matching set of the terms exists exactly once and
  are preceeded (by the exact proximity range) by two or more instances of the proximity terms that
  do not satisfy the proximity criteria.
* Other bug fixes.

## dtSearch 7.71 Build 8080 Released November 30, 2012

### dtSearch Engine

* New support for highlighting hits using different colors for each search term when highlighting hits
  using FileConverter.
  For API documentation on this feature, please see the article "Highlighting each term using different attributes"
  in dtSearchApiRef.chm. Multicolor hit highlighting is not supported for PDF files displayed in Adobe Reader.

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* Added "Find Indexes" button in dtSearch Desktop's Index Library Manager to locate all indexes
  in a folder tree.
* Fixed CSV file parser bug that caused "duplicate field id" error during index merge.
* In dtSearch Web Setup, improved detection and reporting of IIS configuration problems such as missing IIS components
* File parser bug fixes affecting MSG, WordPerfect 4.2, PPTX, XBase, PPT, XLSB
* In Language Analyzer API, dtsLaJob.indexRetrievedFrom and dtsLaJob.alphabetLocation were not set during
  searches
* PDF hit highlighting support added for Adobe Reader XI
* Other bug fixes.

## dtSearch 7.70 Build 8063 Released September 28, 2012

### dtSearch Desktop

* New support for displaying images embedded in Office documents (DOC, DOCX, PPT, PPTX, XLS, XLSX, RTF, EML). To
  enable display of images in dtSearch Desktop, click Options > Preferences > Document display, and check the box
  to "Display images in documents".
* Added new options in dtSearch Desktop to (1) hide MIME headers in emails, (2) show properties of images embedded in documents,
  and (3) control whether paths are indexed
  along with filenames when the "Index filenames as text" options is enabled. These options are in the Options > Preferences > Indexing Options
  dialog box.

### dtSearch Engine

* Embedded attachments, objects and images in documents can be extracted using dtsExtractionOptions (C++) or
  ExtractionOptions (Java and .NET), which
  specify output locations and rules for filename generation. Currently the following are supported:

  Attachments in EML, MSG, DBX, TNEF (winmail.dat), PDF, MDB and ACCDB (Access);

  objects in DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, PPT, PPTX, RTF;

  images in DOC, DOCX, PPT, PPTX, XLS, XLSX, RTF, EML, MDB and ACCDB (Access).
* New single-document option for indexing Access (\*.mdb, \*.accdb), XBase (\*.dbf), and Comma-separated values (\*.csv) files.

  By default, dtSearch indexes each record of database files (\*.mdb, \*.accdb, \*.csv, \*.dbf) as a separate document.
  This new option provides a way to index all records in a database file as a single document.
  For more information, see dtSearchApiRef.chm (Overviews > Databases and Fields > Database files (\*.mdb, \*.dbf, \*.csv))
* Added dtsoFfShowImageProperties flag in Options.FieldFlags to display image properties (such as EXIF data) for images embedded in documents. Image properties
  are always indexed for images in seperate files. This flag only affects images embedded in documents, such as a .jpg embedded in a Word file.
  A related change, made for consistency, affects the hanlding of image files embedded in .eml email files. Previously these properties
  were always extracted. Now they will only be extracted with the dtsoFfShowImageProperties flag is set, so .eml files will be handled
  consistently with other file formats.

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* Eliminated use of FILE\_FLAG\_RANDOM\_ACCESS, which could cause excessive memory consumption under Windows Server 2008 because of what appears to be a
  bug in Windows caching behavior http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2549369 for
  more information).
* Zlib version updated to 1.2.7
* dtSearch.Spider2.dll and dtSearch.Spider4.dll have new dependencies on zlib DLLs zlib\_wapidll\_{VC8/VC10}\_{32/64}.dll to handle
  gzipped sitemap.xml files.
* Added file parsers for Ichitaro word processor versions 5 and later.
* File parser bug fixes affecting
  MSG,
  PDF,
  DOCX,
  PPTX,
  Excel 2,
  RTF
* Message attachments to MIME emails are now indexed as attachments (so they can be handled consistently with other attachments
  in the new attachment-related features described above) rather than being merged with the text of the message.
* Added reporting of PDF files that do not contain any page text. In dtSearch Desktop, these will appear in the
  index log with "Image Only" after the type name (click **View Log** in the Update Index dialog box to see the
  log of indexed files). In the API, the flag fiImageOnly will be set in IndexFileInfo (.NET, Java) or
  dtsIndexProgressInfo.fileInfoFlags (C++) during indexing.
* Removed extra path information from headers in containers converted to text using FileConverter.exe or
  FileConvertJob with the dtsConvertInlineContainer flag
* Removed "Document Properties" caption from Word, PowerPoint, and Excel 2003 file properties. For applications
  that require this flag for backward compatibility, use the new flag dtsoFfIncludeDocumentPropertiesCaption in Options.FieldFlags
* Added new values to SearchReportJob.Header and SearchReportTemplate.rtf: %%Ordinal%%, %%DocId%%, %%Type%%
* Added new dtsConvertIncludeBOM flag to FileConverter.Flags to add UTF-8 BOM to UTF-8 output
* FileConverter with dtsConvertJustDetectType produces more specific type ids for image, music, and video files instead of it\_Media
* Fixed search/highlighting error affecting the pre/N and w/N operators
* Added new dtsnIndexFolderInaccessible callback notification in IndexJob, logging in indexlog.dat, and logging in HTML
  index log of inaccessible folders during indexing
* Fixed incorrect time zone adjustment of PDF built-in creation and modification date fields
* Fixed too-long filenames generated for items extracted from PST files (names could be too long for some file systems when copied using Edit > Copy File in
  dtSearch Desktop)
* Other bug fixes.

## dtSearch 7.68 (Build 8025) December 5, 2011

### All products

* Outlook and MIME email files have a new, simplified header that will be consistent between the two formats
  with these fields: From, SentVia (for emails sent using a mailbox other than the "From" address), To, CC, BCC, Subject, Date.

  The footer for these formats will include these additional fields for backward-compatibility:
  Sender (combines From and SentVia); Recipient (combines To, CC, and BCC); SentDate (msg files only); DeliveredDate (msg files only).

  The Sender and Recipients fields provide a way to search across all senders or all recipients of a
  message. These fields will also allow searches using the field names used in older versions, such as "Sender contains example", to
  continue to work.

  Documents indexed with dtSearch versions 7.67 and earlier will be displayed with the old header so the change will
  not cause hit highlighting problems with previously-indexed emails.

### dtSearch Engine

* Includes new (August 9, 2011) security updates from Microsoft Bulletin MS11-025.
  For more information on this Microsoft security update, including updated dependencies for
  dtSearch Engine developer components, [please see this article](http://support.dtsearch.com/dts0227.htm).
* Added dtsoFfIndexArchiveFileLists flag.
  This option adds a searchable file named ArchiveFileList.html to
  ZIP and RAR archives during indexing. The original file is not modified
  but the ArchiveFileList.html file is searchable as if it were part
  of the ZIP or RAR file. The file consists of a list of the names
  of the files inside the archive.

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* File parser bug fixes affecting
  XLSX (string values computed by formulas),
  PST (crash indexing damaged PST archive),
  MSG,
  DOC (list style formatting, table of contents formatting),
  XyWrite
* Updated Options > Preferences dialog box in dtSearch Desktop and
  fixed accessibility issues affecting dtSearch Desktop Search and Indexer.
* Other bug fixes.

## dtSearch 7.67 (Build 7973) June 1, 2011

### All products

* Includes security updates from Microsoft Bulletin MS11-025.
  For more information on this Microsoft security update, including updated dependencies for
  dtSearch Engine developer components, [please see this article](http://support.dtsearch.com/dts0227.htm).
* Added support for indexing PST files directly. Because Outlook locks the PST file that is currently in use, this will not work
  with the PST file that you are actively using in Outlook, and is primarily for use
  in situations where archived or forensically-obtained PST files are being searched.
* Added plug-in for Adobe Reader X to enable hit highlighting in PDF files retrieved after a search. For more information please see:

  [dtSearch PDF Highlighter Plug-in Documentation](http://www.dtsearch.com/pdfhl/PdfHighlighter.pdf) (PDF)

### dtSearch Desktop

* Added support for highlighting hits in PDF files in Adobe Reader X and Adobe Acrobat X.
* As a result of the [Microsoft MFC MS11-025 update](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2011/ms11-025),
  dtSearch Desktop 7.67 requires Windows XP or or newer and will not run under Windows 2000.

### dtSearch Engine

* .NET API: Added DataSource.DocStream to allow a document to be passed through the DataSource API as a stream
* .NET API: Added sample code demonstrating indexing of Azure blob data (examples\cs4\AzureBlobDemo)

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* Fixed hit navigation error in the 64-bit version of dtSearch Desktop
* Fixed file parser bug causing extra spaces to appear in XPS documents
* Fixed bug causing incorrect hit highlighting in documents indexed using the binary filtering algorithm
* Added detection of MIDI files
* File parser bug fixes affecting
  PPTX,
  XyWrite,
  tag font size in XML output,
  AVI file detection,
  WordPerfect (text using WP character set 12),
  WordPerfect 5 (soft hyphens),
  WordPerfect 4.2 (error in automatic file type detection),
  ZIP (filename filters were not applied to exclude ZIP contents in an unindexed search),
  Word for DOS (incorrect parsing of a character code)
* Other bug fixes.

## dtSearch 7.66 (Build 7936) January 25, 2011

### dtSearch Engine

* Added .NET 4.0 versions of the .NET API (dtSearchNetApi4.dll, dtSearch.Spider4.dll) and sample code
  for C# .NET 4.0 and VB.NET 4.0
* Added dtsSearchFastSearchFilterOnly search flag to enable much faster, optimized generation of a SearchFilter from
  a search when no other output is required from the search.
* Added WordListBuilder.GetLastError to the C++, Java, and .NET APIs to provide better reporting of errors
  resulting from WordListBuilder calls.
* Added new flag to enable caching of field values in WordListBuilder to make ListFieldValues calls faster.
  The flag is dtsWordListEnableFieldValuesCache (in the WordListBuilderFlags enumeration) and is passed to WordListBuilder
  using the new SetFlags method.
* Added new .NET method Server.SetEnginePath to allow ASP.NET application deployment without administrative
  access
* Added new .NET sample application, AzureDemo, demonstrating use of the dtSearch Engine in an Azure instance.
  For documentation explaining how to deploy in Azure, see:

  Overviews > Installing the dtSearch Engine > Deployment steps: Azure 64-bit (in dtSearchApiRef.chm).
* Added a way to disable file parsers using the file type table (filetype.xml) by setting the TypeId to the
  id of the parser to disable and the Flags value to 2.
* Added a mechanism for a dtsInputStream to simulate an I/O error by returning a negative value from read() of less than
  10,000. When this occurs, dtSearch will interpret it as an I/O error and halt processing of the current input
  file immediately, reporting an I/O error through the API.

### All Products

* Faster indexing of binary data using the [filtering algorithm](http://support.dtsearch.com/webhelp/dtSearchCppApi/frames.html?frmname=topic&frmfile=Filtering_Options.html)

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* In dtSearch Desktop, added SizeK, IndexRetrievedFrom, SearchDate, ReportDate variables to
  SearchReportTemplate.rtf and SearchListTemplate.rtf
* Java and .NET API: Fixed IIndexStatusHandler bug causing PercentDone to remain zero during compression
  of an index
* Added docId of document being removed from an index to IndexFileInfo reporting through IIndexStatusHandler
* Fixed FileConverter bug that caused invalid XML to be generated from some conversions
  due to output of character code 128.
* Added SearchJob.UnindexedSearchFlags in the .NET API and SearchJob.setUnindexedSearchFlags in the Java API to enable
  case and accent-sensitive unindexed searches in these APIs
* Added .NET SearchFilter.GetItems() to provide access to an array of the doc ids selected in a SearchFilter
* File parser bug fixes affecting
  Office XML drawings embedded in Word, PowerPoint, and Excel files;
  interpretation of OEM character codes (\_x00NN\_) in Excel 2007 files;
  dates prior to 1970 in MDB files;
  performance and memory use parsing MIME files;
  Word auto-numbering;
  PDF
* Other bug fixes.

## dtSearch 7.65 (Build 7907) September 14, 2010

### Fixes and minor enhancements

  before adding documents" box is checked in the Update Index dialog box
* Fixed file parser bug affecting indexing of QuickBooks backup (\*.qbb) files

## dtSearch 7.65 (Build 7906) August 20, 2010

### dtSearch Engine

* Added dtsoFfSkipEmailHeaders flag for Options.FieldFlags to suppress searching and display of headers in MIME and Outlook messages

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* Reduced memory requirements for parsing very large XLS files
* Fixed bug that allowed XML output from saved search results and XML generated by conversion to
  it\_ContentAsXml to contain the colon (":") character in tag names, which caused the generated XML
  to fail validation.
* Fixed PDF hit highlighting error affecting documents using ActualText parameter.
* Automatic date recognition has been changed to limit the scope of automatically recognized entities
  so they will not cross a field boundary.
* Fixed error in HTML conversion causing some output to fail to word-wrap when displayed in a browser.
* Fixed memory leak in searches that use the dtsSearchLanguageAnalyzerSynonyms flag.
* ZIP file parser applies default encoding in filetype.xml when interpreting ambiguous ZIP

* Reduced memory use when merging very large indexes
* Fixed PDF hit highlighting errors in certain types of corrupt PDF files
* Other bug fixes.

## dtSearch 7.64 (Build 7876) March 15, 2010

### dtSearch Engine

* Added dtsSearchLanguageAnalyzerSynonyms flag to enable using a language analyzer to generate morphological variations on a
  search term at search time. When this flag is set, the language analyzer is called for each word or phrase in the search request.
  The flag dtsLaInputIsSearchTerm is passed to the language analyzer in dtsLaJob.flags, so the language analyzer knows why it is being called.
* Added dtssGetWordBreaker API function to provide direct access to the dtSearch Engine's internal word breaker using the
  language analyzer API. For sample code demonstrating how to use this API, see the WordBreak example in examples\vc8\WordBreak.
* Added more structural information to the output generated by conversion to the it\_ContentAsXml file format.
* Added to COM interface: WordListBuilder.ListFieldValues, WordListBuilder.SetFilter, and IndexJob.EnumerableFields.
* Added dtsListIndexSkipNoiseWords flag for ListIndexJob to list words in an index without including any noise words.
* Added dtsoFfSkipDataSourceFields flag for Options.FieldFlags to prevent DocFields values from appearing in
  FileConverter output

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* Fixed incorrect display of CreationDate and ModDate properties in PDF files
* Fixed incorrect hit highlighting when Unicode Filtering options at search time different from options
  used to index a file. To ensure consistent options, Unicode Filtering options are stored in the index
  when the index is created, in the index\_a.ix file.
* Fixed error updating index when directory specified for temporary files is inaccessible.
* Fixed index merge bug causing "Inconsistent doc ids from target index" error during merge.
* Fixed two search report bugs causing incorrect hit highlighting.

  Microsoft Word versions and adding type detection for additional file formats
* Added support for text extraction from Adobe Framemaker MIF, XFA form templates in PDF files, and Visio XML files
* Fixed "Excessive nesting" error indexing OpenOffice document due to bug parsing table structure
* Fixed RTF file parser bug affecting handling of the \upr tag
* Other file parser bug fixes affecting Multimate, Lotus 1-2-3, PDF, Word, PowerPoint
* Other bug fixes.

### Fixes

* Fixed problem running dtSearch.exe on some systems after installing the kb973923 patch from Windows Update.
* Fixed missing checkboxes in dtWebSetup64.exe under Windows Server 2008

### Compatibility notes for developers working with the .NET 2.0 API only

* In dtSearch 7.63, the
  DLL dependencies for dtSearchNetApi2.dll have changed due to the release of the Visual Studio .NET
  2005 Service Pack 1 Security Update for ATL.   Because dtSearchNetApi2.dll is built with
  the updated version of Visual Studio .NET 2005, it requires the updated MFC and CRT DLLs that are included with
  that version.

  This issue does not affect any other dtSearch Engine API.
* This Microsoft redistributable program will install the required components:

* dtSearch.exe: Added support in Edit > Copy File for copying container files other than archives

## dtSearch 7.54 (Build 7680) September 5, 2008

### All products

* New Microsoft Access file parser added with no dependencies on the Microsoft JET Engine or ODBC drivers,
  so it works identically under Windows and Linux. This file parser supports Access databases created
  by Microsoft Access 95 through Access 2007.
* New file parser added for Flash (\*.swf) files.

### dtSearch Engine

* Added support for searching for Unicode characters that are not defined as letters by default (such as currency symbols)

  By default, all Unicode characters that are defined as letters in the Unicode specification are searchable. To make other characters such as Unicode currency characters searchable, you can add a line to the end of the alphabet file listing the Unicode characters to make searchable. Example:
  ```
  AdditionalLetters = 00a2 00a3 00a4 00a5 20a0 20a1 20a2 20a3 20a4 20a5 20a6 20a7 20a8 20a9 20aa 20ab 20ac

  ```
  This example makes all of the Unicode currency characters such as the Euro, Pound, and Lira searchable characters.
* Added ListIndexFlags.dtsListIndexIncludeDocInfoAsXml flag to list all documents in an index in XML
  format including document properties and stored fields. The ListIndex.exe utility also has a new dx option
  to do this for an index from the command-line.

### dtSearch Publish

* Added option to enable links to Office documents (doc, xls, etc.) to launch in Office, outside
  of the lbview.exe program. The setting is "ExternalLaunchExtensions" in the lbview.ini file.
* See below for important information about Adobe Reader and Adobe Acrobat 9 compatibility

### Adobe Reader and Adobe Acrobat 9 Compatibility

* Adobe Reader and Adobe Acrobat 9 have a new setting that disables hit highlighting
  in PDF files by default. To change this setting in Adobe Reader or Adobe Acrobat 9,
  click Edit > Preferences > Search, and check the box to "Enable search highlights
  from external highlight server".
* dtSearch Desktop 7.54 will automatically make this change when it detects that
  hit highlighting is disabled (after asking permission). dtSearch Desktop 7.54
  also fixes a problem that causes PDF files to open very slowly in dtSearch with Adobe Reader or
  Adobe Acrobat 9 installed.
* dtSearch Publish 7.54 has new settings in the lbview.ini file to automatically enable
  PDF hit highlighting when it is disabled (after asking permission).
* dtSearch Web cannot change this setting in client applications, so web sites that
  rely on Adobe Reader to highlight hits in PDF files should notify users of the
  need to change this setting to preserve hit highlighting.

### Fixes and minor enhancements

### dtSearch Engine

* 64-bit Java API
* 64-bit version of the dtSearch Engine for Linux
* Option to [index .eml files as containers](http://support.dtsearch.com/faq/dts0219.htm) (so the message body and attachments are each indexed as a separate file).
* Sample ASP.NET application implementing an OpenSearch interface to the dtSearch Engine

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* dten600.dll: To improve consistency in the handling of punctuation in field names, unsearchable characters
  are now removed from field names in input data, with a few exceptions (:&\_+=.) to minimize the effect on backward
  compatibility. In previous versions this was done in indivdual file parsers so the effect of punctuation in
  field names depended on the format of the input data.
  This change will not generally affect searching because only searchable letters are used when
  matching field names.
  This change may affect the field names associated with [stored fields](http://support.dtsearch.com/faq/dts0109.htm),
  in cases where the field name contains punctuation characters.
* dten600.dll: Fixed two bugs affecting field parsing in Office 2007 documents.
* dten600.dll: Fixed incorrect document count displayed in history.ix when startingDocId set to value other than 1
* dten600.dll: Fixed XML hit highlighting bug resulting in illegal &nbsp; entity appearing in XML output
* dten600.dll: Fixed bug causing extra "F" character to appear in stored fields
* dten600.dll: Improved handling of low-memory conditions for searches that generate very large search results sets
* dten600.dll: Fixed error caching text in index when an external language analyzer returns overlapping blocks of text
* Added: FileConvert.exe and ListIndex.exe command-line utilities utilities
* dtSearch.Spider2.dll: Added LinkTraceFilename option to create a log of the links followed and not followed during a crawl
* Added dtsLaJob.searchRequestPunct string advising external language analyzers of the search request punctuation
  characters to preserve when analyzing a search request
* dtSearchNetApi2.dll: If data source throws an exception, IndexJob will catch it and report the exception through
  the Errors object
* dtSearchNetApi2.dll: Added FileInfoFlags.fiOpenFailed to indicate when a document returned from a DataSource
  with the DocIsFile flag set to true cannot be opened because it is either not present or locked
* dten600.dll: Fixed merge bug affecting merges of indexes containing the same container file with the newer version of the
  container file in the target index

## dtSearch 7.51 (Build 7556) January 18, 2008

### dtSearch Desktop

* Search results saved as XML include the selection state of the items in the search results list (i.e., checked or unchecked). Search results
  saved in other formats such as CSV can either include all items or just selected items.

### dtSearch Web

* Added 64-bit version of dtSearch Web and dtSearch Web Setup

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* dtSearch.Spider2.dll: Added 64-bit version of the .NET Spider API

## dtSearch 7.50b (Build 7518) November 25, 2007

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* dten600.dll: Fixed SearchReportJob error causing more blocks of context than specified by MaxContextBlocks to be included
  in the generated report.
* lbvprot.dll: Fixed error starting CGI applications

## dtSearch 7.50 (Build 7517) November 9, 2007

### Enhancements (All products)

* Improved integration with external language analyzers: (1) Language analyzers will be given much larger chunks
  of text to analyze, which enables some language analyzers to operate more effectively.
  (2) Language analyzers will be given consistently-sized
  chunks of text whether indexing or highlighting hits, which ensures that hit highlighting will not be affected by
  changes in the behavior of a language analyzer depending on the size of the data it receives.

### dtSearch Desktop

* In the **Edit > Copy File** dialog box, added option to preserve original modification,
  creation, and last access times of the original files
* In the **Edit > Copy File** dialog box, added option to copy the entire container file
  when a matching document is inside a container (such as a ZIP file or email archive)
* Option in **Options > Preferences > Indexing Options > Letters and Words** to automatically
  insert a word break around Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters in text. This makes it possible
  for documents that do not contain word breaks to be searched.

  \*.wmf) and Enhanced Metafile (\*.emf) formats

### Enhancements (dtSearch Engine)

* Added flags to control recognition of ambiguous dates (new TextFlags values dtsoTfRecognizeDatesPresumeDMY, dtsoTfRecognizeDatesPresumeYMD)

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* dtSearchNetApi2.dll: JobErrorInfo no longer requires or supports the IDisposable interface.
* dten600.dll: Filenames longer than 1024 characters could cause "duplicate filename" errors when verifying an index.
* dtSearchw.exe: Fixed problem with mouse wheel scrolling in search results window with high-resolution mouse wheels
* dten600.dll: Improved recognition of CJK encodings in HTML and PDF
* dten600.dll: Fixed error in title attribute for documents indexed using the COM implementation of
  the data source API
* dten600.dll: Changed the behavior when a container document such as a ZIP file is removed from an index using its doc id
  (using IndexJob.ActionRemoveListed). Instead of just removing the container, the container and all contained items will be removed.
* dten600.dll: MS Word file parser displayed some internal field data (TC, TA, SEQ)
* dten600.dll: Added detection of .docx, .xlsx, .xps, and OpenOffice documents with

## dtSearch 7.41 (Build 7420) April 21, 2007

### Enhancements (dtSearch Engine)

* Added support for automatically varying hit weights according to the field they occur in, through the new
  SearchJob.FieldWeights setting. For more information, see the "Relevance" topic in the dtSearch Engine API Reference.
* Added improved progress reporting during unindexed searches to the C++ API (see dtsSearchProgressInfo in the dtSearch Engine API Reference)
  and the .NET 2.0 API (see ISearchStatusHandler2 in the .NET 2.0 API Reference).
* Compatibility note for developers working with the .NET 2.0 API *only*:  The
  DLL dependencies for dtSearchNetApi2.dll have changed due to Visual Studio .NET
  2005 Service Pack 1.   Because dtSearchNetApi2.dll is built with
  Service Pack 1, it requires the updated MFC and CRT DLLs that are included with
  that version.  Executing the vcredist\_x86.exe included with Visual Studio
  .NET 2005 Service Pack 1 (dated December 2, 2006 or later) will install these
  components.

  This issue does not affect any other dtSearch Engine API.

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* dten600.dll: New fields added as properties of .eml files - CC, BCC, and Attachments (a list of the filenames of all
  attachments).
* dtSearch .exe and .msi files digitally signed for better operation in Windows Vista
* dtSearchNetApi2.dll: Error in ConvertPath caused unnecessary refresh of virtual path mappings from the metabase.
* dten600.dll: Minor improvements in the binary file detection and Unicode filtering algorithm for binary files
* dten600.dll: Fixed bug in MHT file parser that caused hit highlighter to generate blank HTML page for some MHT files
* dten600.dll: IndexCache object added to the COM interface.
* dtSearchw.exe: Fixed error starting indexer and dtSearch Web Setup under Windows Vista

## dtSearch 7.40 (Build 7360) February 22, 2007

### Enhancements (All products)

* Added automatic recognition of dates, email addresses, and credit card numbers in text. For more information,
  see http://www.dtsearch.com/dateRecog.html>
* Added support for Vista (XMP) metadata in .jpg and .tif images.
* Added support for PowerPoint 2007 (\*.pptx).
* Added support for Vista XML Paper Specification (\*.xps) documents.

### Enhancements (dtSearch Engine)

* Added IndexCache object in the .NET 2.0 API, and dtsIndexCache object in the C++ API, to enable much faster searching
  when a series of searches must be done against a small number of indexes. The IndexCache maintains a thread-safe pool of open
  indexes that are available for searching during the lifetime of the cache. Using the cache eliminates the need to open and close
  the index for each search

### Enhancements (dtSearch Desktop)

* Added option in **Options > Preferences > Spider Options** to log the links found in each page the Spider follows.
* Added option in **Options > Preferences > Search Options** to change the maximum number of words a search request
  can match.

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* dtSearch.exe: Fixed "Invalid Character" error displaying documents in report view after installing Internet Explorer 7.
* dten600.dll: When serializing stored fields to XML, add a \_ in front of any stored field names that begin with a digit
  so the resulting XML remains syntactically correct.
* dten600.dll: In the C++ API, the pOnIndexWordFn callback was called with encoded field information in addition to the text of the word,
  and if the called function did not preserve this field information intact, field attributes could become invalid. To prevent this, in
  version 7.40 the field information is removed before the callback so pOnIndexWordFn will not see or be able to affect field attributes.
* dten600.dll: Increased the maximum value for MaxWordsToRetrieve to 512k (from 256k)
* dten600.dll: When checking for available disk space in a folder, indexer did not check whether the folder
  was mounted from a different physical drive.
* dtSearch Web: Added option to log BooleanConditions and FileConditions to search log.
* dtindexerw.exe: Fixed MAPI\_E\_UNKNOWN\_FLAGS error indexing Outlook messages in Outlook 2002 (fixed in build 7360)

## dtSearch 7.30 (Build 7320) September 30, 2006

### Enhancements (All products)

* Added preliminary support for Word 2007 (\*.docx) and Excel 2007 (\*.xlsx) based on the current
  Office 2007 beta and available documentation.
* Added support for JPG and TIFF metadata, including EXIF and IPTC fields.
* Unicode filtering file parser can handle individual documents larger than 2 Gb, and support for files
  larger than 2 Gb added to the extext.exe utility
* Improved handling of partially inaccessible email files. In previous versions, if an email
  had encrypted or corrupt data (for example, an encrypted attachment), the whole email was
  reported as encrypted or corrupt. In this version, the readable portion of the message
  is indexed and the unreadable portion is separately reported as a partially encrypted or
  partially unreadable file. This change applies to Outlook messages, TNEF files, .eml files,
  MBOX archives, and .msg files.

### Enhancements (dtSearch Engine)

* Beta x64 (64-bit) versions of the dtSearch Indexer and dtSearch Engine (dtIndexer64.exe, dtengine64.dll, and
  dtSearchNetApi2.dll. The index format and APIs (C++, COM, and .NET) are identical to the 32-bit version.
  The 64-bit components are in a separate download file (dtSearch64\_730.exe) with the same installation password
  as the dtSearch Engine SDK.
* Added alternative PDF highlighting mechanism for client-based applications (see "Highlighting Hits in PDF files" in the API
  Overviews section for details)
* Added ListIndexJob object to the .NET 2.0 API to list files, words, or fields in an index (see
  dtSearchNetApi2.chm for API reference)
* Added dtsListIndexIncludeDocId flag for dtsListIndexJob and ListIndexJob to provide a quick way to
  list all documents in an index and the doc id for each document
* C++ API Changes to support 64-bit file sizes in dtsInputStream (added size64 and seek64), dtsInputStreamReader,
  dtsFileInfo (added size64), dtsSearchResultsItem (added size64). These changes preserve binary compatibility for
  the dtSearch Engine DLL, but some C++ code may trigger new warnings when compiled because of 64-bit values returned.
* Added dtsIndexKeepExistingDocIds flag to specify that, when compressing an index, the indexer should not remap document ids,
  so document ids will be unmodified in the index once compression is done.

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* dtWebSetup.exe: Fixed bug causing "Build Search Form" tool to create extra button bar when overwriting an existing form
* dten600.dll: Fixed 'out of memory' error verifying very large index
* lbviewer.exe: Fixed bug causing XML to appear incorrectly when displayed using a stylesheet
* dten600.dll: PowerPoint file parser - added support for embedded OLE objects
* dten600.dll: PDF file parser detects and handles case where text in right-to-left languages (Hebrew or Arabic) is
  stored backwards (left-to-right) in a PDF file, and automatically inverts the characters in the word so it will be correctly searchable
* dten600.dll: PDF file parser handles invalid PDF files created by OCR product that leaves out required /Pages and /Page tags in PDF structure
* dtSearchNetApi2.dll: JobErrorInfo object did not implement IDisposable interface, preventing deterministic release of allocated resources.

## dtSearch 7.25 (Build 7285) June 25, 2006

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* dtWebSetup.exe: Fixed bug causing dtSearch Web Setup to fail to run on some Windows 2003 Server systems
* dten600.dll: Added Fragmentation, ObsoleteCount, and IndexFlags to the COM IndexJob.GetIndexInfo() and Java
  IndexJob.getIndexInfo() methods. Also, indexing dates are now reported as a date and time.

* Added support for indexing and searching TNEF (Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format) files
* dtSearch.Spider .NET API has new Authentication, FormAuthentication, and ProxyInfo properties

### Fixes and minor enhancements

* dten600.dll: EML parser - fixed bug indexing messages with no message body
* dten600.dll: Excel file parsing bug caused indexer to hang on corrupt Excel file
* mapitool.exe: Added workaround for MAPI error MAPI\_E\_NOT\_ENOUGH\_MEMORY when saving a
  message that has a very large number of recipients (see
  http://support.microsoft.com/kb/171907).
* dten600.dll: RTF parser - fixed bug parsing headers in RTF files
* dten600.dll: Improved parsing of Ole10Native streams in OLE Storage files
* C++ Source code samples reorganized into vc6, vc7, and vc8 folders
* dten600.dll: Fixed PDF hit-highlighting bug that caused highlighting to fail to appear in some documents

## dtSearch 7.23 (Build 7241) May 8, 2006

  memory allocated for SearchResults

### Fixes

* dten600.dll: PowerPoint file parsing bug caused incorrect character formatting
* dten600.dll: Word file parsing bug caused right-to-left text to be left-aligned instead of right-aligned by default.
* dten600.dll: EML parser - improved detection and parsing of malformed .eml files.
* mapitool.exe: Fixed error converting UTC date when saving .msg files to disk
* dten600.dll: Fixed crash indexing corrupt .mp3 file
* libdten600.so (Linux): Fixed error parsing zipped files with accented characters in the filename
* dtsearch.exe: Fixed error detecting Ctrl+C keyboard shortcut
* dten600.dll: Excel file parser bug caused some valid XLS files to be incorrectly reported as corrupt

## dtSearch 7.22 (Build 7217) March 14, 2006

### Enhancements (dtSearch Engine)

* .NET 2.0 API for Visual Studio .NET 2005. The .NET 2.0 API wrapper is dtSearchNetApi2.dll, and the .NET 2.0 version of the Spider API is dtSearch.Spider2.dll.
  The API is identical to the .NET 1.1 API. For sample code, see the examples\cs2 and examples\vb.net2 folders.
* Added dtsSortByFullName sort flag
* Added docByteRead64, bytesRead64, bytesToIndex64 to dtsIndexProgressInfo
* Added Options.StoredFieldDelimiterChar, which provides a way to specify a delimiter between multiple instances of
  a stored field in a single document

### Enhancements (dtSearch Desktop)

* Added option to dtSearch to view PDF files as plain text instead of using Adobe Reader (Options > Preferences > External Viewers).

### Fixes

* dten600.dll: Fixed indexer bug that caused index to be reported as having "Illegal ref ptr" error when verified
* dten600.dll: Fixed Excel file parser bugs affecting formatting of date and time values
* dten600.dll: Fixed indexing crash when indexing very large .gz files
* dten600.dll: Minor improvements to word break detection in PDF files
* dten600.dll: Fixed RTF file parser bug that could cause indexing crash on corrupt RTF file
* dten600.dll: Excel file parser defaults to 10 digits of precision for numbers without a
  specified format (consistent with
  Excel).
* dten600.dll: Minor improvements to Unicode filtering algorithm.

## dtSearch 7.21 (Build 7164) January 23, 2006

### Enhancements (All products)

* IFilter support to enable
  dtSearch to parse document types such as Microsoft OneNote and AutoCAD that
  include IFilters.

  IFilters are components that enable various Microsoft search products, such as Microsoft
  Index Server, to extract text from documents. For example, when you install Microsoft
  OneNote, an IFilter is installed to enable searching of \*.one files. To tell dtSearch
  to use installed IFilters to process some of your files, set up a rule in Options > Preferences > File Types and
  under File type, select "IFilter". In dtSearch Engine applications, use the FileTypeTableFile to specify the filename
  patterns to use with IFilters. The IFilter adapter only works on systems with the Microsoft component query.dll installed.

  For information on products that include query.dll, see
  http://support.microsoft.com/dllhelp

### Fixes

* dten600.dll: Fixed bug that prevented some items in ZIP files from being displayed after a search (an "unable to access
  input file" message would appear instead).
* dten600.dll: Fixed bug in file parsers for Microsoft Office documents (PowerPoint, Excel,
  and Word) that could cause dtSearch to crash attempting to index corrupt documents
* dten600.dll: Fixed bug in PDF file parser that caused "Bad xref" error on some PDF files created with
  PDF 1.5-only compatibility
* dtsearch.h: unnamed unions removed from the dtsMessage structure. This will not affect binary compatibility
  but may require source code changes in C++ code that accessed undocumented union members. Because the removed
  union members were undocumented, this change should affect very few programs.

## dtSearch 7.20 (Build 7136) December 6, 2005

### Enhancements (All products)

* New file parsers for OpenOffice documents, spreadsheets, and presentations (\*.sxw, \*.sxc, \*.odt, \*.ods, etc.),
  covering OpenOffice version 1 and OpenOffice version 2 (the "Open Document Format for Office Applications")
* New file parsers for the Microsoft Office XML formats (Microsoft Word 2003 XML and Microsoft Excel 2003 XML)

### Enhancements (dtSearch Desktop)

* Added "Opening containing folder" in right-click menu for retrieved items
* Improved reporting of errors that occur when copying files in Edit > Copy File(s)
* dtindexer.exe: added /caf and /cat command-line option to cache text (/cat) or cache original files (/cad), when creating indexes using
  the command line, and /recog to recognize an index.
* Added **Help > Check For Updates** feature to automatically download new
  versions

### Enhancements (dtSearch Engine)

* dtSearch.Spider.dll component provides a .NET API for the dtSearch Spider. For API documentation, see dtSearchNetApi.chm.
  For sample code, see C:\Program Files\dtSearch Developer\examples\cs\SpiderDemo.
* New xfilter search type, "ext", to search only on the filename extension (dot required). Examples:
  `xfilter(ext ".doc")` matches file with a .doc extension; `xfilter(ext "~.doc")` matches file without a .doc extension;
  `xfilter(ext ".")` matches file with no extension. This search feature will only work with documents that were indexed with
  dtSearch 7.2 or later.
* SearchReport supports %%FirstHit%% macro in ContextHeader to indicate the word offset of the first hit in the context block
* dtsIndexCacheTextWithoutFields flag added to IndexingFlags. This flag makes it possible to cache text (for generation of
  a synopsis to include in search results) without including any of the fields added using the data source API.
* dtsErAccCachedDoc flag added to ErrorCodes. This error code indicates that a document could not be extracted from
  the document cache in an index (this usually means that the index was created without caching enabled)
* dtsConvertJustDetectType flag added to ConvertFlags, to have FileConverter or DFileConvertJob just detect the file format of
  a document. The format is returned in FileConverter.DetectedTypeId.
* dtSearch Engine for Linux updated to the dtSearch 7.2 code base; multithreading support added
* dtsReportIncludeFileStart flag added to ReportFlags. This flag causes a block of text from the beginning of the
  document to be included in the generated search report.
* A new search feature makes it possible to restrict a search to the text of documents (excluding any metadata). To search for text that is not
  in any field, search for //text contains (search request). Example: `(//text contains apple) and (author contains smith)`

### Fixes

* DynaZip unzip component (dunzip32.dll) updated to new version that eliminates buffer overrun vulnerability in earlier versions.
* dtSearch.exe: Installing Adobe Acrobat 7.05 update caused hit highlighting to stop working in PDF files
* dten600.dll: Reduced amount of memory needed to parse very large Word, Excel, and Outlook items
* dten600.dll: Fixed file parsing error in Word documents that caused bullets to be rendered as auto-numbered lists
* dten600.dll: Changed handling of CSV files that do not have a header that lists field names; these files are now handled
  as plain text, since no field information is available for them.
* Spider: Fixed: Links with // in the name (http://www.example.com//default.html) caused index to be reported as corrupt by Verify Index
* dtSearch.exe: MAPI profile id, entry id, and store id were displayed in search results list
* dtSearch Web: WebSearchForm.js incorrectly handled blank filename filter
* Spider:  Did not match port number against filename filters for
  port numbers other than 80
* dtSearch.exe:  Displayed MAPI entry id and store id of Outlook
  messages in search results.

## dtSearch 7.10 (Build 7045) August 8, 2005

### Enhancements (dtSearch Engine)

* Added two new ASP.NET samples, one in VB.NET and one in C#, that demonstrate a search interface
  using a grid control for search results. The new samples are installed to C:\Program Files\dtSearch Developer\examples\asp.net.
  Please see the readme file in the project folders before trying to open them in Visual Studio -- a virtual directory mapping
  for C:\Program Files\dtSearch Developer\examples\asp.net has to be created first or Visual Studio will not be able to open
  the project.
* GetNthWordDocCount added to WordListBuilder to get the number of documents a word occurs in
* SearchReportJob enhancements: Added ContextSeparator; itUnformattedHTML output format, for easier generation of
  a synopsis; faster generation of search report when search results cover multiple indexes; dtsReportLimitContiguousContext flag
  to prevent very large synopsis when there are many hits close together.
* In the OnFound callback notification in the C++ and .NET interfaces, an application can veto individual items
  to prevent them from being included in search results. See SearchResultsItem.VetoThisItem (.NET) and
  DSearchJob::VetoThisItem (C++ Support Classes).* dtSearchNetApi.dll uses registry type library information and delay loading
    to eliminate the need for dten600.dll to reside on the system PATH in ASP.NET
    applications.* New TextFlags option to suppress automatic generation of
      xfirstword and xlastword (dtsoTfSkipXFirstAndLast)* Options.MaxFieldNesting setting to limit the permissible depth of field nesting
      * .NET API objects implement Dispose() for more deterministic release of allocated resources.
      * .NET IndexJob.ExecuteInThread and SearchJob.ExecuteInThread use .NET thread
        pool instead of creating a thread.
