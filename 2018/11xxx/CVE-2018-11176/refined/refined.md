```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before using it in OS commands, leading to command injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command [CWE-78]",
    "Execution with Unnecessary Privileges [CWE-250]"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution with root privileges, potentially leading to complete system compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP requests to the application's JSON-RPC API. Many methods are vulnerable, accepting attacker-controlled parameters that get passed to OS commands without proper sanitization.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
        "For unauthenticated command injection on login: Network access to the vulnerable application.",
        "For authenticated command injection vulnerabilities:  Valid authentication token acquired from successful login.",
        "For privilege escalation: An initial foothold (command execution as the web server user)."
