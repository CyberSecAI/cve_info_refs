The provided content relates to CVE-2018-11074.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue present in the embedded MadCap Flare Help files within RSA Authentication Manager.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The application is susceptible to DOM-based XSS, where malicious code can be injected through the browser DOM. This occurs because the application doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied inputs that are then used in the DOM.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A remote, unauthenticated attacker could trick a victim into supplying malicious HTML or JavaScript code to the browser's DOM, which then executes in the context of the vulnerable web application. This could potentially allow the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the victim user or steal sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a malicious link or crafted input provided by the attacker, which targets the vulnerable application. The attacker would need to trick a victim application user into accessing or triggering the malicious code within the vulnerable help files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the application. The attacker needs to trick a user into supplying malicious input, which is then executed in their browser when the vulnerable help files are accessed.
