Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-11047:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Cloud Foundry User Account and Authentication (UAA) service incorrectly authorized requests to administrative endpoints. It accepted a refresh token in place of an access token.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Authorization:** The UAA failed to properly differentiate between refresh and access tokens when authenticating requests to admin endpoints.
- **Token Confusion:** Refresh tokens, designed to have a longer lifespan than access tokens, could be used to gain unauthorized extended access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Extended Access:** An attacker with a valid refresh token could gain unauthorized access to UAA administrative endpoints for a longer period than intended.
- **Unauthorized Admin Actions:** The attacker could perform administrative actions (e.g., managing users, groups) within the UAA.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker who obtains a valid refresh token from a compromised user or system.
- The attacker then presents this refresh token as an access token to administrative endpoints of the UAA.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a valid refresh token.
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable UAA instance.

**Affected Versions**
The following versions of UAA and uaa-release were vulnerable:
- uaa versions: 4.19 prior to 4.19.2, 4.12 prior to 4.12.4, 4.10 prior to 4.10.2, 4.7 prior to 4.7.6, 4.5 prior to 4.5.7
- uaa-release versions: v60 prior to v60.2, v57 prior to v57.4, v55 prior to v55.2, v52 prior to v52.10, v45 prior to v45.11

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability was fixed in the following versions:
- uaa versions: 4.19.2, 4.12.4, 4.10.2, 4.7.6, 4.5.7
- uaa-release versions: v60.2, v57.4, v55.2, v52.10, v45.11
Users were advised to update to one of the above mentioned fixed versions to resolve the vulnerability.
