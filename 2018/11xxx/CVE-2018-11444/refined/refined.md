Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-11444:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw present in the `jobcard-ongoing.php` page of the EasyService Billing 1.0 application. Specifically, the `q` parameter in the URL is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input in the `q` parameter before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Boolean-based Blind SQL Injection:** It's possible to infer information by observing the response based on true/false conditions injected into SQL statements.
- **Error-Based SQL Injection:**  It's possible to trigger SQL errors that reveal information about the database structure or data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially extract sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials, customer data, financial records, etc.
- **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially modify or delete data in the database, leading to data corruption or loss.
- **Complete System Compromise:** In some cases, successful SQL injection can be leveraged to gain further control over the system running the vulnerable application, possibly resulting in remote code execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Requests:** The attacker manipulates the `q` parameter within the URL of the `jobcard-ongoing.php` page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Basic SQL knowledge:** An attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL syntax to craft the injection payloads.
