- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The web application of the Moxa OnCell G3100-HSPA Series uses a weak cookie parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure cookie management allows for brute-forcing of authentication parameters. The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-287 (Improper Authentication).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can bypass authentication, gain access to the web interface, and use all its functions, with the exception of changing the password. This gives the attacker full control over the device.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is remote, meaning that an attacker can exploit the vulnerability over a network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No specific attacker capabilities or position is mentioned other than the ability to perform brute-force attacks and network access to the vulnerable device.
