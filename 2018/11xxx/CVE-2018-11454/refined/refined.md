- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper file permissions in the default installation of TIA Portal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An attacker with local file system access can manipulate resources.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Manipulated resources can be transferred to devices and executed there by a different user, leading to code execution on the target device.
- **Attack vectors**: Local file system access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires local file system access to the TIA Portal installation. The victim needs to transfer the manipulated files to a device. No special privileges are needed.
