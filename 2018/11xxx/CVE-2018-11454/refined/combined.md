SUMMARY

The latest updates for SIMATIC STEP 7 (TIA Portal) and SIMATIC WinCC (TIA Portal) ﬁx two vulnerabilities.
These two vulnerabilities could either allow an attacker with local ﬁle write access to manipulate ﬁles and
cause a Denial-of-service-condition, or execute code both on the manipulated installation and on devices
that are conﬁgured using the manipulated installation.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict operating system access to authorized personnel.

• Validate GSD ﬁles for legitimacy and process GSD ﬁles only from trusted sources.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The Totally Integrated Automation Portal (TIA Portal) is a PC software that provides unrestricted access
to the complete range of Siemens digitalized automation services, from digital planning and integrated
engineering to transparent operation.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.0
(CVSS v3.0) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-11453

Improper ﬁle permissions in the default installation of TIA Portal may allow an attacker with local ﬁle
system access to insert specially crafted ﬁles which may prevent TIA Portal startup (Denial-of-Service)
or lead to local code execution. No special privileges are required, but the victim needs to attempt to
start TIA Portal after the manipulation.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-11454

Improper ﬁle permissions in the default installation of TIA Portal may allow an attacker with local ﬁle
system access to manipulate ressources which may be transferred to devices and executed there by
a different user. No special privileges are required, but the victim needs to transfer the manipulated
ﬁles to a device. Execution is caused on the target device rather than on the PG device.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.
