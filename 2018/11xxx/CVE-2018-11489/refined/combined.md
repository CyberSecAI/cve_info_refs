## Description

[![@Xin-Jiang](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21192841?v=4&size=48)](/Xin-Jiang)[Xin-Jiang](https://github.com/Xin-Jiang)opened [on May 24, 2018](https://github.com/pts/sam2p/issues/37#issue-325940727)

Here is the bug:

1248 else {

1249 /\* Its a code to needed to be traced: trace the linked list */

1250 /* until the prefix is a pixel, while pushing the suffix */

1251 /* pixels on our stack. If we done, pop the stack in reverse */

1252 /* (thats what stack is good for!) order to output. \*/

1253 if (Prefix[CrntCode] == NO\_SUCH\_CODE) {

in line 1253 , CrntCode should be checked cause Prefix is a array which has LZ\_MAX\_CODE (4096) size:

unsigned int Prefix[LZ\_MAX\_CODE+1];

The crash appears as follows:

(gdb) run crash000002 1.pdf

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
