    "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Redis, the worst of which may allow execution of arbitrary code.",

    "affected_versions": "< 4.0.14",

    ],
       "additional_details": "The vulnerability is present in the Lua struct library, which is not part of Lua itself but embedded in Redis. The vulnerability is triggered via the 'c' format specifier combined with a size of 0, then exploiting an integer overflow when calculating the size of the string to read. The affected function is b_unpack()."
