The provided content is related to CVE-2018-11407.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a result of missing a check for a `null` password when authenticating with an LDAP server. This is a continuation of a previous similar issue (CVE-2016-2403) where an empty password was not handled properly.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability lies in the Symfony LDAP component not properly handling null passwords during authentication with an LDAP server. Specifically, if the application is configured to authenticate against an LDAP server, and an empty password is used for authentication, the system will allow unauthorized access if the LDAP server is misconfigured.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could gain unauthorized access to an LDAP server if the application uses a vulnerable version of the Symfony LDAP component and the LDAP server is misconfigured.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the application's authentication mechanism that utilizes the vulnerable Symfony LDAP component. The attacker would attempt to authenticate with an empty password to the misconfigured LDAP server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to trigger the authentication process in the application that uses the vulnerable Symfony LDAP component. The attacker also needs to be aware of the application's use of an LDAP server and the server's misconfiguration. They need to provide an empty password as part of the authentication process.
