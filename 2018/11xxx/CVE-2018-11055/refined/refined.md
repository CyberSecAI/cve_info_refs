Response:
```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is a buffer over-read that occurs when parsing ASN.1 data.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
The vulnerability is related to a buffer over-read.

Impact of exploitation:
A remote attacker could use maliciously constructed ASN.1 data that would result in a buffer over-read, potentially causing a Denial of Service.

Attack vectors:
The attack vector is through a remote attacker exploiting the processing of malformed ASN.1 data.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be remote and send malformed ASN.1 data.
