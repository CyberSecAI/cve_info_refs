  "CVE-2018-11361": {
    "description": "In Wireshark 2.6.0, the IEEE 802.11 protocol dissector could crash. This was addressed in epan/crypt/dot11decrypt.c by avoiding a buffer overflow during FTE processing in Dot11DecryptTDLSDeriveKey.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the IEEE 802.11 dissector when processing FTE data during key derivation. Specifically, the Dot11DecryptTDLSDeriveKey function did not properly validate buffer lengths.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer Overflow",
         "Improper bounds checking"
      ],
      "impact": "A malformed packet can cause Wireshark to crash, potentially leading to a denial-of-service.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network injection of malformed packets",
         "Convincing a user to open a malicious pcap file"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can inject a crafted IEEE 802.11 packet on the network or convince someone to open a malicious packet capture (pcap) file.",
      "more_info": "The vulnerability is located in the `epan/crypt/dot11decrypt.c` file within the `Dot11DecryptTDLSDeriveKey` function. The issue was discovered by the OSS-Fuzz project. The fix involves preventing a buffer overflow by ensuring proper offset and length validation during FTE processing."
