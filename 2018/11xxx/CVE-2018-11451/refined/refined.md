Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-11451:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the affected devices process specially crafted packets sent to TCP port 102.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of network packets leads to a denial-of-service condition.
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending multiple specially crafted packets to port 102/tcp.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service condition, causing the EN100 module to become unresponsive.
- A manual restart of the affected device/module is required to restore functionality.
- This impacts the network functionality of the device, compromising system availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack vector.
- The attacker sends malicious packets over the network to the affected device or module.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the affected devices/modules.
- The attacker must be able to send multiple packets to the target on port 102/tcp.
- The IEC 61850-MMS communication needs to be activated on the affected device/module.
- No user interaction or privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory also mentions CVE-2018-11452, which is a related vulnerability but occurs when oscillographs are running.
- The advisory provides details on affected products and versions, along with remediation steps (firmware updates).
- Workarounds, such as blocking port 102/tcp, are also suggested.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Victor Nikitin, Vladislav Suchkov, and Ilya Karpov from ScadaX through coordinated disclosure.
