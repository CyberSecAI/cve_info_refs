Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A negative integer is passed as the size parameter (`length`) to the `memcpy()` function within the `Lizard_decompress_LIZv1` function in `lib/lizard_decompress_liz.h`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Integer Overflow/Underflow:** The `length` parameter, intended to specify the number of bytes to copy, can be manipulated to become negative. Since `memcpy()` treats the `length` argument as an unsigned `size_t`, the negative value wraps around to a very large positive number due to integer representation in memory which leads to reading out of bounds.
- **Memory Corruption:** Passing a large, wrapped positive integer value to `memcpy()` results in copying data beyond the intended destination buffer, causing memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Memory Read/Write:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to read and potentially overwrite arbitrary memory locations by controlling the size of the `memcpy()`.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** If the memory overwrite operation triggers a page fault, it could crash the application resulting in a DoS.
- **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** With precise control over the memory corruption, an attacker may be able to manipulate program execution flow, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Input File:** The vulnerability can be triggered by supplying a specially crafted compressed file to the `lizard_decompress_LIZv1` function via the `LizardIO_decompressSrcFile` entry point using command line parameters to `lizard_afl` or `lizard` tools.
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious input file which manipulates `length` within `Lizard_decompress_LIZv1`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply input to the lizard decompressor. No authentication is required and no other special position is needed to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to understand the format of the compressed file enough to manipulate length and trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided AddressSanitizer (ASAN) output clearly demonstrates the negative-size-param error during a `memcpy()` operation.
- The provided crash reports, with different sizes, show the attacker's ability to control the size argument of the `memcpy()`, leading to exploitable memory corruption scenarios.
- The vulnerability is in a compression/decompression library, it may be used across many applications.
