## Description

[![@glen-mac](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6212082?u=ae1726d00faf792bf891208a200b44d7a7158558&v=4&size=48)](/glen-mac)[glen-mac](https://github.com/glen-mac)opened [on May 3, 2018](https://github.com/inikep/lizard/issues/16#issue-319768110)

Hey there,

I have come across a vulnerability in the lizard decompressor, whereby a negative size integer is passed to `memcpy()`. This occurs in [lib/lizard\_decompress\_liz.h:207](https://github.com/inikep/lizard/blob/18ef22ddf50b6efbf982a88ce37357a38e6f4beb/lib/lizard_decompress_liz.h#L207).

```
memcpy(op, ctx->literalsPtr, length);

```

Since `memcpy()` takes the `length` and treats it as a `size_t`, this results in an excessive copy from `ctx->literalsPtr` into `op`.

```
void *memcpy(void *dest, const void *src, size_t n);

```

This was found while fuzzing commit [6a1ed71](https://github.com/inikep/lizard/commit/6a1ed71450148c8aed57de3179b1bdd81800bada) (current latest as of this date).

By controlling the number of bytes passed as `length`, this results in memory corruption which can lead to execution control.

Find the POC file here: [poc.zip](https://github.com/inikep/lizard/files/1969425/poc.zip).

As follows is the ASAN output:

```

SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: negative-size-param (/root/lizard/lizard_afl+0x4ae273) in __asan_memcpy
==26522==ABORTING

```

In the example above, with a memcpy size of -8, this value is interpreted as an unsigned integer and the memcpy continues until there is a page fault due to unmapped memory and the process terminates:

```
root at s127422 in ~/lizard (lizard●●)
$ ./lizard -d crash.file /dev/null
[1]    17128 segmentation fault  ./lizard -d crash.file /dev/null

```

To demonstrate that the memcpy size value can be controlled by an attacker, I have attached a series of crashes that result from a differing memcpy size value.
