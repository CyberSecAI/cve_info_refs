The provided content relates to CVE-2018-11380.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the `parse_import_ptr` function within the Mach-O parser of radare2.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap out-of-bounds read: The `parse_import_ptr` function attempts to read memory beyond the allocated buffer. Specifically, the code iterates using `indidx` to access elements in the `bin->indirectsyms` array. However, it doesn't properly check if `indidx` is within the bounds of the array before accessing `bin->indirectsyms[indidx]`. If `indidx` is out of bounds, it leads to a heap out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability could lead to a crash of the radare2 application due to the out-of-bounds memory access.
- In some cases, it could leak sensitive information from the process memory.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when parsing a specially crafted Mach-O file.
- Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered in the `parse_import_ptr` when it tries to locate an import via the indirect symbol table.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted Mach-O file to a user running radare2.
- The attacker doesn't need a privileged position, as the vulnerability is triggered by simply processing the malicious Mach-O file.
