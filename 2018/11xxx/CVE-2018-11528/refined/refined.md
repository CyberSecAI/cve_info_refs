Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the direct inclusion of the user-supplied `$code` parameter into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the SQL injection vulnerability in the `/api/sms_check.php` file. The `$code` parameter, obtained from the `$_GET['param']`, is directly used in the `get_one()` method.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code attempts to sanitize the input using `strip_tags`, but this is insufficient to prevent SQL injection. The `strip_tags()` function only removes HTML and PHP tags but doesn't prevent injection of malicious SQL syntax.
- **Vulnerable `get_one` Method:** The description also notes that the `get_one` function (likely a custom database interaction function) does not properly handle SQL injection and that the developer was aware that it contains filtering that is insufficient to prevent SQL injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Database compromise:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive data, modification or deletion of data, or even complete compromise of the database.
- **Information Disclosure:** In the provided proof-of-concept (POC), the attacker uses the SQL function `user()` to extract database user information. This is a common SQL injection technique to check if the injection is successful and gather more information about the system
- **Potential for further attacks:** With control over the SQL queries, the attacker can potentially gain full access to the server or other resources, depending on the permissions of the database user.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted GET request to `/api/sms_check.php` with the vulnerable parameter `param`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** An attacker only needs network access to the web application to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Understanding of SQL injection:** The attacker must have knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft the malicious payload.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided POC `api/sms_check.php?param=1%27and extractvalue(1,concat(0x7e,user()))%23` shows an example of how the SQL injection is performed. This payload uses the `extractvalue` SQL function in combination with `concat` to extract the database user. The `%27` is the URL encoded single quote, and `%23` is the URL encoded hash character, starting an SQL comment and preventing any subsequent SQL code to be run.
- The `strip_tags` function is used as an attempt of input validation but proves insufficient for preventing SQL injection.
- The vulnerability is present in the `sms_check.php` file.
- This exploit works in WuzhiCMS v4.1.0 and that the "official website" has been "reproduced successfully" by the person who submitted the bug report.
