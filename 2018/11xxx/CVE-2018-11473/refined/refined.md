Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization within the registration form of Monstra CMS 3.0.4.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The registration form is vulnerable to XSS. Specifically, the `login`, `password`, `email`, and `answer` fields are all susceptible to injecting malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable fields. This code could be executed when a user views the registration form, potentially leading to various malicious activities such as:
    *   Session hijacking: Stealing user session cookies.
    *   Credential theft: Capturing user input data.
    *   Redirecting users to phishing sites.
    *   Defacing the website.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is the registration form itself.
*   An attacker crafts a malicious payload, such as `<svg/onload=prompt(1337)>`, and injects it into any of the vulnerable form fields.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to submit data to the registration form on the target website.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
*   The attacker can trigger the vulnerability by simply submitting a crafted registration request.

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided HTTP POST request demonstrates the attack:

    ```
    POST /monstra/users/registration HTTP/1.1
    Host: localhost
    ...
    Content-Length: 142
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    csrf=803ee6c7fc318793f6378e0a7e22257ff8a7ea48&login="><svg/onload=prompt(1337)>&password=&email=&answer=&register=Register
    ```
*   The vulnerability is triggered by the `login` field containing the XSS payload: `"><svg/onload=prompt(1337)>`.
*  The other fields are stated as also vulnerable to XSS.
