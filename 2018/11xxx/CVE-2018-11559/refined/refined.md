{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when updating user profile information.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
    "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users, leading to account takeover or privilege escalation. A read-only user can leverage a stored XSS payload and CSRF to add administrator accounts, promote themselves to admin, or change admin passwords.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the 'new_first_name' and 'new_last_name' fields of the user profile update form.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a read-only user with access to the profile update form. The attacker also needs the ability to perform a CSRF attack to exploit the vulnerability fully."
