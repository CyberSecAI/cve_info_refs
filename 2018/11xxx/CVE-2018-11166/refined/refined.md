      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have access to the network where the Quest DR Series appliance is accessible. No prior authentication is required for the initial foothold, but most of the command injection vulnerabilities require authentication to exploit, which can be achieved by exploiting the unauthenticated command injection vulnerability. For this particular vulnerability, authentication is required."
