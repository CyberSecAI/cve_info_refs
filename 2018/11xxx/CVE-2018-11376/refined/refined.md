The provided content relates to CVE-2018-11376.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds read in the `r_read_le32` function when processing ELF files with a large number of constructors. The vulnerability occurs in the `process_constructors` function in `libr/bin/p/bin_elf.c`. The code iterates through a section of the ELF file, reading 4 bytes at a time to get an address.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Heap out-of-bounds read:** The loop condition `i < sec->size` allows reading past the allocated buffer, if the size is not a multiple of 4 for 32-bit architectures, or 8 for 64-bit architectures. The code reads 4 bytes at a time via `r_read_le32(buf + i)`. If there are less than 4 remaining bytes in the buffer, it will read out of bounds.
- The issue was that the code was checking only if `i < sec->size` instead of `(i + 3) < sec->size` for 32 bit and `(i + 7) < sec->size` for 64 bit.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Crash:** The out-of-bounds read causes a heap-buffer-overflow and crash.
- **Denial of service:** The crash can lead to a denial-of-service condition, preventing the analysis of ELF files.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by loading a specially crafted ELF file.
- The affected code is in the parsing logic for ELF files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to provide a malicious ELF file to the `radare2` tool which would trigger the vulnerable code path.

**Additional details:**
- The provided content includes the ASAN log which shows the heap-buffer-overflow at `r_read_le32`.
- The fix for the vulnerability is in commit `1f37c04f2a762500222dda2459e6a04646feeedf` where the loop condition was changed from `i < sec->size` to `(i + 3) < sec->size` for 32 bit and `(i + 7) < sec->size` for 64 bit. This commit also adds a check to prevent excessive entrypoints.
