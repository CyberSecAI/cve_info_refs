{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The web application of the Quest DR Series Disk Backup software does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing OS commands, leading to command injection vulnerabilities. The webadmin user has sudo access to several binaries and scripts, allowing privilege escalation to root.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command [CWE-78]",
    "Execution with Unnecessary Privileges [CWE-250]"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary system commands with root privileges on the affected appliance.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerabilities can be exploited through the web interface's JSON-RPC API. Both authenticated and unauthenticated command injection vulnerabilities exist.  Several methods and parameters are vulnerable.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker can exploit some command injections without authentication (e.g., in the login process).  Many other command injections require a valid authentication token. After achieving initial command execution as the 'webadmin' user, attackers can escalate to root due to the user's sudo access to vulnerable binaries and scripts."
