Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2018-11381.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read in the `string_scan_range` function within the `libr/bin/file.c` file of the radare2 project. Specifically, the code reads beyond the allocated buffer when scanning for strings.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap out-of-bounds read: The `string_scan_range` function attempts to read past the allocated buffer on the heap during a string scanning operation. This occurs due to an incorrect calculation of the reading range while processing UTF-8 encoded strings, particularly when handling wide characters.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a crash due to the heap out-of-bounds read, as indicated by the AddressSanitizer (ASAN) log. This can cause the application to terminate unexpectedly.
- The ASAN log also points out the exact location of the issue, which makes it easier to fix.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves loading a specially crafted binary file using radare2 that triggers the vulnerable `string_scan_range` function with a specific byte sequence that leads to an out-of-bounds read when scanning for strings.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted binary file to be processed by radare2.
- No special privileges are required other than running the vulnerable radare2 tool with the crafted input.
- The attacker does not need to be in a specific network or local position.
