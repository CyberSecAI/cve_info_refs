{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input when constructing command strings, leading to command injection vulnerabilities.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command [CWE-78]",
    "Execution with Unnecessary Privileges [CWE-250]"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary system commands on the appliance with root permissions. This includes privilege escalation from web server user to root.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vectors are the various JSON-RPC API methods of the Quest DR Series Disk Backup software that fail to sanitize user-provided input. These include methods such as Logon, update, delete, setCleaner, setReplication, etc.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker can exploit the unauthenticated command injection vulnerability without any credentials. Other vulnerabilities require a valid authentication token. After gaining initial access (even as a low-privilege user like 'webadmin'), the attacker can escalate to root via multiple methods."
