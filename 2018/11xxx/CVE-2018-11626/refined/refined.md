The provided content is a GitHub issue report detailing a stack buffer overflow vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the variable `keys_inst`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The issue report suggests a crash during fuzz testing, implying the vulnerability could lead to denial of service and potentially other forms of code execution by writing past the buffer on the stack.

**Attack vectors:**
- Fuzz testing was used to discover the crash, so providing malformed input to the vulnerable code segment could trigger the overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide malicious input to trigger the vulnerable code path where the `keys_inst` variable is used. The specific code where this happens is not described but the user mentions "my company tools to fuzz test", implying a process that directly interacts with the vulnerable code.
