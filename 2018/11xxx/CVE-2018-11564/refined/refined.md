Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-11564:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of SVG files uploaded through the image upload functionality of the Pagekit CMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS, where malicious JavaScript code embedded within an SVG file is stored on the server and then executed in the browsers of users who access the file.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The CMS fails to properly validate and sanitize uploaded SVG files, allowing them to contain and execute arbitrary scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser.
- **Potential Account Compromise:** This could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, and other actions that could compromise user accounts.
- **Website Defacement or Redirection:** The attacker could manipulate the website's content or redirect users to malicious sites.
- **Malware Distribution:** The attacker could use the vulnerability to distribute malware to website users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload:** The attacker uploads a specially crafted SVG file containing malicious JavaScript code through the image upload functionality of the CMS.
- **Link Creation:** The attacker creates a link within the website that points to the malicious SVG file stored on the server (e.g., `/storage/poc.svg`).
- **User Interaction:** When a user clicks the crafted link, the browser loads and executes the malicious script within the context of the website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to CMS Image Upload:** The attacker needs to be able to access the image upload section of the Pagekit CMS, typically as a registered user with the necessary privileges.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious SVG File:** The attacker must be able to create an SVG file that contains the desired malicious JavaScript.
- **Ability to Create Links:** The attacker needs to create a link within the website that points to the stored malicious SVG file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit code provided in the first document is a python script which creates a SVG file with user specified Javascript code embedded within it.
- The exploit works by embedding the javascript code within the `<exploit:script>` tag which is part of the XHTML namespace.
