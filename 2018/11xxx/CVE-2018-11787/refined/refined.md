Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-11787:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the Pax Web Extender Whiteboard exposing the Gogo shell, which is part of the Karaf webconsole, at an unsecured URL (`/gogo/`). This bypasses the authentication required when accessing the Gogo shell through its intended URL (`/system/console/gogo`). The issue arises because the whiteboard extender makes the Gogo console available at an additional URL without enforcing the necessary authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Access:** The Gogo console, which provides command-line access to the Karaf system, is accessible without authentication via the `/gogo/` URL due to the Pax Web Extender Whiteboard.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The vulnerability allows bypassing the authentication mechanism that protects access to the Gogo console through the `/system/console/` path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full System Access:** Successful exploitation grants an attacker command-line access to the Karaf system. This could lead to the attacker executing arbitrary commands, installing malicious software, and gaining full control of the server.
*   **Data Breach/Manipulation:** An attacker can access and manipulate data stored within the Karaf system, potentially leading to data breaches or corruption.
*   **Service Disruption:** The attacker could disrupt or disable the Karaf service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by accessing the unsecured `/gogo/` URL via HTTP, making it exploitable remotely if the Karaf instance is exposed to the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Karaf instance.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know or discover the vulnerable `/gogo/` URL.
*   **No Authentication Required:**  The attacker does not need valid user credentials to access and interact with the Gogo shell.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue was found in Apache Karaf versions prior to 3.0.9, 4.0.9, and 4.1.1.
*   The fix involves ensuring that the Gogo console is only accessible through authenticated paths.
*   The issue was reported by Kevin Schmidt.

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade to Apache Karaf 3.0.9, 4.0.9, 4.1.1, or later.
*   Alternatively, manually stop/uninstall the Gogo plugin bundle installed with the webconsole feature (but this disables the gogo console from the intended access path as well), or stop/uninstall the Pax Web Extender Whiteboard (though this might break other functionalities).
