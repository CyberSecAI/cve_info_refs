These days, with all the ongoing talk around AI, managing how bots interact with your online content is a big deal. Whether youâre safeguarding private info, controlling who sees your work, or just keeping things neat, FlowPaper makes it super easy. With four simple options, you get to decide exactly what bots can do with your publications. Letâs break it down.

![Control your bots](/resources/blog/bots.png)

### Whatâs the Deal with Bot Indexing?

Bots are everywhere. Search engine bots help people find your content, while AI bots analyze and summarize stuff. Sounds good, right? But not all bots play nice. Some might grab your content without asking, which is where FlowPaper steps in to help.

### FlowPaperâs Four Easy Bot Settings

FlowPaper gives you full control over bot access with four straightforward options. Hereâs the scoop:

#### 1. Disallow All Bots

Want to keep all bots out? This is your go-to. Perfect for:

- Private or confidential documents
- Team-only resources
- Anything you want to stay off the radar

With this setting, no bots will touch your content. Itâs like a digital âDo Not Disturbâ sign.

#### 2. Search Bots Only

Let search engines like Google and Bing index your work, but keep other bots away.
Great for:

- Marketing materials you want people to find
- Research papers for public discovery

This way, your content stays visible to the right audience.

#### 3. AI Bots Only

If youâre cool with AI bots but not search engines, this settingâs for you. Itâs ideal for:

- Data meant for AI tools
- Sharing with developers or researchers

Keep it techy and focused on AI-driven use cases.

#### 4. All Bots Welcome

Want your content out there for everyoneâsearch engines, AI, and beyond? This setting makes your publication an open book. Best for:

- Open-access content
- Anything designed for maximum visibility

![How to control how bots index your publications](/resources/blog/bots2.png)

### How to Set It Up

Getting started is a breeze:

1. Log in to your FlowPaper account at [flowpaper.com/account/](https://flowpaper.com/account/).
2. Look for the "Bot Permission Settings" drop down list.
3. Pick your setting: No Bots, Search Bots Only, AI Bots Only, or All Bots.
4. Save your choice, and youâre good to go!

Your settings will kick in right away, giving you peace of mind and control.

### Why Bother Controlling Bots?

There are plenty of reasons to set some boundaries for bots:

- Protect your stuff: Block unwanted scraping and keep your content safe.
- Be searchable: Show up on search engines while keeping other bots out.
- Get AI-specific: Let AI bots do their thing without involving search engines.
- Keep it private: Share with humans or specific platforms only.
### Wrapping Up

FlowPaper makes it super simple to decide how bots interact with your content. Whether youâre looking for total privacy or maximum exposure, these settings have you covered.

Take charge of your publications today and make bots work the way you want them to. With FlowPaper, itâs all in your hands!

## [Proven Methods to Track PDF Downloads and Boost Website Engagement](/blog/Proven-Methods-to-Track-PDF-Downloads/) ---

 3 December 2024

## Why Track PDF Downloads?

PDFs often contain valuable content that can be used to:
![Track PDF online](/resources/blog/trackPDF.png)- Measure Content Performance: Understand which resources are most downloaded.
- Refine Marketing Strategies: Track ROI on gated content or email campaigns.
- Engage Better with Users: Tailor future content based on download trends.

However, tracking PDF downloads requires special techniques since PDFs donât run JavaScript or integrate directly with analytics tools like webpages do.

# Methods to Track PDF Downloads

## 1. Using Google Tag Manager (GTM)

Google Tag Manager allows you to track PDF downloads with minimal coding.

How It Works:

- Set up a trigger to detect when users click on links ending in .pdf.
- Create a tag to send download data to Google Analytics.

![Google tag manager](/resources/blog/googleTagmanager.png)

### Pros and cons

So what are the benefits about this approach?

- No Code Changes: No need to edit website code for every new PDF link.
- Scalable: Track multiple file types (PDF, DOCX, XLSX) with slight modifications.
- Integration: Works seamlessly with Google Analytics for detailed reporting.

What are some of the negatives with Google Tag Manager?

- Learning Curve: Requires familiarity with GTM to set up correctly.
- Limited Server-Side Coverage: Doesnât track downloads directly accessed via external sources.

## Server-Side Logging

For downloads accessed through direct links (e.g., shared in emails), server-side logging is a reliable method.

How It Works:

- Enable logging for file downloads on your web server.
- Analyze logs using tools like AWStats or custom scripts.

![Server Side Logging](/resources/blog/tracking-serverside.png)

### Pros and cons about this approach?

Pros:

- Covers All Access Points: Tracks downloads even if users access PDFs without visiting your site.
- Independent of Front-End Tools: Works without JavaScript or third-party analytics tools.

Cons:

- Technical Expertise Needed: Requires server configuration knowledge.
- No User Details: Limited ability to track user behaviors like session context or referral sources.

## Using FlowPaper for PDF Tracking

FlowPaper is a digital publishing tool that allows you to embed and track PDFs directly within your website. By embedding PDFs as interactive elements, FlowPaper provides detailed insights into user engagement.

![Traditional Embed](/resources/blog/flowpaper-embed.jpg)

How It Works:

1. Upload your PDF to FlowPaper and generate an embed code.
2. Place the embed code on your website where you want the PDF to appear.
3. Use FlowPaperâs built-in analytics dashboard to track:

* Views: How often the PDF was accessed.
* Page Reads: how many times a specific page has been read.
* Page Interactions: Which pages users read and for how long.
* Heatmap: collect statistics on how much time people are spending on different parts of your pages

### Pros and cons about using FlowPaper?

Pros:

- Rich Engagement Data: Tracks user interactions with specific pages within the PDF.
- Embedded Experience: Keeps users on your website instead of downloading the file.
- Custom Branding: Offers a professional presentation with your branding.

Cons:

- Requires a License: FlowPaper offers free and paid plans, with advanced analytics requiring a premium subscription.

## [How to best convert PDF to HTML5](/blog/Best-ways-to-convert-PDF-to-HTML5/) ---

 16 October 2024

Converting PDF files into HTML5 format is essential for making your documents more interactive, accessible, and mobile-friendly. Whether you're a web developer, content creator, or business owner, transforming your PDFs into HTML5 opens the door to better user experience and SEO benefits. This document outlines some of the best ways to convert your document to HTML5 with a small guide attached to each of the options.

![Traditional Embed](/resources/blog/opensourcehtml5.jpg)

## Using an open source tool: Calibre

Calibre is an open-source e-book management tool, but it also includes PDF to HTML conversion capabilities. Although originally designed for e-books, it works well for converting PDFs into HTML5 format.

### Step 1: Download and Install Calibre

If you donât already have Calibre installed, you can [download it from the Calibre website](https://calibre-ebook.com/).
Install it following the instructions for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).

### Step 2: Open Calibre and Import Your PDF

Launch Calibre after installation.
To add your PDF file, click on the âAdd booksâ button in the top left corner.
Browse and select the PDF file you want to convert to HTML.

### Step 3: Convert the PDF to HTML

Once the PDF is added to Calibre, select it from your library list by clicking on it.
Click the âConvert booksâ button in the toolbar.
A new window will appear with various conversion options.

### Step 4: Select Output Format: HTML

In the âConvert booksâ window, go to the top-right corner where youâll see the âOutput formatâ drop-down menu.
Select âZIPâ from the list of output formats. HTML is outputted as a zipped folder containing multiple files (HTML, images, etc.).

### Step 5: Start the Conversion

After adjusting the settings, click the âOKâ button to begin converting your document.
Calibre will start processing the PDF, and youâll see a notification when the conversion is complete.

### Step 5: Retrieve the HTML Files

Once the conversion is finished, navigate to the âJobsâ area (bottom right corner) to see the progress.
After the conversion, the ZIP file containing the HTML will be saved.
To access the files, right-click on your converted file in the library and select âOpen containing folderâ.
Extract the HTML files from the ZIP folder.

### Pros and cons

So what are the benefits about this approach?

- Can embed PDFs directly into web pages.
- Offers control over rendering, allowing you to manipulate pages.
- Fully client-side, so it works without any server processing.
- Ideal for web developers who want more control over how the PDF content is displayed.

What are some of the negatives with using Calibre?

- Complex Layouts May Not Convert Well
- No Direct HTML5 Output
- Limited Control Over Styling

![Traditional Embed](/resources/blog/mupdf.jpg)

## Using a command line tool: MuPDF

MuPDF is a lightweight PDF viewer that also includes command-line tools for converting PDFs to other formats, including HTML.

### Step 1: Download and Install MuPDF

Visit the MuPDF official website to download the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). After downloading, install the application by following the instructions for your operating system.

### Step 2: Open a Command Line Interface (CLI)

For Windows: Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.

For macOS or Linux: Open the Terminal.

### Step 3: Navigate to the MuPDF Directory

Use the cd command to navigate to the folder where you installed MuPDF or where the mutool executable is located. For example:

```

cd /path/to/mupdf

```

### Step 4: Run the Conversion Command

The mutool command is used to convert PDF files to HTML. The basic syntax is:

```

mutool convert -o output.html input.pdf

```

### Step 5: View the HTML Output

After running the conversion, the output.html file will be generated in the current directory.
Open the resulting HTML file in a web browser to check the output.

### Pros and cons

So what are the benefits about using MuPDF?

- Lightweight and Fast
- Open-Source and Free. Worth to note though is that is using AGPL which is somewhat restrictive.
- Supports High-Quality Output

What are some of the negatives with using MuPDF?

- Command-Line Interface (CLI) Only
- Limited Complex Layout Handling
- Basic HTML Output

## [How to best embed PDF files on a website](/blog/Embed-PDF-files-on-website/) ---

 11 August 2024

When it comes to embedding PDF files on a web page, there are different ways to skin a cat. Whether you're sharing an ebook, a whitepaper, or a brochure, embedding PDFs directly onto your site allows visitors to view the content without ever leaving your page. In this post, weâll explore a few simple methods to help you get those PDFs seamlessly integrated into your website.

![Traditional Embed](/resources/blog/traditional.jpg)
## The old school way: iframes

### Step 1: Upload Your PDF File

First things first, you need to upload your PDF file to your website's server. You can do this via your websiteâs content management system (CMS) or an FTP client. If youâre using a CMS like WordPress, navigate to the media library and upload the PDF file just like you would an image or video.

#### Step 2: Get the PDF URL

Once your PDF file is uploaded, locate the file in your media library or on your server. Copy the URL of the PDF file, as youâll need this in the next step. This URL is the direct link to your PDF, and itâs what youâll use to embed the file on your web page.

#### Step 3: Embed the PDF in Your Web Page

Now, it's time to embed the PDF into your web page. You can do this in a few different ways:
Using HTML: The simplest way is to use an <iframe> tag. Hereâs an example:
```

<iframe src="YOUR_PDF_URL" width="600" height="800" style="border:none;"></iframe>

```

So what are the positives and negatives about this approach?

Pro's:
- No external libraries required

Con's:
- Not responsive
- Hard to customize
- Not accessible
- Hard to navigate in small embeds
- No analytics

![PDFJS Embed](/resources/blog/pdfjs-embed.jpg)
## Embedding PDF files using PDF.JS

If you're a bit more of a web developer, then PDF.js is could be a fantastic option. In this post, weâll walk you through the steps to seamlessly embed PDFs into your website using PDF.js.
### Step 1: Download PDF.js

To get started, you need to download the PDF.js library. Follow these steps:- Download the Library: Go to the PDF.js GitHub repository and download the latest release. Extract the files to a directory on your server.
- Host the Library Files: Upload the pdf.js and pdf.worker.js files from the build directory to your server. Youâll reference these files in your HTML code.

### Step 2: Create a HTML Container

Next, you need to create a HTML container where the PDF will be rendered. Hereâs a basic setup:
```

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>PDF Viewer</title>
</head>
<body>
    <canvas id="pdf-canvas" style="border:1px solid black;"></canvas>

    <script src="path/to/pdf.js"></script>
    <script src="path/to/pdf.worker.js"></script>
</body>
</html>

```
Replace "path/to/pdf.js" and "path/to/pdf.worker.js" with the actual paths to these files on your server.
### Step 3: Load and Render the PDF

Now, itâs time to write the JavaScript code that will load and render your PDF file using PDF.js.
Hereâs how to do it:
```

<script>
    var url = 'YOUR_PDF_URL';

    // Asynchronously download the PDF
    pdfjsLib.getDocument(url).promise.then(function(pdf) {
        // Fetch the first page
        pdf.getPage(1).then(function(page) {
            var scale = 1.5;
            var viewport = page.getViewport({scale: scale});

            // Prepare canvas using PDF page dimensions
            var canvas = document.getElementById('pdf-canvas');
            var context = canvas.getContext('2d');
            canvas.height = viewport.height;
            canvas.width = viewport.width;

            // Render PDF page into canvas context
            var renderContext = {
                canvasContext: context,
                viewport: viewport
            };
            page.render(renderContext);
        });
    });
</script>

```
Replace "YOUR\_PDF\_URL" with the URL of the PDF file you want to embed. The scale variable controls the zoom level of the PDF. And that's it! You should now be able to see the embedded PDF file on your web page.

So what are some positives and negatives?

Pro's:
- If you have some CSS skills then you can customize the look of the viewer

Con's:
- Slow performance with big PDFs
- Not easy to use on small devices
- No analytics
