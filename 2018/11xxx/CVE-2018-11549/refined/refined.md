- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when processing the QQ number field in the member profile settings, leading to stored XSS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the affected profile page. This can lead to session hijacking, stealing of cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, and potentially more.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with a valid user account can navigate to "Account Settings -> Member Centre -> Chinese information -> Ordinary member" and inject malicious javascript code into the QQ number form field. The malicious code gets stored in the database and will be executed when the profile page is viewed by other users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs a registered user account to access and modify the profile settings.
