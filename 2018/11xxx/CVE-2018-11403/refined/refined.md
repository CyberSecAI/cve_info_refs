Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-11403:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The provided content explicitly mentions "CVE-2018-11403" and describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in DomainMod version 4.09.03. This aligns with the CVE ID, confirming relevance.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the `account-owner.php` and `ssl-provider-account.php` files. Specifically, the `oid` and `sslpaid` parameters are vulnerable to XSS injection.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS through the `oid` and `sslpaid` GET parameters. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts, potentially leading to:
     - Stealing user session cookies and other sensitive information.
     - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
     - Defacing the web application.
     - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Malicious URL:** The primary attack vector is through specially crafted URLs containing the malicious script payload within the `oid` or `sslpaid` parameters. These URLs can be delivered via email, social media, or other means.
  
   - Two vulnerable URLs were provided:
        -  `http://127.0.0.1/assets/edit/ssl-provider-account.php?del=1&sslpaid=%27%22%28%29%26%25%3Cacx%3E%3CScRiPt%20%3Eprompt%28931289%29%3C/ScRiPt%3E`
        -  `http://127.0.0.1/assets/edit/account-owner.php?del=1&oid=%27%22%28%29%26%25%3Cacx%3E%3CScRiPt%20%3Eprompt%28973761%29%3C/ScRiPt%3E`

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Remote Attacker:** The attacker does not need local access to the server.
   - **User Interaction:** The victim user needs to click on the malicious URL while logged in to the application.
   - **Knowledge of Target:** The attacker needs to know that the target application uses DomainMod version 4.09.03 and be able to construct a malicious URL.
