Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-11392

**Vulnerability:** Arbitrary File Upload leading to Remote Code Execution

**Affected Product:** PHP Login & User Management script by Jigowatt (versions prior to 4.1.1)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper file extension validation during avatar uploads. The application uses `getimagesize()` function to check if a file is a valid image, which can be bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insecure file upload:** The application does not properly validate the file type of the uploaded avatar. It relies solely on the `getimagesize()` function, which is not a reliable method for verifying file types and can be bypassed with specially crafted files.
*   **Lack of file extension whitelist/blacklist:** The application does not restrict the allowed file extensions for uploads, which allows an attacker to upload a file with a malicious extension like PHP.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can upload a malicious PHP file disguised as an image and execute arbitrary code on the server by accessing the uploaded file's URL. This allows full control over the web server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **File Upload:** The attacker leverages the user profile avatar upload feature.
*   **Image Manipulation:** An attacker uses tools like `gifsicle` to embed malicious PHP code inside a valid image file that can bypass the `getimagesize()` check.
*   **File Extension Modification:** The attacker intercepts the upload request and modifies the filename extension to `.php`, causing the server to execute the malicious PHP code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Registered User:** The attacker needs a valid user account on the affected application to access the avatar upload functionality.
*   **Network Interception:** The attacker needs to intercept the HTTP POST request during file upload, usually using a tool like Burp Suite.
*   **Technical Skill:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of how to embed malicious code into image files and manipulate HTTP requests.

**Additional details:**

* The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on April 28, 2018, and a fix was made available on May 15, 2018.
* The detailed write-up was published on December 8, 2018, demonstrating a proof-of-concept.
* The attacker used `gifsicle` to embed PHP code into an image, which can be used to bypass the getimagesize function.
* The attacker used Burp Suite to change the file extension of the uploaded image to `.php` to enable code execution.
