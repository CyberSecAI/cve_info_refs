  "CVE-2018-11354": {
    "Description": "In Wireshark 2.6.0, the IEEE 1905.1a dissector could crash. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-ieee1905.c by making a certain correction to string handling.",
    "Root cause": "Improper string handling in the IEEE 1905.1a dissector.",
     "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect string handling that leads to a crash."
    ],
    "Impact": "A malformed packet or trace file can crash Wireshark, leading to a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network injection of malformed packets.",
       "Opening a malformed trace file."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to craft network packets or modify a trace file with malformed data. No authentication is required."
  },
   "CVE-2018-11356": {
    "Description": "In Wireshark 2.6.0, 2.4.0 to 2.4.6, and 2.2.0 to 2.2.14, the DNS dissector could crash. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-dns.c by avoiding a NULL pointer dereference for an empty name in an SRV record.",
    "Root cause": "A NULL pointer dereference when handling an empty name within an SRV record in the DNS dissector.",
     "Weaknesses": [
       "Null pointer dereference vulnerability."
    ],
    "Impact": "A malformed DNS response or crafted packet can cause Wireshark to crash.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "Network injection of malformed DNS packets.",
      "Opening a malformed trace file containing malformed DNS data."
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to send or capture network traffic. No authentication is required."
  },
    "CVE-2018-11357": {
    "Description": "In Wireshark 2.6.0, 2.4.0 to 2.4.6, and 2.2.0 to 2.2.14, the LTP dissector and other dissectors could consume excessive memory. This was addressed in epan/tvbuff.c by rejecting negative lengths.",
    "Root cause": "The dissectors could consume excessive memory due to not rejecting negative lengths.",
    "Weaknesses": [
       "Insufficient input validation leading to excessive memory consumption."
    ],
    "Impact": "A crafted or malformed packet can cause Wireshark to consume excessive memory potentially leading to a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network injection of crafted packets",
        "Opening a trace file with malformed data"
     ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to craft packets or modify trace files, and the ability to send network packets or capture and open a malformed trace file."
