Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-11440:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a **stack-based buffer overflow** within the `parseChars` function located in `compileTranslationTable.c` of the Liblouis library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `parseChars` function does not properly validate the size of input data when writing to a stack buffer, allowing an attacker to overwrite memory on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution**: According to the Ubuntu Security Notice, this vulnerability could be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS)**: The github issue and USN notes also mention the potential for a denial of service, which is confirmed by the AddressSanitizer output that shows a crash due to the buffer overflow.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously crafted table files:** The vulnerability is triggered when processing specially crafted table files (.ctb) which are used for braille translation.
*   **Local or Remote**: While the github issue shows the crash occurring locally, the SUSE and Ubuntu advisories describe the attack vector as potentially remote.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted table file to be processed by the vulnerable Liblouis library.
*   The attacker must be able to trigger the vulnerable code path of the `parseChars` function when processing the crafted table.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing with American Fuzzy Lop (AFL).
*   The issue was present in liblouis versions 3.5.0 and earlier, as well as the commit `ed6b00a`.
*   Multiple sources mention that there are other stack based buffer overflows in `compileTranslationTable.c` related to this CVE. (See CVE-2018-11683, CVE-2018-11684, CVE-2018-11685)
*   Patches were released to fix the vulnerability in various Linux distributions including Ubuntu and openSUSE.
