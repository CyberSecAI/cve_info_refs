  "CVE-2018-11040": {
    "Metadata": {
      "CNA": "Spring",
      "Description": "Spring Framework, versions 5.0.x prior to 5.0.7, versions 4.3.x prior to 4.3.18, and older unsupported versions, allows web applications to enable cross-domain requests via JSONP (JSON with Padding) through AbstractJsonpResponseBodyAdvice for REST controllers, and MappingJackson2JsonView for browser requests. Both are not enabled by default in Spring Framework nor Spring Boot. However when MappingJackson2JsonView is configured in an application, JSONP support is automatically ready to use through the \"jsonp\" and \"callback\" JSONP parameters, enabling cross-domain requests.\n\nAllowing cross-domain requests from untrusted origins may expose user information to 3rd party browser scripts.\n\nThis vulnerability applies to applications that:\n\n    *   Explicitly configure MappingJackson2JsonView.\n    *   And do not set the jsonpParameterNames property of MappingJackson2JsonView to an empty set.\n    *   And expose sensitive user information over endpoints that can render content with JSONP.",
        "Patched Versions": [
            "5.0.7",
            "4.3.18"
          ]
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is that when `MappingJackson2JsonView` is configured in an application, JSONP support is automatically enabled through the `jsonp` and `callback` parameters. This feature allows cross-domain requests, which may expose user information to third-party browser scripts if not properly managed.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Enabling JSONP support by default when `MappingJackson2JsonView` is configured, which can lead to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) like attacks if the jsonpParameterNames property is not correctly managed, exposing application endpoints to external scripts that can access sensitive data."
      ],
      "Impact": "If exploited, this vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive user information by enabling cross-domain requests from untrusted origins.",
      "Attack Vectors": "This vulnerability can be exploited through web requests by using JSONP parameters such as jsonp and callback.",
      "Required Capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send web requests and target endpoints that are able to render content with JSONP and that expose sensitive information."
