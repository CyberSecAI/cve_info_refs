# ClipperCMS 1.3.3 - Cross-Site Scripting

#### EDB-ID:

###### 44775

**Vulnerable App:**

```
# Exploit Title: ClipperCMS 1.3.3 Persistent XSS on 'Site name' field
# Date: 05/27/2018
# Exploit Author: Nathu Nandwani
# Website: http://nandtech.co/
# Vendor Homepage: http://www.clippercms.com/
# Software Link: https://github.com/ClipperCMS/ClipperCMS/releases/tag/clipper_1.3.3
# Version: 1.3.3
# Tested on: Windows 10 x64 (XAMPP, Chrome)
# CVE: CVE-2018-11332

*Description

A persistent/stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Site Name" field found in the "site" tab under configurations in ClipperCMS 1.3.3 has been discovered because it didn't sanitize user input. It allows authenticated remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted site name to the manager/processors/save_settings.processor.php file.

*Proof of Concept

1. Attacker logs in as an administrator of the site.
2. Attacker visits the tools->configurations tab and enters the script below in the "Site name" field:
<script>alert('XSS')</script>
3. Once the "Save" button is clicked, the payload will execute.
4. When an unauthenticated user visits the login page "ClipperCMS/manager/", the payload will also execute.

*Mitigation

See https://github.com/nathunandwani/ClipperCMS/commit/f286fbfa81dc3728dbbf6d9d817c8848edcad0b2

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Description

[![@nathunandwani](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11877783?v=4&size=48)](/nathunandwani)[nathunandwani](https://github.com/nathunandwani)opened [on May 22, 2018](https://github.com/ClipperCMS/ClipperCMS/issues/483#issue-325273131)

Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Site Name" field found in the "site" tab under configurations in ClipperCMS 1.3.3 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted site name by doing an authenticated POST HTTP request to ClipperCMS/manager/processors/save\_settings.processor.php.

This vulnerability is specifically the "Site Name" field found under the Configuration->Site tab. Here's an output when the payload <script>alert(1)</script> is entered and saved.

Upon saving through the field:

[![xss on save](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11877783/40362320-c3fff8f2-5dfe-11e8-9643-93575a92a3d5.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11877783/40362320-c3fff8f2-5dfe-11e8-9643-93575a92a3d5.png)

Upon visiting the login page:

[![xss on page visit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11877783/40362310-be8e1a0c-5dfe-11e8-8d21-431b53bc8e8d.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11877783/40362310-be8e1a0c-5dfe-11e8-8d21-431b53bc8e8d.png)

If the data is not sanitized upon input (Site name), these components are going to return arbitrary web script or HTML that can be rendered by the browser because of having `<?php echo $site_name; ?>`, hence, the "Affected Components" are as follow:

-/manager/actions/mutate\_settings.dynamic.php

-/manager/actions/import\_site.static.php

-/manager/actions/mutate\_content.dynamic.php

-/manager/frames/1.php

-/manager/frames/tree.php

-/manager/frames/menu.php
