{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Legacy IVR systems using audio frequencies to process commands are vulnerable to phreaking attacks because these frequencies can be recorded and replayed to activate services or gain sensitive information.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The IVR systems lack proper request verification, particularly when activating services via predictable DTMF signals. They accept input from less-secure channels (loudspeakers) without ensuring the request is intended by matching it with a nonce sent over a more-secure channel (earpiece).",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can activate services or obtain sensitive information by replaying recorded DTMF frequencies, potentially leading to unauthorized actions on user accounts. In public spaces, playing these frequencies loudly can affect multiple IVR calls.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker records and then replays the DTMF frequencies through a loudspeaker or other audio source to manipulate the IVR system.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to record DTMF tones from an IVR system and then rebroadcast them to a vulnerable system."
