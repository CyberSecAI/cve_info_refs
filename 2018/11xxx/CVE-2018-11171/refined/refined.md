Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-11171:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a command injection flaw in the `delete` method of the `DRReplications` module. This occurs because the software does not properly sanitize the `name` parameter before using it in a system command.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (CWE-78):** The core issue is that user-supplied input (`name` parameter) is directly incorporated into a system command without adequate sanitization, allowing for command injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands with the privileges of the web application.
*   **Privilege escalation:** When combined with other vulnerabilities, this can lead to full system compromise with root privileges.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible over the network via the web interface.
*   **JSON-RPC API:** The vulnerable `delete` method is part of the JSON-RPC API exposed by the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must have a valid authentication token to access the vulnerable `delete` method.
*   **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the target system in order to send crafted requests to the JSON-RPC API.

**Technical Details:**

* The advisory provides a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating how to inject a command via the `name` parameter using a POST request to the `/ws/v1.0/jsonrpc` endpoint, sending a JSON payload with a malicious `name` value (e.g., `'; sleep 15; #'`).

*   The advisory also explains that there are multiple other command injection vulnerabilities and several privilege escalation vulnerabilities. Exploiting any command injection vulnerability grants the attacker initial access which can be leveraged further using the privilege escalation flaws, leading to root access.

**Additional Information:**

*   The advisory includes a timeline of communication with the vendor.
*   The advisory explicitly states that it has limited technical details due to the vendor threatening legal action.
*   It's one of many command injection and privilege escalation vulnerabilities found in the Quest DR Series Disk Backup Software.
