  "CVE-2018-11813": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `read_pixel` function in `rdtarga.c` mishandles the end-of-file (EOF) condition, leading to a large loop.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper handling of EOF in the `read_pixel` function.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service via crafted JPG files, leading to a large loop and excessive resource consumption.",
      "Attack vectors": "Crafted JPG files processed by `cjpeg` or similar utilities.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted JPG file to the vulnerable software."

  "CVE-2018-14498": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Heap-based buffer over-read in `get_8bit_row` function within `rdbmp.c` due to a crafted 8-bit BMP image with out-of-range color indices.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap-based buffer over-read in the `get_8bit_row` function.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A crafted BMP image can cause a denial of service (application crash) due to a heap-based buffer over-read, also a potential for information disclosure based on the OOB read",
      "Attack vectors": "Processing a crafted 8-bit BMP image where color indices are out of range for the palette.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs the ability to supply a crafted 8-bit BMP image to the vulnerable application."

    {
       "Root cause of vulnerability": "A heap-based buffer over-read occurs in the `get_8bit_row` function of `rdbmp.c`, triggered by a crafted 8-bit BMP where color indices exceed the number of palette entries.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in improper bounds checking in `get_8bit_row`, which reads outside the allocated heap buffer when processing a malicious BMP.",
       "Impact of exploitation": "Exploitation leads to a denial-of-service condition, specifically an application crash due to the heap-based buffer over-read.",
      "Attack vectors": "An attacker must provide the vulnerable application with a specially crafted 8-bit BMP image, where color indices are out of range.",

        "Root cause of vulnerability": "A divide-by-zero error in `start_input_bmp()` within `rdbmp.c` when processing a crafted BMP image.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is caused by a missing check for zero value before division operation.",
