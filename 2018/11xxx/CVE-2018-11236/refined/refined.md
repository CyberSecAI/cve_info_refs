  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow in the `realpath` function when processing long pathnames on 32-bit architectures.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Integer overflow leading to stack-based buffer overflow.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "Processing a long pathname argument to the `realpath` function.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker can supply a long pathname argument to the vulnerable `realpath` function."
