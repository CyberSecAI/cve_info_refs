Don't write beyond destination in \_\_mempcpy\_avx512\_no\_vzeroupper (bug 23196)

When compiled as mempcpy, the return value is the end of the destination

buffer, thus it cannot be used to refer to the start of it.

(cherry picked from commit [9aaaab7c6e4176e61c59b0a63c6ba906d875dc0e](/git?p=glibc.git;a=object;h=9aaaab7c6e4176e61c59b0a63c6ba906d875dc0e))

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1581274#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2018-05-22 12:53:11 UTC  ```  An AVX-512-optimized implementation of the mempcpy function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.27 and earlier may write data beyond the target buffer, leading to a buffer overflow in __mempcpy_avx512_no_vzeroupper.  Upstream issue:  <https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=23196>  Product bug:  [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1579809](show_bug.cgi?id=1579809)   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1581274#c1)  Andrej Nemec    2018-05-22 12:54:30 UTC  ``` Created glibc tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1581275](show_bug.cgi?id=1581275 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-11237 glibc: Buffer overflow in __mempcpy_avx512_no_vzeroupper [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1581274#c4)  Riccardo Schirone    2018-05-24 08:16:23 UTC  ``` Patch: <https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=glibc.git;h=9aaaab7c6e4176e61c59b0a63c6ba906d875dc0e>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1581274#c5)  Riccardo Schirone    2018-05-24 08:25:23 UTC  ``` The vulnerable code can be reached only in particular configurations and in particular cases. First, mempcpy has to be resolved to __mempcpy_avx512_no_vzeroupper, thus the CPU needs to support AVX512 instructions. Moreover, the size to be copied has to be greater than a dynamic value internal to glibc and other conditions need to apply.  For these reasons, I'm setting Attack Complexity to High (AC:H).   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1581274#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-10-30 07:36:24 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2018:3092 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3092](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A3092)   ``` |  |

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

[BZ #23137]          On s390 (31bit) if glibc is build with -Os, pthread_join sometimes     blocks indefinitely. This is e.g. observable with     testcase intl/tst-gettext6.          pthread_join is calling lll_wait_tid(tid), which performs the futex-wait     syscall in a loop as long as tid != 0 (thread is alive).          On s390 (and build with -Os), tid is loaded from memory before     comparing against zero and then the tid is loaded a second time     in order to pass it to the futex-wait-syscall.     If the thread exits in between, then the futex-wait-syscall is     called with the value zero and it waits until a futex-wake occurs.     As the thread is already exited, there won't be a futex-wake.          In lll_wait_tid, the tid is stored to the local variable __tid,     which is then used as argument for the futex-wait-syscall.     But unfortunately the compiler is allowed to reload the value     from memory.          With this patch, the tid is loaded with atomic_load_acquire.     Then the compiler is not allowed to reload the value for __tid from memory.          ChangeLog:          	[BZ #23137]     	* sysdeps/nptl/lowlevellock.h (lll_wait_tid):     	Use atomic_load_acquire to load __tid.

This results in a     (size_t) -2 return value, so the function always returns NULL.          The size computation for the heap allocation of the result was     incorrect because it did not deal with integer overflow.          Error checking was missing, and the allocated memory was not freed on     error paths.  All error returns now set errno.  (Note that there is an     assumption that free does not clobber errno.)          The slightly unportable comparision against (size_t) -2 to catch both     (size_t) -1 and (size_t) -2 return values is gone as well.

As described in bug report, i386 Linux     (and compat on x86_64) interprets SA_RESTORER clear with nonzero     sa_restorer as a request for stack switching if the SS segment is 'funny'.     This means that anything that tries to mix glibc's signal handling with     segmentation (for instance through modify_ldt syscall) is randomly broken     depending on what values lands in sa_restorer.          The testcase added  is based on Linux test tools/testing/selftests/x86/ldt_gdt.c,     more specifically in do_multicpu_tests function.  The main changes are:            - C11 atomics instead of plain access.            - Remove x86_64 support which simplifies the syscall handling and fallbacks.            - Replicate only the test required to trigger the issue.

Unlike other nscd caches, the netgroup cache contains two types of     records - those for "iterate through a netgroup" (i.e. setnetgrent())     and those for "is this user in this netgroup" (i.e. innetgr()),     i.e. full and partial records.  The timeout code assumes these records     have the same key for the group name, so that the collection of records     that is "this netgroup" can be expired as a unit.          However, the keys are not the same, as the in-netgroup key is generated     by nscd rather than being passed to it from elsewhere, and is generated     without the trailing NUL.  All other keys have the trailing NUL, and as     noted in the linked BZ, debug statements confirm that two keys for the     same netgroup are added to the cache with two different lengths.          The result of this is that as records in the cache expire, the purge     code only cleans out one of the two types of entries, resulting in     stale, possibly incorrect, and possibly inconsistent cache data.          The patch simply includes the existing NUL in the computation for the     key length ('key' points to the char after the NUL, and 'group' to the     first char of the group, so 'key-group' includes the first char to the     NUL, inclusive).

However binutils     recently changed it and now VLE configured gas does not support to     assembler some instruction that might class with VLE (HTM for     instance).  It also does not help that glibc build hardware lock     elision support as default (regardless of assembler support).          Although runtime will not actually enables TLE on SPE hardware     (since kernel will not advertise it), I see little advantage on     adding HTM support on SPE built glibc.  SPE uses an incompatible     ABI which does not allow share the same build with default     powerpc and HTM code slows down SPE without any benefict.          This patch fixes it by only building HTM when SPE configuration     is not used.          Checked with a powerpc-linux-gnuspe build. I also did some sniff     tests on a e500 hardware without any issue.

hooks/post-receive script. It was generated because a ref change was pushed to the repository containing the project "GNU C Library master sources".  The annotated tag, glibc-2.28 has been created         at  0774a9618b539692317d0950477e16a8c5074caf (tag)    tagging  3c03baca37fdcb52c3881e653ca392bba7a99c2b (commit)   replaces  glibc-2.27.9000  tagged by  Carlos O'Donell         on  Wed Aug 1 01:20:23 2018 -0400  - Log ----------------------------------------------------------------- The GNU C Library =================  The GNU C Library version 2.28 is now available.  The GNU C Library is used as *the* C library in the GNU system and in GNU/Linux systems, as well as many other systems that use Linux as the kernel.  The GNU C Library is primarily designed to be a portable and high performance C library.  It follows all relevant standards including ISO C11 and POSIX.1-2008.  It is also internationalized and has one of the most complete internationalization interfaces known.  The GNU C Library webpage is at <http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/>  Packages for the 2.28 release may be downloaded from:         <http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/libc/>         <http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/libc/>  The mirror list is at <http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html>  NEWS for version 2.28 =====================  Major new features:  * The localization data for ISO 14651 is updated to match the 2016   Edition 4 release of the standard, this matches data provided by   Unicode 9.0.0.  This update introduces significant improvements to the   collation of Unicode characters.  This release deviates slightly from   the standard in that the collation element ordering for lowercase and   uppercase LATIN script characters is adjusted to ensure that regular   expressions with ranges like [a-z] and [A-Z] don't interleave e.g. A   is not matched by [a-z].  With the update many locales have been   updated to take advantage of the new collation information.  The new   collation information has increased the size of the compiled locale   archive or binary locales.  * The GNU C Library can now be compiled with support for Intel CET, AKA   Intel Control-flow Enforcement Technology.  When the library is built   with --enable-cet, the resulting glibc is protected with indirect   branch tracking (IBT) and shadow stack (SHSTK).  CET-enabled glibc is   compatible with all existing executables and shared libraries.  This   feature is currently supported on i386, x86_64 and x32 with GCC 8 and   binutils 2.29 or later.  Note that CET-enabled glibc requires CPUs   capable of multi-byte NOPs, like x86-64 processors as well as Intel   Pentium Pro or newer.  NOTE: --enable-cet has been tested for i686,   x86_64 and x32 on non-CET processors.  --enable-cet has been tested   for x86_64 and x32 on CET SDVs, but Intel CET support hasn't been   validated for i686.  * The GNU C Library now has correct support for ABSOLUTE symbols   (SHN_ABS-relative symbols).  Previously such ABSOLUTE symbols were   relocated incorrectly or in some cases discarded.  The GNU linker can   make use of the newer semantics, but it must communicate it to the   dynamic loader by setting the ELF file's identification (EI_ABIVERSION   field) to indicate such support is required.  * Unicode 11.0.0 Support: Character encoding, character type info, and   transliteration tables are all updated to Unicode 11.0.0, using   generator scripts contributed by Mike FABIAN (Red Hat).  * <math.h> functions that round their results to a narrower type are added   from TS 18661-1:2014 and TS 18661-3:2015:    - fadd, faddl, daddl and corresponding fMaddfN, fMaddfNx, fMxaddfN and     fMxaddfNx functions.    - fsub, fsubl, dsubl and corresponding fMsubfN, fMsubfNx, fMxsubfN and     fMxsubfNx functions.    - fmul, fmull, dmull and corresponding fMmulfN, fMmulfNx, fMxmulfN and     fMxmulfNx functions.    - fdiv, fdivl, ddivl and corresponding fMdivfN, fMdivfNx, fMxdivfN and     fMxdivfNx functions.  * Two grammatical forms of month names are now supported for the following   languages: Armenian, Asturian, Catalan, Czech, Kashubian, Occitan, Ossetian,   Scottish Gaelic, Upper Sorbian, and Walloon.  The following languages now   support two grammatical forms in abbreviated month names: Catalan, Greek,   and Kashubian.  * Newly added locales: Lower Sorbian (dsb_DE) and Yakut (sah_RU) also   include the support for two grammatical forms of month names.  * Building and running on GNU/Hurd systems now works without out-of-tree   patches.  * The renameat2 function has been added, a variant of the renameat function   which has a flags argument.  If the flags are zero, the renameat2 function   acts like renameat.  If the flag is not zero and there is no kernel   support for renameat2, the function will fail with an errno value of   EINVAL.  This is different from the existing gnulib function renameatu,   which performs a plain rename operation in case of a RENAME_NOREPLACE   flags and a non-existing destination (and therefore has a race condition   that can clobber the destination inadvertently).  * The statx function has been added, a variant of the fstatat64   function with an additional flags argument.  If there is no direct   kernel support for statx, glibc provides basic stat support based on   the fstatat64 function.  * IDN domain names in getaddrinfo and getnameinfo now use the system libidn2   library if installed.  libidn2 version 2.0.5 or later is recommended.  If   libidn2 is not available, internationalized domain names are not encoded   or decoded even if the AI_IDN or NI_IDN flags are passed to getaddrinfo or   getnameinfo.  (getaddrinfo calls with non-ASCII names and AI_IDN will fail   with an encoding error.)  Flags which used to change the IDN encoding and   decoding behavior (AI_IDN_ALLOW_UNASSIGNED, AI_IDN_USE_STD3_ASCII_RULES,   NI_IDN_ALLOW_UNASSIGNED, NI_IDN_USE_STD3_ASCII_RULES) have been   deprecated.  They no longer have any effect.  * Parsing of dynamic string tokens in DT_RPATH, DT_RUNPATH, DT_NEEDED,   DT_AUXILIARY, and DT_FILTER has been expanded to support the full   range of ELF gABI expressions including such constructs as   '$ORIGIN$ORIGIN' (if valid).  For SUID/GUID applications the rules   have been further restricted, and where in the past a dynamic string   token sequence may have been interpreted as a literal string it will   now cause a load failure.  These load failures were always considered   unspecified behaviour from the perspective of the dynamic loader, and   for safety are now load errors e.g. /foo/${ORIGIN}.so in DT_NEEDED   results in a load failure now.  * Support for ISO C threads (ISO/IEC 9899:2011) has been added.  The   implementation includes all the standard functions provided by   <threads.h>:    - thrd_current, thrd_equal, thrd_sleep, thrd_yield, thrd_create,     thrd_detach, thrd_exit, and thrd_join for thread management.    - mtx_init, mtx_lock, mtx_timedlock, mtx_trylock, mtx_unlock, and     mtx_destroy for mutual exclusion.    - call_once for function call synchronization.    - cnd_broadcast, cnd_destroy, cnd_init, cnd_signal, cnd_timedwait, and     cnd_wait for conditional variables.    - tss_create, tss_delete, tss_get, and tss_set for thread-local storage.    Application developers must link against libpthread to use ISO C threads.  Deprecated and removed features, and other changes affecting compatibility:  * The nonstandard header files <libio.h> and <_G_config.h> are no longer   installed.  Software that was using either header should be updated to   use standard <stdio.h> interfaces instead.  * The stdio functions 'getc' and 'putc' are no longer defined as macros.   This was never required by the C standard, and the macros just expanded   to call alternative names for the same functions.  If you hoped getc and   putc would provide performance improvements over fgetc and fputc, instead   investigate using (f)getc_unlocked and (f)putc_unlocked, and, if   necessary, flockfile and funlockfile.  * All stdio functions now treat end-of-file as a sticky condition.  If you   read from a file until EOF, and then the file is enlarged by another   process, you must call clearerr or another function with the same effect   (e.g. fseek, rewind) before you can read the additional data.  This   corrects a longstanding C99 conformance bug.  It is most likely to affect   programs that use stdio to read interactive input from a terminal.   ([Bug #1190](show_bug.cgi?id=1190 "RESOLVED FIXED - fgetc()/fread() behaviour is not POSIX compliant").)  * The macros 'major', 'minor', and 'makedev' are now only available from   the header <sys/sysmacros.h>; not from <sys/types.h> or various other   headers that happen to include <sys/types.h>.  These macros are rarely   used, not part of POSIX nor XSI, and their names frequently collide with   user code; see [https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=19239](show_bug.cgi?id=19239 "RESOLVED FIXED - Including stdlib.h ends up with macros major and minor being defined") for   further explanation.    <sys/sysmacros.h> is a GNU extension.  Portable programs that require   these macros should first include <sys/types.h>, and then include   <sys/sysmacros.h> if __GNU_LIBRARY__ is defined.  * The tilegx*-*-linux-gnu configurations are no longer supported.  * The obsolete function ustat is no longer available to newly linked   binaries; the headers <ustat.h> and <sys/ustat.h> have been removed.  This   function has been deprecated in favor of fstatfs and statfs.  * The obsolete function nfsservctl is no longer available to newly linked   binaries.  This function was specific to systems using the Linux kernel   and could not usefully be used with the GNU C Library on systems with   version 3.1 or later of the Linux kernel.  * The obsolete function name llseek is no longer available to newly linked   binaries.  This function was specific to systems using the Linux kernel   and was not declared in a header.  Programs should use the lseek64 name   for this function instead.  * The AI_IDN_ALLOW_UNASSIGNED and NI_IDN_ALLOW_UNASSIGNED flags for the   getaddrinfo and getnameinfo functions have been deprecated.  The behavior   previously selected by them is now always enabled.  * The AI_IDN_USE_STD3_ASCII_RULES and NI_IDN_USE_STD3_ASCII_RULES flags for   the getaddrinfo and getnameinfo functions have been deprecated.  The STD3   restriction (rejecting '_' in host names, among other things) has been   removed, for increased compatibility with non-IDN name resolution.  * The fcntl function now have a Long File Support variant named fcntl64.  It   is added to fix some Linux Open File Description (OFD) locks usage on non   LFS mode.  As for others *64 functions, fcntl64 semantics are analogous with   fcntl and LFS support is handled transparently.  Also for Linux, the OFD   locks act as a cancellation entrypoint.  * The obsolete functions encrypt, encrypt_r, setkey, setkey_r, cbc_crypt,   ecb_crypt, and des_setparity are no longer available to newly linked   binaries, and the headers <rpc/des_crypt.h> and <rpc/rpc_des.h> are no   longer installed.  These functions encrypted and decrypted data with the   DES block cipher, which is no longer considered secure.  Software that   still uses these functions should switch to a modern cryptography library,   such as libgcrypt.  * Reflecting the removal of the encrypt and setkey functions above, the   macro _XOPEN_CRYPT is no longer defined.  As a consequence, the crypt   function is no longer declared unless _DEFAULT_SOURCE or _GNU_SOURCE is   enabled.  * The obsolete function fcrypt is no longer available to newly linked   binaries.  It was just another name for the standard function crypt,   and it has not appeared in any header file in many years.  * We have tentative plans to hand off maintenance of the passphrase-hashing   library, libcrypt, to a separate development project that will, we hope,   keep up better with new passphrase-hashing algorithms.  We will continue   to declare 'crypt' in <unistd.h>, and programs that use 'crypt' or   'crypt_r' should not need to change at all; however, distributions will   need to install <crypt.h> and libcrypt from a separate project.    In this release, if the configure option --disable-crypt is used, glibc   will not install <crypt.h> or libcrypt, making room for the separate   project's versions of these files.  The plan is to make this the default   behavior in a future release.  Changes to build and runtime requirements:    GNU make 4.0 or later is now required to build glibc.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2019

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2019

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 297 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2019 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2494878.1).

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from [http://www.java.com/en/](//www.java.com/en/). Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2019verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Oracle E-Business Suite Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 35 new security fixes for the Oracle E-Business Suite.  33 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2019verbose.html#EBS).

Oracle E-Business Suite products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security fixes are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the April 2019 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Oracle E-Business Suite Release 12 Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document (April 2019), [My Oracle Support Note 2514102.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2514102.1).

### Oracle Java SE Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 5 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE.  All of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2019verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application (in Java SE 8) has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

# RHSA-2018:3092 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: glibc security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A3092)

## Topic

An update for glibc is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The glibc packages provide the standard C libraries (libc), POSIX thread libraries (libpthread), standard math libraries (libm), and the name service cache daemon (nscd) used by multiple programs on the system. Without these libraries, the Linux system cannot function correctly.

Security Fix(es):

* glibc: Incorrect handling of RPATH in elf/dl-load.c can be used to execute code loaded from arbitrary libraries (CVE-2017-16997)
* glibc: Integer overflow in posix\_memalign in memalign functions (CVE-2018-6485)
* glibc: Integer overflow in stdlib/canonicalize.c on 32-bit architectures leading to stack-based buffer overflow (CVE-2018-11236)
* glibc: Buffer overflow in \_\_mempcpy\_avx512\_no\_vzeroupper (CVE-2018-11237)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Additional Changes:

For detailed information on changes in this release, see the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 Release Notes linked from the References section.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

For the update to take effect, all services linked to the glibc library must be restarted, or the system rebooted.
