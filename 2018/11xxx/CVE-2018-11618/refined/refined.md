    "RELATED": true,
    "summary": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of the resetForm method. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the application's failure to validate the existence of an object before performing operations on it within the `resetForm` method.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Use-After-Free"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code under the context of the current process.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is remote; an attacker can exploit it by enticing a user to visit a malicious website or open a malicious file.",
