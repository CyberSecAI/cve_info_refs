Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a buffer overflow vulnerability within the EAP-TLS implementation of the `pppd` (Point-to-Point Protocol Daemon). Specifically, the vulnerability arises from a lack of proper input validation in the `eaptls_receive` function within `eap-tls.c`, leading to out-of-bounds reads and writes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The `eaptls_receive` function doesn't check if the length of the received data is sufficient for the operations it performs.
*   **Integer Overflow:** Due to the lack of length checks and how the length parameter is decremented, the length can become negative, leading to `memcpy` being called with a negative length.
*   **Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125):** When the received package is too short, reads are performed at memory locations outside the bounds of the buffer.
*   **Buffer Overread (CWE-126):** Calling `memcpy` with a negative length parameter results in a buffer overread.
*    **Buffer Overflow (CWE-122):** The negative length in `memcpy` can result in writing past the end of the destination buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can cause `pppd` to crash by sending specially crafted network traffic due to the buffer overflow, leading to denial of service
*   **Authentication Bypass (Potential):** The attacker could potentially overwrite server memory structures in such a way that it would change the state of the authentication FSM to a more advanced state, potentially bypassing authentication. This scenario was hypothesized but not fully investigated.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Traffic:** The attack vector is network traffic sent to a vulnerable `pppd` instance. An attacker sends specially crafted packets through the PPP channel, specifically targeting the EAP-TLS protocol implementation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** An attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the target system running `pppd`. This implies the attacker would need to be on the same network as the target system or have a path to route packets to it
*   **EAP-TLS Enabled:** The attacker would need to target systems with EAP-TLS enabled
*  **Understanding of the Protocol:** The attacker would need to have sufficient knowledge of the EAP-TLS protocol to craft malicious packets

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Ivan Gotovchits from Carnegie Mellon University Binary Analysis Team.
*   The vulnerability exists in the EAP-TLS patch of `pppd`.
*   The issue can be triggered even if `pppd` is not configured to use EAP-TLS, as long as the binary is patched with the vulnerable code.
*   A patch has been created to address the vulnerability which includes length checks.
*   The vulnerability was identified using the Memcheck verification tool of the Primus Microexecution Framework.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2018-11574.
