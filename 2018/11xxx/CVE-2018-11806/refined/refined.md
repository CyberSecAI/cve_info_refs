    "description": "A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the SLiRP networking implementation of QEMU. This vulnerability occurs while reassembling fragmented datagrams. A privileged user or process within a guest could exploit this to potentially crash the QEMU process (Denial of Service) or execute arbitrary code on the host.",
