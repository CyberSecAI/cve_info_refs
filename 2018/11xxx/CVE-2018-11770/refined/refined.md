Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-11770:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of authentication on the REST API exposed by the Spark standalone master. This API is used for job submission and is distinct from the `spark-submit` mechanism, which can be configured to use authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authentication:** The standalone master's REST API does not enforce any authentication mechanism, even when `spark.authenticate.secret` is configured for `spark-submit`.
*   **Inadequate Documentation:** The lack of clarity about the REST API's authentication shortcomings contributed to the issue.
*   **Mesos Cluster Mode Vulnerability:** The same unsecured REST API is also used by Mesos when configured to run in cluster mode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Job Submission:** An attacker can submit and run a driver program without authenticating to the standalone master.
*   **Resource Consumption:** While the attacker cannot launch executors using the REST API, the submitted driver program could still consume resources.
*   **Potential Further Exploitation:** If the driver program is crafted maliciously it can cause further impact on the infrastructure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the REST API endpoint of the Spark standalone master (default port 6066). For Mesos it is (port 7077 by default).
*   **REST API Interaction:** The attacker can leverage the unsecured REST API to submit jobs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must have network access to the Spark master's REST API port.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any authentication credentials to submit a driver program via the REST API.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in Spark versions 1.3.0 and later, using standalone master with REST API enabled, or running Mesos master with cluster mode enabled.
*   Mitigation involved disabling the REST API, or restricting network access to the REST API port.
*   Future versions of Spark aimed to improve documentation, disable the REST API by default in the standalone master, and prohibit using `spark.authenticate.secret` when running the REST API.
