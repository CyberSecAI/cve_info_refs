The provided content describes a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability in JerryScript, specifically within the `lit_read_code_unit_from_utf8` function.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap-buffer-overflow occurs when processing a specific regular expression. The issue arises within the `lit_read_code_unit_from_utf8` function, while reading UTF-8 encoded data.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability, which can lead to memory corruption.

- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability can cause a crash (as observed from the AddressSanitizer output), and potentially allow for arbitrary code execution due to memory corruption.

- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by parsing a specially crafted regular expression. Specifically `new RegExp("[\u0020")` triggers the bug.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide malicious javascript code for execution by a vulnerable JerryScript instance.
