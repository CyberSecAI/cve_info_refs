- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Database credentials are stored in plaintext in a configuration file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Plaintext password storage.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated malicious user with access to the configuration file may obtain the exposed password to gain access to the application database.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to have access to the configuration file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an authenticated user with access to the affected system and its configuration files.
