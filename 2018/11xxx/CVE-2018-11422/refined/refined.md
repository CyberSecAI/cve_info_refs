- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Moxa OnCell G3100-HSPA Series devices use a proprietary configuration protocol that lacks confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity controls. All communication is in plain text without authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of encryption for communication, lack of authentication for commands, including firmware and configuration updates, and insecure direct object reference.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can intercept and modify configuration, reboot the device, download or upload configurations, and perform firmware upgrades without any authorization. This allows for complete control over the device.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs network access to the Moxa device, with no authentication requirements.
