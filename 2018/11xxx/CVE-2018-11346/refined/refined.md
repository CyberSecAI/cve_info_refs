{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities including path traversal, unrestricted file upload, insecure direct object reference, and cross-site scripting in various CGI scripts of ASUSTOR ADM.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Path Traversal: Improper validation of user-supplied paths allows access to arbitrary files and directories.",
      "Unrestricted File Upload: Lack of file type and size checks enables uploading malicious code.",
      "Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR): Unprotected access to functions, leading to unintended actions.",
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Insufficient sanitization of user inputs allows injection of malicious scripts.",
        "Insufficient access control leading to low privileged users gaining administrative access."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can achieve arbitrary code execution, information disclosure, and full system compromise through chained exploits.  An attacker can upload and execute arbitrary code, read system files, and create folders in arbitrary locations. Exploiting a combination of these flaws allows unauthenticated or low privileged users to gain administrative level access.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP requests to vulnerable CGI scripts (importuser.cgi, download.cgi, upload.cgi, playlistmanager.cgi, fileExplorer.cgi)",
      "Manipulation of parameters such as 'filename', 'file1', 'act', 'playlist', and 'dest_folder'.",
        "Chaining a stored XSS to steal session cookies to then perform a CSRF attack against other exposed endpoints"
    ],
        "required_capabilities": "An attacker requires either administrative or low level user credentials to exploit these vulnerabilities.  If the cloud service is provisioned on the ASUSTOR NAS, the vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely over the internet."
