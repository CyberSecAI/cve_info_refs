The provided content relates to CVE-2018-11335.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Integer overflow in the `mint` function of the SPX token contract. The `totalSupply` and `balances` variables are vulnerable to integer overflows.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow vulnerability in the `mint` function when adding `value` to `totalSupply` and `balances[holder]`.
- The check `require(totalSupply + value <= TOKEN_LIMIT)` is ineffective due to the integer overflow vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker (contract owner) can bypass the token limit and mint an arbitrary amount of tokens.
- The minted tokens can be arbitrarily retrieved by the contract owner.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to be the contract owner to call the `mint` function.
- The attacker can provide a large `value` argument such that adding it to `totalSupply` will result in an integer overflow, bypassing the `TOKEN_LIMIT`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be the owner of the vulnerable smart contract.
- The attacker must be able to call the vulnerable `mint` function with arbitrary `value` and `holder` parameters.
