- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper file permissions in the default installation of TIA Portal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Insufficient file permissions allow an attacker with local file system access to insert specially crafted files.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Denial-of-service (DoS): Crafted files can prevent TIA Portal startup.
    - Local code execution: Crafted files can lead to local code execution when TIA Portal is launched.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Local file system access is required.
    - The victim needs to attempt to start TIA Portal after the manipulation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Attacker needs local file system access.
    - No special privileges are required.
