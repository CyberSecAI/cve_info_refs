{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper session handling on the /cgi/ folder or /cgi files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Authentication bypass due to missing or incorrect session validation."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can perform various router actions without authentication, including:\n\t- Downloading the router configuration backup file (conf.bin).\n\t- Adding port forwarding rules.\n\t- Rebooting the router.\n\t- Enabling the guest network.\n\t- Enabling or disabling DMZ.\n\t- Changing the WiFi password (but not the admin password).",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a GET or POST request to the /cgi/ folder or specific /cgi files with a specific 'Referer' header.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface (typically on the local network). No prior authentication is required."
