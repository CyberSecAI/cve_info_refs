Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-11363:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `jpeg_size` function within `pdfgen.c` of the PDFGen library. This function is used to determine the size of a JPEG image before embedding it into a PDF document.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Heap-buffer-overflow:** The code attempts to read 4 bytes from the input JPEG data buffer at `data[i]`, `data[i+1]`, `data[i+2]`, and `data[i+3]` to identify the start of the JPEG image. However, there's no proper boundary check to ensure that `i + 3` remains within the bounds of the provided `data_size`. This can cause an out-of-bounds read.
- Specifically, the condition `if (i + 3 < data_size && ...)` is vulnerable since i could be close to data_size and then the code attempts to read beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Crash:** As evidenced by the AddressSanitizer output, the primary impact of exploitation is a program crash due to an out-of-bounds read, leading to denial of service.
- **Potential for arbitrary code execution:** While the immediate impact is a crash, a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability like this can sometimes be leveraged for more serious exploits like arbitrary code execution depending on the memory layout and other factors, but this is not explicitly demonstrated.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Maliciously crafted JPEG image:** An attacker can create a specially crafted JPEG image that, when processed by the vulnerable `jpeg_size` function, will trigger the out-of-bounds read. This image is then passed as an argument to the `pdf_add_jpeg` function, which will call the vulnerable `jpeg_size` function.
- **Input to pdf_add_jpeg:** The attack vector is through the `pdf_add_jpeg` function in `pdfgen.c`. The vulnerable function `jpeg_size` is called when adding a JPEG image.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to provide input to pdfgen:** The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the PDFGen library, specifically the JPEG image that's being embedded into the PDF, which means they should have an input file or program that can use pdfgen to generate PDFs.
- **Basic knowledge of image formats:** Knowledge of JPEG file structure is required to create a malformed image that can trigger the vulnerability.
