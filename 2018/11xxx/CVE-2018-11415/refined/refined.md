```
- Root cause of vulnerability:
    - The application assigns a cookie in the `~session` parameter to unauthenticated users.
    - The `SERVICEUNIQUE` parameter lacks proper validation.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Session Fixation: An attacker can fix the `~session` cookie value via a GET request.
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The lack of validation in the `SERVICEUNIQUE` parameter allows for a reflected XSS vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation:
    - Session fixation allows an attacker to potentially hijack a user's session.
    - XSS allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- Attack vectors:
    - The attacker crafts a malicious URL that includes a fixed `~session` cookie value and a payload in the `SERVICEUNIQUE` parameter.
    - The user is then tricked into clicking this malicious URL.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs with the session fixation and XSS payload.
    - The attacker needs to be able to get the victim to click the URL.
