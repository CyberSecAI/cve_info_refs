MyBiz MyProcureNet is affected by a critical arbitrary file upload vulnerability allowing an attacker to compromise the server by uploading a web shell for issuing OS commands. Furthermore it is affected by cross site scripting issues.

## Vendor Description

*“MyBiz is a company fixated on developing technology which transforms the way business is done online. At the intersection of what one business needs from another is the potential for value to be created differently. This intersection for the exchange of value requires technology but in fundamentally very different ways from traditional enterprise systems. MyBiz believes that the chemistry of business is the business relationships between enterprises. The strength of the business relationship drives the success and future of the business. MyBiz believes that these business relationships need to be captured and orchestrated. MyBiz developed our proprietary Business Relationship Network engine, a platform to capture business relationships as data to drive new business services which create value efficiently.”*

## Business Recommendation

The vendor did not reply to our inquiries since February 2018 hence the issues might still exist in current versions.

SEC Consult recommends not use this product until a thorough security review has been performed by security professionals and all identified issues have been resolved. It is assumed that MyBiz products are affected by further critical security issues.

## Vulnerability Overview/ Description

The identified vulnerabilities can be exploited after authentication but the registration for the application is usually open for anyone.

### 1. Arbitrary File Upload (CVE-2018-11091)

A malicious file can be uploaded to the webserver by an attacker. It is possible for an attacker to upload a script to issue operating system commands.

This vulnerability occurs because an attacker is able to adjust the “HiddenFieldControlCustomWhiteListedExtensions” parameter and add arbitrary extensions to the whitelist during the upload.

For instance, if the extension .asp is added to the “HiddenFieldControlCustomWhiteListedExtensions” parameter, the server accepts “secctest.asp” as legitimate file. Hence malicious files can be uploaded in order to execute arbitrary commands to take over the server.

### 2. Reflected Cross-site scripting (CVE-2018-11090)

This vulnerability within “ProxyPage.aspx” allows an attacker to inject malicious client side scripting which will be executed in the browser of users if they visit the manipulated site.

## Proof Of Concept

The proof of concept has been removed as no patch is available.

## Vulnerable / Tested Versions

MyBiz MyProcureNet version 5.0.0 has been tested and found to be vulnerable. This was the latest version available at the time of the test.

FreeBSD-SA-19:26.mcu                                        Security Advisory
                                                          The FreeBSD Project

Topic:          Intel CPU Microcode Update

Category:       3rd party
Module:         Intel CPU microcode
Announced:      2019-11-12
Credits:        Intel
Affects:        All supported versions of FreeBSD running on certain
                Intel CPUs.
CVE Name:       CVE-2019-11135, CVE-2019-11139, CVE-2018-12126,
                CVE-2018-12127, CVE-2018-12130, CVE-2018-11091,
                CVE-2017-5715

For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit <URL:<https://security.FreeBSD.org/>>.

I.   Background

- From time to time Intel releases new CPU microcode to address functional
issues and security vulnerabilities.  Such a release is also known as a
Micro Code Update (MCU), and is a component of a broader Intel Platform
Update (IPU).  FreeBSD distributes CPU microcode via the devcpu-data port
and package.

II.  Problem Description

Starting with version 1.26, the devcpu-data port/package includes updates and
mitigations for the following technical and security advisories (depending
on CPU model).

Intel TSX Updates (TAA)                 CVE-2019-11135
Voltage Modulation Vulnerability        CVE-2019-11139
MD_CLEAR Operations                     CVE-2018-12126
                                        CVE-2018-12127
                                        CVE-2018-12130
                                        CVE-2018-11091
TA Indirect Sharing                     CVE-2017-5715
EGETKEY                                 CVE-2018-12126
                                        CVE-2018-12127
                                        CVE-2018-12130
                                        CVE-2018-11091
JCC                                     SKX102 Erratum

Updated microcode includes mitigations for CPU issues, but may also cause a
performance regression due to the JCC erratum mitigation.  Please visit
<http://www.intel.com/benchmarks> for further information.

Please visit <http://www.intel.com/security> for detailed information on
these advisories as well as a list of CPUs that are affected.

III. Impact

Operating a CPU without the latest microcode may result in erratic or
unpredictable behavior, including system crashes and lock ups.  Certain
issues listed in this advisory may result in the leakage of privileged
system information to unprivileged users.  Please refer to the security
advisories listed above for detailed information.

IV.  Workaround

To determine if TSX is present in your system, run the following:

1. kldload cpuctl

2. cpucontrol -i 7 /dev/cpuctl0

If bits 4 (0x10) and 11 (0x800) are set in the second response word (EBX),
TSX is present.

In the absence of updated microcode, TAA can be mitigated by enabling the
MDS mitigation:

3. sysctl hw.mds_disable=1

Systems must be running FreeBSD 11.3, FreeBSD 12.1, or later for this to
work.

*IMPORTANT*
If your use case can tolerate leaving the CPU issues unmitigated and cannot
tolerate a performance regression, ensure that the devcpu-data package is
not installed or is locked at 1.25 or earlier.

# pkg delete devcpu-data

or

# pkg lock devcpu-data

Later versions of the LLVM and GCC compilers will include changes that
partially relieve the peformance impact.

V.   Solution

Install the latest Intel Microcode Update via the devcpu-data port/package,
version 1.26 or later.

Updated microcode adds the ability to disable TSX.  With updated microcode
the issue can still be mitigated by enabling the MDS mitigation as
described in the workaround section, or by disabling TSX instead:

1. kldload cpuctl

2. cpucontrol -i 7 /dev/cpuctl0

If bit 29 (0x20000000) is set in the fourth response word (EDX), then the
0x10a MSR is present.

3. cpucontrol -m 0x10a /dev/cpuctl0

If bit 8 (0x100) of the response word is set, your CPU is not vulnerable to
TAA and no further action is required.

If bit 7 (0x80) is cleared, then your CPU does not have updated microcode
that facilitates TSX to be disabled.  The only remedy available is to
enable the MDS mitigation, as documented above.

4. cpucontrol -m 0x122=3 /dev/cpuctl0

Repeat step 4 for each numbered CPU that is present.

A future kernel change to FreeBSD will provide automatic detection and
mitigation for TAA.

LLVM 9.0 will be updated in FreeBSD 13-current to address the JCC
peformance impact.  Updates to prior versions of LLVM are currently being
evaluated.

VI.  Correction details

There are currently no changes in FreeBSD to address this issue.

Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor did not reply to our inquiries since February 2018 hence the issues
might still exist in current versions.

SEC Consult recommends not use this product until a thorough security review
has been performed by security professionals and all identified issues have
been resolved. It is assumed that MyBiz products are affected by further
critical security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
The identified vulnerabilities can be exploited after authentication but
the registration for the application is usually open for anyone.

1. Arbitrary File Upload
A malicious file can be uploaded to the webserver by an attacker. It is
possible for an attacker to upload a script to issue operating system
commands.

This vulnerability occurs because an attacker is able to adjust the
"HiddenFieldControlCustomWhiteListedExtensions" parameter and add arbitrary
extensions to the whitelist during the upload.

For instance, if the extension .asp is added to the
"HiddenFieldControlCustomWhiteListedExtensions" parameter, the server
accepts "secctest.asp" as legitimate file. Hence malicious files can be
uploaded in order to execute arbitrary commands to take over the server.

I. Background
- From time to time Intel releases new CPU microcode to address functional
issues and security vulnerabilities. Such a release is also known as a
Micro Code Update (MCU), and is a component of a broader Intel Platform
Update (IPU). FreeBSD distributes CPU microcode via the devcpu-data port
and package.
II. Problem Description
Starting with version 1.26, the devcpu-data port/package includes updates and
mitigations for the following technical and security advisories (depending
on CPU model).
Intel TSX Updates (TAA) CVE-2019-11135
Voltage Modulation Vulnerability CVE-2019-11139
MD\_CLEAR Operations CVE-2018-12126
CVE-2018-12127
CVE-2018-12130
CVE-2018-11091
TA Indirect Sharing CVE-2017-5715
EGETKEY CVE-2018-12126
CVE-2018-12127
CVE-2018-12130
CVE-2018-11091
JCC SKX102 Erratum
Updated microcode includes mitigations for CPU issues, but may also cause a
performance regression due to the JCC erratum mitigation. Please visit
http://www.intel.com/benchmarks for further information.
Please visit http://www.intel.com/security for detailed information on
these advisories as well as a list of CPUs that are affected.
III. Impact
Operating a CPU without the latest microcode may result in erratic or
unpredictable behavior, including system crashes and lock ups. Certain
issues listed in this advisory may result in the leakage of privileged
system information to unprivileged users. Please refer to the security
advisories listed above for detailed information.
IV. Workaround
To determine if TSX is present in your system, run the following:
1. kldload cpuctl
2. cpucontrol -i 7 /dev/cpuctl0
If bits 4 (0x10) and 11 (0x800) are set in the second response word (EBX),
TSX is present.
In the absence of updated microcode, TAA can be mitigated by enabling the
MDS mitigation:
3. sysctl hw.mds\_disable=1
Systems must be running FreeBSD 11.3, FreeBSD 12.1, or later for this to
work.
\*IMPORTANT\*
If your use case can tolerate leaving the CPU issues unmitigated and cannot
tolerate a performance regression, ensure that the devcpu-data package is
not installed or is locked at 1.25 or earlier.
# pkg delete devcpu-data
or
# pkg lock devcpu-data
Later versions of the LLVM and GCC compilers will include changes that
partially relieve the peformance impact.
V. Solution
Install the latest Intel Microcode Update via the devcpu-data port/package,
version 1.26 or later.
Updated microcode adds the ability to disable TSX. With updated microcode
the issue can still be mitigated by enabling the MDS mitigation as
described in the workaround section, or by disabling TSX instead:
1. kldload cpuctl
2. cpucontrol -i 7 /dev/cpuctl0
If bit 29 (0x20000000) is set in the fourth response word (EDX), then the
0x10a MSR is present.
3. cpucontrol -m 0x10a /dev/cpuctl0
If bit 8 (0x100) of the response word is set, your CPU is not vulnerable to
TAA and no further action is required.
If bit 7 (0x80) is cleared, then your CPU does not have updated microcode
that facilitates TSX to be disabled. The only remedy available is to
enable the MDS mitigation, as documented above.
4. cpucontrol -m 0x122=3 /dev/cpuctl0
Repeat step 4 for each numbered CPU that is present.
A future kernel change to FreeBSD will provide automatic detection and
mitigation for TAA.
LLVM 9.0 will be updated in FreeBSD 13-current to address the JCC
peformance impact. Updates to prior versions of LLVM are currently being
evaluated.
VI. Correction details
There are currently no changes in FreeBSD to address this issue.
