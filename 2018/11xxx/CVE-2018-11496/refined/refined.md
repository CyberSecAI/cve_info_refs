Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-11496

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap-use-after-free that occurs due to a double free in the `read_stream` function. The `s->buf` pointer is freed in `fill_buffer` (stream.c:1573), but then the same freed pointer is accessed in `memcpy` within the `read_stream` function at (stream.c:1756). Then `fill_buffer` is called again which attempts to free already freed memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap-use-after-free
- Double free

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service (crashes due to double free or memory corruption).
- Potential for other unspecified impacts due to memory corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted lrzip archive file (`.lrz`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted `.lrz` file that triggers the vulnerable code path in `lrzip`.
- The attacker doesn't need to be local.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided ASAN backtrace shows the exact location of the use-after-free and where the memory was freed previously.
- The `lrzip-uaf-read_stream.lrz.zip` file was attached to the issue report as proof of concept.

The Debian security advisory confirms the vulnerability is related to `lrzip`, and includes CVE-2018-11496 in the list of vulnerabilities addressed in the update. The advisory also states that the vulnerability could lead to denial of service or unspecified impact.
