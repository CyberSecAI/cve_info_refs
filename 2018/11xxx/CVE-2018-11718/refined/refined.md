- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The PC-series sensor firmware authenticates users in a way that makes CSRF requests possible.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized actions on the sensor. The provided CVSS score indicates high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks through CSRF requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to trick a user with valid credentials into initiating a request. If default credentials are changed, the attacker must also know a valid password.
