The provided content relates to CVE-2018-11226.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `getString` function within `decompile.c`. Specifically, when handling `PUSH_INT` cases, a fixed-size buffer of 10 bytes is allocated for the string representation of an integer using `malloc(10)`. However, if the integer value, when converted to a string using `sprintf`, requires more than 10 bytes (including the null terminator), a buffer overflow will occur.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The `sprintf` function writes the string representation of the integer into a fixed-size buffer without checking if it can hold the entire string.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Program termination (crash):** The immediate impact is a crash, as demonstrated by the SIGABRT signal and the "buffer overflow detected" message.
- **Potential for arbitrary code execution:** In more severe scenarios, buffer overflows can allow attackers to overwrite adjacent memory locations. This could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if the attacker has precise control over the overflow.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious SWF file:** The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specifically crafted SWF file. The file has to contain a PUSH_INT operation that pushes an integer whose string representation is longer than 9 characters.
- **File parsing:** The vulnerability exists within the decompilation part of the software, which is triggered when the software attempts to interpret and decompile the SWF bytecode.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the SWF file as input to the vulnerable software.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges.
