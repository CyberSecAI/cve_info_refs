{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `buffer_addraw` function in `buffer.c` within Libmobi 0.3 has a heap-based buffer over-read.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer over-read"
    ],
    "impact": "Information disclosure. An attacker can potentially read data from memory beyond the allocated buffer, which can leak sensitive information. In the provided context, it does not lead to arbitrary code execution, only information disclosure.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted MOBI file. The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted MOBI file."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted MOBI file that will be processed by the vulnerable `libmobi` library. No special privileges or specific network access is required; exploitation requires access to the vulnerable file parsing function"
  }
