Specifically, in the Enterprise Manager risk matrix, it is noted that:
> The patch for CVE-2018-11058 also addresses CVE-2016-0701, CVE-2016-2183, CVE-2016-6306, CVE-2016-8610, CVE-2018-11054, CVE-2018-11055, CVE-2018-11056, CVE-2018-11057 and CVE-2018-15769.

and in the JD Edwards risk matrix, it is noted that:
> The patch for CVE-2018-11058 also addresses CVE-2016-0701, CVE-2016-2183, CVE-2016-6306, CVE-2016-8610, CVE-2018-11054, CVE-2018-11055, CVE-2018-11056, CVE-2018-11057 and CVE-2018-15769.

The content also links CVE-2018-11057 to an advisory from Dell, which lists it as related to  RSA BSAFE Micro Edition Suite, referencing a "Buffer over-read" vulnerability when parsing ASN.1 data.

**2. Root Cause of the Vulnerability:**

The root cause, as described in the Dell advisory, is a **Buffer Over-Read** vulnerability in the RSA BSAFE Micro Edition Suite and Crypto-C Micro Edition when parsing ASN.1 data. This suggests a flaw in how the software handles the input length or structure during ASN.1 parsing, leading to a potential read out-of-bounds.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Over-Read:** The vulnerability lies in the software's inability to correctly handle ASN.1 data during parsing, leading to an attempt to read past the allocated buffer.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A remote attacker could potentially cause a DoS, by providing malicious crafted ASN.1 data.
*   **Information Disclosure:** A remote attacker could use maliciously crafted ASN.1 data that would result in a buffer over-read.
*   **Information Disclosure (RSA Key):** A remote attacker may be able to recover an RSA key.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be triggered by providing malicious ASN.1 data over a network. The Dell advisory specifically mentions "maliciously constructed ASN.1 data" being used by a "remote attacker".

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** An attacker needs to be able to send crafted ASN.1 data to the vulnerable system.
*   **No Authentication:** In several cases the vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable without requiring user credentials, as noted in the Oracle risk matrices. This means an attacker doesn't need to authenticate to exploit them.
*   **Knowledge of ASN.1:** The attacker must understand the ASN.1 data structures and be able to craft malicious data to exploit the buffer over-read vulnerability.

**7. Additional Notes:**

*   The Oracle advisories confirm that multiple products are affected by the vulnerability, including Oracle Real User Experience Insight, JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Tools, Oracle VM VirtualBox and Oracle Secure Backup.
* The Dell advisory specifies that the issues are resolved in RSA BSAFE Crypto-C Micro Edition version 4.0.5.3, RSA BSAFE Micro Edition Suite version 4.0.11, and RSA BSAFE Micro Edition Suite version 4.1.6.1

**Summary:**

CVE-2018-11057 involves a buffer over-read vulnerability in RSA BSAFE Micro Edition Suite when parsing ASN.1 data. It can lead to DoS and Information Disclosure. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing specially crafted ASN.1 data to affected Oracle products or to affected software using the RSA BSAFE libraries. This CVE is listed as addressed in the April 2020 CPU. The Oracle and Dell documentation identifies a number of Oracle products that require patching to mitigate this vulnerability.
