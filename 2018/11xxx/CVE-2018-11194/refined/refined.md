  "vulnerability_information": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to improper neutralization of special elements used in OS commands (CWE-78). Multiple parameters across different functionalities of the Quest DR Series Disk Backup software's web interface are not properly sanitized before being used in OS commands.",

      "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command [CWE-78]",

        "Unauthenticated command injection via the 'Password' parameter in the 'Logon' method.",

Some command injection vulnerabilities require a valid authentication token, which can be obtained through the unauthenticated command injection vulnerability. For privilege escalation, successful exploitation of a command injection vulnerability that gives the attacker access as the web server user (webadmin) is required."
