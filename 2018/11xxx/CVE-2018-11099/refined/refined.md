Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-11099:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the `header::add_INFO_descriptor` function within `header.cpp`. This function has unsafe memory handling that leads to a heap-based buffer over-read during parsing of crafted VCF files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-based Buffer Over-read:** The `header::add_INFO_descriptor` function attempts to read beyond the allocated buffer on the heap. Specifically when parsing the meta information in a crafted VCF file, an out-of-bounds read occurs due to incorrect handling of input strings within the `str2int` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The heap-based buffer over-read can lead to the disclosure of sensitive data from the heap memory.
*   **Denial of Service (Crash):** The out-of-bounds read causes the program to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted VCF File:** The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted VCF file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Interaction:** An attacker needs to trick a user into processing a malicious VCF file using `vcftools`.
*   **Remote Attack:** The attacker can achieve this by sending a user the crafted VCF file (e.g. via email) or hosting it on a website for download.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `header.cpp` file within the `vcftools` source code.
*   The vulnerability affects version 0.1.15 of vcftools.
*   The `header::tokenize` function, called from within `add_INFO_descriptor` is identified as the source of the vulnerability in the use after free issues of the other two CVEs.
*   The vulnerability is fixed by introducing additional checks on input and token lengths, which also address other related CVEs.
