Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-11240:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of restrictions on the `exec command` feature within the T-Router protocol of SoftCase T-Router devices.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unrestricted Command Execution:** The primary weakness is the absence of access controls or input sanitization on the `exec command`. This allows for arbitrary command execution on both the remote modem and the main servers.
- **Insecure Permissions:** The gist file explicitly identifies the vulnerability type as "Insecure Permissions."

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable devices, including both the modems and the main servers.
- **Escalation of Privileges:** The vulnerability also leads to privilege escalation as the attacker gains control over the device through command execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending specifically crafted packets using the T-Router protocol.
- **Network Component:** The attack vector targets the T-Router network component.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable device.
- **Encryption Key:** The attacker needs to possess the encryption key used by the device, which they can extract from the device itself.
- **Crafted Packets:** The attacker needs to craft packets with the `exec command` and send them to the device.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered in January 2018 and reported to the vendor, SoftCase.
- The issue was fixed in production builds by April 2018.
- The vulnerability is specific to SoftCase T-Router devices, particularly the Linux T-Router build 20112017.
- The discoverers of the vulnerability are Leonid Krolle and George Zaytsev from Positive Technologies.
