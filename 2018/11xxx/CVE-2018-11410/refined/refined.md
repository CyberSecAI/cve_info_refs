Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-11410:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by an "invalid free" operation within the `compileRule` function located in the `compileTranslationTable.c` file of the Liblouis library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Invalid Free:** The code attempts to free memory that is not valid for deallocation. This can happen due to incorrect memory management within the `compileRule` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  An attacker could exploit this invalid free to crash the application, leading to a denial-of-service condition. This is confirmed by the crash reports and backtraces provided in the Red Hat bugzilla entry.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously crafted table files:** The vulnerability is triggered when Liblouis processes specially crafted braille translation table files. An attacker can supply such a malformed table file to an application using liblouis. This could be achieved via an application that uses liblouis to process user provided or downloaded files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to provide input files:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious braille table file as input to a program using Liblouis. This may require some level of control over the input data of a vulnerable application.
