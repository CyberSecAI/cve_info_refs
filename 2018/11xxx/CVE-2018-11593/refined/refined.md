The provided content is related to CVE-2018-11593.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A stack buffer overflow occurs in the `jsvStringIteratorPrintfCallback` function within `src/jsvar.c`, specifically when handling exceptions during parsing.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when writing to the `gotStr` buffer within the `jslMatch` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Program crash (abort) due to the stack buffer overflow as reported by AddressSanitizer.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution if an attacker can carefully craft input to control the overflowed data and overwrite return addresses or other critical data on the stack.

**Attack vectors:**
- Input that triggers an exception during parsing can trigger the overflow.
- The issue is triggered via the `jslMatch` function, which is part of the lexical analysis of the input JavaScript code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker must be able to provide crafted input that triggers an exception during lexical analysis (`jslMatch`).
- No special privileges or specific system access are required, other than the ability to provide input to the affected program.

**Additional details:**

- The commit `bed844f109b6c222816740555068de2e101e8018` addresses the vulnerability by replacing `strncpy` with `strcpy`. The commit message mentions "remove strncpy usage as it's effectively useless, replace with an assertion since fn is only used internally".
- The provided issue #1426 includes a stack trace from the AddressSanitizer. The trace shows the overflow occurring when writing to the `gotStr` buffer in `jslMatch`. The size of `gotStr` is 32 bytes as shown in the issue report.
- Sample input files `eh_0.txt` and `eh_1.txt` are mentioned to reproduce the overflow, but were not included in the provided content.
