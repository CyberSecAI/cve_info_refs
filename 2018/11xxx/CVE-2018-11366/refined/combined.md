The idea of this plugin is good, the simpleness was great, but if it for the compatibility to other plug in, then you must be mindful and careful. I had already use the plugin with the pro version, but when I use it with Elementor, Woocommerce, there are some error to my website because of the change url or slug of the url. I hope in the future there will be more compatible to other plug-in, at least for plug-in that most used.
