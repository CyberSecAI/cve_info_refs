The provided content relates to CVE-2018-11366.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input within the Loginizer plugin. Specifically, the code used `addslashes` on `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']` which is then directly inserted into a database query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is an XSS issue where an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code through the `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']` parameter. This occurs because the plugin was not properly sanitizing or escaping this user-controlled data before using it in a SQL query which then outputs the data into the plugin.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session. This could lead to various malicious actions such as:
    - Stealing cookies and session tokens.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the logged-in user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']` parameter, which is part of the HTTP request. An attacker could craft a malicious URL, potentially through a phishing email or a crafted link, which would cause the injected XSS payload to execute when the vulnerable code is accessed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make a request to the vulnerable page of the WordPress site. No authentication is required for the initial exploitation of the reflected XSS, however the attacker may need an authenticated session to use stored XSS.
