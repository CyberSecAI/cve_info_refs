The provided content is related to CVE-2018-11324.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A race condition exists in the session deletion process. A long-running background process could interfere with the destruction of a user session, causing it to be recreated instead of being properly terminated.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Session race condition leading to unexpected session recreation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  A session that was expected to be destroyed could be unexpectedly recreated due to the race condition. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access or other security issues depending on the application logic and session data.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering a long-running background process while simultaneously attempting to destroy a user session.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to trigger a long-running background process, such as remote checks for core or extension updates.
- Ability to initiate the destruction of a user session (e.g., logging out) during the execution of a long-running process.
