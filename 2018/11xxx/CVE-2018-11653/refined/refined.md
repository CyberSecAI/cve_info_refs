Based on the provided content, here's the information related to CVE-2018-11653:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an information disclosure issue in Netwave IP cameras. Specifically, the file `//etc/RT2870STA.dat` is accessible without authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unauthenticated access to sensitive configuration file: The file `//etc/RT2870STA.dat`, which contains sensitive network configuration information, is accessible without any form of authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exfiltrate sensitive network configuration data, including network SSID and password. This can lead to unauthorized access to the network the camera is connected to, or further exploitation of the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unauthenticated Network Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending an unauthenticated HTTP request to retrieve the `//etc/RT2870STA.dat` file from the affected IP camera.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target IP camera. This could be from the same local network or, potentially, from the internet if the camera is exposed.
- **No authentication required:** The attacker doesn't need any credentials or authentication to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The content references Shodan as a resource to find potentially vulnerable targets.
- The information includes a direct path of the vulnerable file `//etc/RT2870STA.dat`.
- The vulnerability could potentially allow further network exploitation, depending on the network setup.
