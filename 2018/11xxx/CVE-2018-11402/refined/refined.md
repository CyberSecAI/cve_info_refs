Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2018-11402:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The SimpliSafe Original Home Security System uses unencrypted radio frequency (RF) transmissions between the Keypad/Keychain Remote/Sensors and the Base Station. This allows an attacker to capture and replay these transmissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Unencrypted RF transmissions:** The system transmits commands like ARM, DISARM, PIN codes, and sensor status in cleartext over the 433 MHz band.
*   **Lack of replay protection:** The system does not use rolling codes, nonces, two-way handshakes, or other techniques to prevent replay attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can bypass the authentication by replaying captured commands, effectively controlling the alarm system (arming, disarming, triggering panic alarms) without knowing the PIN.
*   **System Compromise:** By replaying the disarm command, an attacker can disable the alarm system at a time of their choosing, making the premises vulnerable to unauthorized access.
*   **Read and Write Access:** Attackers can read (decode) and write (replay) transmitted packets which includes sensitive information like PIN sequences, serial numbers of keypads and sensors, and status information.
*   **Service Interruption:** Though not the primary impact described for this specific CVE, the advisory mentions RF interference (covered under CVE-2018-11401) can also disable the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Wireless Capture and Replay:** The primary attack vector involves intercepting RF communications between system components (Keypad/Keychain Remote/Sensors to Base Station) using a software-defined radio (SDR) dongle and replaying the captured transmissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Physical Proximity:** Attackers must be within radio range (15-30 meters) of the target system.
*   **Technical Skills:**  Attackers need knowledge of radio frequency communications and the ability to use an SDR and publicly available code (like rtl_433).
*   **Equipment:**  Attackers require low-cost equipment such as an SDR dongle.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory explicitly states that the vulnerabilities described do not affect the "All New SimpliSafe Home Security System" (released in January 2018) or SimpliCam security cameras.
*   SimpliSafe acknowledges that while no new vulnerabilities were found by Mr.Callis, the original vulnerabilities become more practical to exploit as time goes on due to the increasing accessibility of the required tools.
*   SimpliSafe considers CVE-2018-11399 and CVE-2018-11402 to be related to the same exposure, but no details are provided as to how they are distinct.
