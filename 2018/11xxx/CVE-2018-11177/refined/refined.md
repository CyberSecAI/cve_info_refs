{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input when constructing command line strings, leading to command injection vulnerabilities. Several functionalities within the Quest DR Series Disk Backup software are affected by this, including those related to user management, container operations, scheduling, licensing, email relay, Active Directory integration, storage management, diagnostics, replication, hostname configuration, email alerts, network traffic control, encryption settings, startup configurations, cloud and customer portal registration, DNS settings, support portal registration, date and time settings, and global view functionalities.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command [CWE-78]",
      "Execution with Unnecessary Privileges [CWE-250]"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary system commands on the appliance with root permissions.",
    "attack_vectors": "Attackers can exploit the vulnerable JSON-RPC API of the Quest DR Series Disk Backup software by sending crafted requests with malicious payloads injected into various parameters.  This can be achieved both remotely without authentication (in the case of the Logon method) and with valid authentication tokens via other vulnerable methods.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the appliance's web interface. For the unauthenticated command injection, no prior authentication is needed. For the other command injection vulnerabilities, a valid authentication token is needed."
