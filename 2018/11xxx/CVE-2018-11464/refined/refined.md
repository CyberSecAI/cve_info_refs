- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The integrated VNC server on port 5900/tcp of the affected products is vulnerable to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A vulnerability in the VNC server allows a remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can compromise the availability of the VNC server, rendering it unusable.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending specially crafted network requests to the affected devices on port 5900/tcp.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires network access to the affected devices on port 5900/tcp. No user privileges are required and no user interaction is needed for successful exploitation. The advisory also notes that port 5900/tcp must be manually opened in the firewall configuration of network port X130 for this vulnerability to be exploitable.
