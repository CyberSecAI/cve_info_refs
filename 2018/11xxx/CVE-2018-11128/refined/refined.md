- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack buffer overflow occurs in the `ObjReader::ReadObj()` function when parsing a crafted PDF file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack buffer overflow vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs by providing a crafted PDF file to the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted PDF file to the vulnerable application.
