The provided content describes two heap buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the `md4c` library.

**1. Heap buffer overflow in `md_split_simple_pairing_mark()`:**

*   **Root cause:** A heap buffer overflow occurs in the `memcpy` function within the `md_split_simple_pairing_mark` function.
*   **Vulnerability:** The `memcpy` attempts to copy data of size `sizeof(MD_MARK)` (20 bytes) into a `dummy` buffer, which is too small, leading to a heap buffer overflow.
*   **Impact:** This can lead to denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack vector:** By crafting a specific markdown file that triggers the vulnerable code path in `md_split_simple_pairing_mark`.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a markdown file to be processed by the `md4c` library via the `md2html` tool.

**2. Heap buffer overflow in `md_process_inlines()`:**

*   **Root cause:** A heap buffer overflow occurs during the processing of inline elements in the `md_process_inlines()` function.
*   **Vulnerability:** The `mark` variable accesses a restricted area of memory due to an incorrect loop condition `while(!(mark->flags & MD_MARK_RESOLVED) || mark->beg < off)`. This leads to out-of-bounds read access during the evaluation of `mark->flags` or `mark->beg`.
*   **Impact:** This can lead to denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution due to the out-of-bounds read.
*   **Attack vector:** By crafting a specific markdown file that triggers the vulnerable code path in `md_process_inlines`.
*  **Attacker capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a markdown file to be processed by the `md4c` library via the `md2html` tool.
