{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (CWE-78). User-supplied input is used to construct shell commands without proper sanitization, leading to command injection vulnerabilities.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Multiple command injection vulnerabilities via the JSON-RPC API in various methods and parameters.",
    "Privilege escalation vulnerabilities due to the web server user (webadmin) having sudo access to multiple binaries/scripts, allowing escalation to root.",
    "Unauthenticated command injection via the 'Logon' method's 'Password' parameter."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution with root privileges on the affected Quest DR Series Disk Backup appliance.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP requests to the appliance's JSON-RPC API.  Unauthenticated access possible via the login functionality. Authenticated attacks possible via various API endpoints.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
    "For unauthenticated command injection: Network access to the appliance's web interface.",
    "For authenticated command injection: Valid session cookie and network access to the web interface.",
    "For privilege escalation: Initial code execution achieved via any command injection vulnerability."
