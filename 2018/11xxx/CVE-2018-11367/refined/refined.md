- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A security bug in the JSON parser module of CppCMS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The JSON parser module had a vulnerability that could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit would cause a denial-of-service, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
- **Attack vectors:** The specific attack vector is not detailed, but it is within the JSON parser module, so a crafted JSON input is the likely vector.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need the ability to send a crafted JSON payload to the application.
