{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The NEC Univerge WebPro application uses predictable session IDs and stores user passwords in cleartext.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Predictable session IDs can be guessed by attackers.",
      "Storing passwords in cleartext allows direct access to user credentials upon successful exploitation."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can obtain sensitive user account information, including cleartext passwords, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control of the telephone system.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is remote, by sending HTTP requests to the target system.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable NEC system. No prior authentication is needed. The attacker must send repeated HTTP requests, incrementing the session ID value in the request until a valid session ID is found.  A valid session ID combined with a specific URI will then expose the stored credentials."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "affected_product": "NEC Univerge Sv9100 WebPro version 6.00.00",
     "shodan_search": "The Shodan search query 'Server Henry' reveals many internet-facing instances of the vulnerable software.",
    "poc_details": "A proof-of-concept Python script is provided that demonstrates the vulnerability by making HTTP requests and testing different session IDs. The script will print exposed accounts and store them in a text file when a valid session is found.",
    "disclosure_timeline": "The vulnerability was disclosed to the vendor, but they did not reply. Mitre assigned CVE numbers on June 5, 2018. JPCERT notified NEC on June 7, 2018. After repeated attempts, the vendor requested a public disclosure after December 1, 2018. The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on December 2, 2018."
