- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by the ability of a local attacker to use ioctl calls to perform out-of-bounds reads, arbitrary writes, or execute code in kernel mode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read, arbitrary write, and code execution in kernel mode.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to a compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the affected systems.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access and user privileges but no user interaction is required.
