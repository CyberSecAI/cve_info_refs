  "CVE-2018-11510": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Unauthenticated OS command injection in the 'script' parameter of the `/portal/apis/aggrecate_js.cgi` file.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "OS command injection due to insufficient sanitization of user input.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution as root user, leading to complete compromise of the appliance.",
      "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `/portal/apis/aggrecate_js.cgi` with a malicious `script` parameter.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable device. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability due to improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The application fails to sanitize user input after the cgi file executes a call to a local shell script, allowing execution of arbitrary OS commands.",
       "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution on the host operating system as the root user, resulting in a complete compromise of the appliance.",
      "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `/portal/apis/aggrecate_js.cgi` with a malicious `script` parameter.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability."
