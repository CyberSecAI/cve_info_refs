Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
*   The root cause is a path traversal vulnerability in the RSA Certificate Manager. This vulnerability exists in the RSA CMP Enroll Server and the RSA REST Enroll Server components.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Path Traversal:** The vulnerability stems from improper handling of input parameters, allowing attackers to manipulate file paths.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by remote, unauthenticated attackers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized File Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain unauthorized read access to files stored on the server's filesystem.
*   **Compromise System:** The vulnerability could potentially be exploited by malicious users to compromise the affected system

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
*   **Manipulated Input Parameters:** Attackers manipulate input parameters to achieve path traversal.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable service.

**Affected Products:**

*   RSA Certificate Manager versions 6.9 build 560 through 6.9 build 564

**Resolution:**
*  Upgrade to RSA Certificate Manager version 6.9 build 565 or later.
