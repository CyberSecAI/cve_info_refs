DSA-2018-122: RSA Certificate Manager Path Traversal Vulnerability

Dell EMC Identifier: DSA-2018-122

CVE Identifier: CVE-2018-11051

Severity: High

Severity Rating: CVSS v3 Base Score: 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

Affected Products:

RSA Certificate Manager Versions 6.9 build 560 through 6.9 build 564

Summary:

RSA Certificate Manager 6.9 contains a fix for a path traversal vulnerability that could potentially be exploited by
malicious users to compromise the affected system.

Details:

RSA Certificate Manager Versions 6.9 build 560 through 6.9 build 564 contain a path traversal vulnerability in the RSA
CMP Enroll Server and the RSA REST Enroll Server. A remote unauthenticated attacker could potentially exploit this
vulnerability by manipulating input parameters of the application to gain unauthorized read access to the files stored
on the server filesystem, with the privileges of the running web application.

The following product versions contain resolutions to these issues:
*             RSA Certificate Manager version 6.9 build 565 or later

RSA recommends all customers upgrade at the earliest opportunity. Customers should follow security best practices to
password protect CA and SSL keys, and to encrypt passwords in RSA Certificate Manager configuration files using
ppencryption tool.
