```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application lacks proper CSRF protection. It does not validate the origin of requests before processing them, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of a legitimate user.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can perform actions on the application as a logged-in user. This could include modifying quotations, creating admin users, or other administrative actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that sends a request to the vulnerable application. When a logged-in user visits the malicious page, the browser automatically sends the crafted request to the application, causing it to execute the attacker's intended action.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to lure a logged-in user to visit a malicious website controlled by the attacker. The attacker does not need to know the user's credentials."
