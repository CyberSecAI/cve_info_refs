- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A specially crafted authentication request sent to the affected systems.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper authentication handling allows for privilege escalation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can escalate their privileges to an elevated user account (but not root), leading to potential compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access to the affected systems.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access and does not require any user privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability.
