The provided content is related to CVE-2018-11546.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Heap buffer overflow in the `md_is_named_entity_contents` function within the `md4c` library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
A heap buffer overflow occurs due to an out-of-bounds read in the `md_is_named_entity_contents` function. This function is responsible for parsing named HTML entities, and the vulnerability is triggered during the processing of a crafted input string containing a specific entity.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The heap buffer overflow could lead to a crash (as demonstrated in the provided AddressSanitizer output), denial of service, or potentially allow for arbitrary code execution if exploited maliciously.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted markdown input file to the `md2html` tool (or any other tool using the affected `md4c` library).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted markdown file to be processed by the vulnerable `md4c` library. This could be achieved through various means, depending on the context in which the library is used (e.g., processing user-provided markdown content on a web server).
