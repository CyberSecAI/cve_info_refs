{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Roku External Control API, which allows control over basic functionality of the device, lacks authentication and is accessible over the local network.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of authentication on the local API.",
      "Exposure of sensitive functionalities through the API (e.g., launching apps, sensor data, key presses).",
      "Reliance on the assumption that devices on the same network are trusted."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can gain unauthorized control over the Roku device, including: control of buttons and key presses, access to sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer), search content, and launch apps.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "DNS rebinding attack to bypass network firewalls.",
       "User is tricked into visiting a malicious website that initiates the DNS rebinding attack."
    ],
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious website that performs DNS rebinding to redirect browser requests to the target Roku device on the local network. They don't need to be on the same network as the target."
