- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A client query could cause the server to attempt to reply with the invalid revision number constant `SVN_INVALID_REVNUM`, triggering an assertion failure in the serialization layer. This happens when using the `get-deleted-rev` command in the svn protocol.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The server-side code doesn't properly handle the case where `svn_repos_deleted_rev` returns `SVN_INVALID_REVNUM`, leading to an assertion failure when serializing the response.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation results in a denial of service by crashing the `svnserve` process.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious client can send a crafted request using the `get-deleted-rev` command that results in the server attempting to return `SVN_INVALID_REVNUM`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the `svnserve` server using the svn protocol, and needs to know a path that will cause the `svn_repos_deleted_rev` function to return `SVN_INVALID_REVNUM`. This is a read-only request, so no authentication is required by the vulnerability itself. The attacker needs to be able to send a command to the server that triggers the vulnerable code path.
