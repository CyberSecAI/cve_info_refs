Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-11526:

**Verification:**

The content directly references CVE-2018-11526 and provides information about a CSV Injection vulnerability in the "WordPress Comments Import & Export" plugin. Therefore, the content is related to the specified CVE.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the WordPress Comments Import & Export plugin, specifically in versions prior to 2.0.5. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of arbitrary commands through CSV injection.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **CSV Injection:** The plugin does not properly sanitize data entered into form fields before exporting them into a CSV file. This allows an attacker to embed malicious commands within the data that will be executed when the CSV file is opened by a user.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Remote Command Execution:** By injecting a malicious formula into a comment field, an attacker can achieve command execution on the machine of a user who exports and opens the CSV file. The example provided in the exploit details uses a payload that opens the calculator application on a user's machine. The user needs to have a higher privilege to export the data, the attacker cannot execute directly, but this would be a vector to escalate privileges.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Form Field Injection:** An attacker can inject malicious CSV injection payloads into any form field that is then exported by the plugin. This can include comment fields.
    *   **CSV Export:** The exported CSV is used as the attack vector when a user exports the CSV data and opens it with an application that interprets formulas.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Public User:** The attacker only needs to be able to submit data through a form that is later exported by the plugin.
    *   **Privileged User Interaction**: The attacker requires a privileged user (such as an admin) to export the CSV file.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit description notes that when a high-privileged user logs in, exports the form data as CSV, and opens the file, the injected formula will execute, and a calculator will be displayed.
*   The changelog for version 2.0.5 of the plugin explicitly mentions "CSV Injection was fixed â€“ reported by one of our user (Bhushan B. Patil) CVE-2018-11526."
*   The provided information is significantly more detailed than the typical CVE description.
