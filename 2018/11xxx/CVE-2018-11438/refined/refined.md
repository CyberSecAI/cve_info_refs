The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in libmobi version 0.3, including CVE-2018-11438. Here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-11438:

**CVE-2018-11438**

*   **Root Cause:** Heap-based buffer overflow in the `mobi_decompress_lz77` function within `compression.c`.
*   **Vulnerability:** A heap-based buffer overflow occurs during the decompression of LZ77 compressed data. Specifically, the `buffer_move` function, called by `mobi_decompress_lz77`, writes data beyond the allocated buffer.
*  **Impact:** Remote code execution due to the heap-based buffer overflow.
*   **Attack Vector:** Exploitation is triggered by processing a maliciously crafted MOBI file.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to provide a crafted MOBI file to a user/application using the vulnerable libmobi library.
