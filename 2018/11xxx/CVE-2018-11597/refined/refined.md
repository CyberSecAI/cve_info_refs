Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-11597 (based on the provided context of the issue #1448 which is referenced in the commit message)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper stack management in the `jsparse.c` file of the Espruino project when parsing code blocks. Specifically, the parser doesn't limit the depth of nested code blocks, leading to excessive stack usage when parsing a large number of opening curly braces ('{').

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack overflow due to unbounded recursion.
- Insufficient check on stack depth during parsing of code blocks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) due to stack overflow which can crash the application.
- Potentially other undefined behavior if a stack overflow corrupts memory beyond the stack.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted input files containing a large number of nested opening curly braces ('{').
- Any input stream that the Espruino interpreter handles, allowing arbitrary code execution, could be abused for this DoS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to supply a malicious input file to the Espruino interpreter.
