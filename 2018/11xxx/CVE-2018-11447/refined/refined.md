- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The web interface of SCALANCE M875 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability in the web interface.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can trick a legitimate, authenticated user into accessing a malicious link. This could allow the attacker to interact with the web interface as an administrative user. The attacker could read or modify the device configuration, or exploit other vulnerabilities that require administrative authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to trick a legitimate user into clicking a malicious link while the user is authenticated to the web interface. The web interface is on port 443/tcp.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to trick an authenticated administrative user to click a malicious link. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the web interface initially.
