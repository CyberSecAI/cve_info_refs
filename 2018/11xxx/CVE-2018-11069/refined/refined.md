The provided content is related to CVE-2018-11069.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a covert timing channel during RSA decryption, which is also known as a Bleichenbacher attack on RSA decryption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
A covert timing channel vulnerability exists within the RSA BSAFE SSL-J library. Specifically, this occurs during RSA decryption operations.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A remote attacker may be able to recover an RSA key by exploiting this vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is remote (AV:N).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker does not need any special privileges or user interaction. The attacker needs to have the ability to perform remote timing attacks on the vulnerable system with high precision (AC:H), however they do not need to be authenticated (PR:N).
