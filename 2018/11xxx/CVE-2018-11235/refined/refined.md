{
  "CVE-2018-11235": {
    "description": "A vulnerability in Git that can lead to arbitrary code execution when a user operates in a malicious repository. Specifically, when recursively cloning a repository, Git may execute hooks configured in a checked-in submodule repository.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from Git's handling of submodule configurations within a parent repository. When recursively cloning, Git skips the cloning of submodules if the submodule repository already exists on disk due to being checked into the parent, which is exploited by malicious repos checking in pre-configured hooks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input sanitization",
      "Unvalidated path handling",
      "Execution of untrusted code"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine when cloning a malicious repository.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Cloning a malicious repository with submodules"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to create and host a malicious git repository with a specially crafted .gitmodules and submodule repository containing malicious hook scripts.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs when Git reads the submodule's repository from the parent repository instead of cloning it. The submodule's repository can contain malicious 'post-checkout' hooks that will be executed once the submodule is written to the working directory."

    "CVE-2018-11233": {
    "description": "A path traversal vulnerability exists in git that can result in reading out-of-bounds memory during path sanity checks when used on NTFS filesystems",
        "root_cause": "The `is_ntfs_dotgit()` function in Git does not properly validate pathnames on NTFS, which can result in reading out-of-bounds memory.",
        "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient validation",
        "Out-of-bounds memory read"
        ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can read arbitrary memory, which could expose sensitive information or cause a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "Local access to a vulnerable git client",
        "Specific filesystem (NTFS)"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Local access to a machine with a vulnerable git client where an attacker has control over pathnames within the git repository"
