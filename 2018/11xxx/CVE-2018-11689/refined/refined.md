Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-11689:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization of the `data3` parameter in the `/cgi-bin/webviewer_login_page` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The web application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `data3` parameter in the login page request, before embedding it into the HTML response.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML code into the web page viewed by a user. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:

*   Session hijacking
*   Credential theft
*   Defacement of the web page
*   Redirection to malicious websites
*   Execution of arbitrary code in the user's browser context

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/cgi-bin/webviewer_login_page` endpoint, including malicious JavaScript code in the `data3` parameter. A user would need to be tricked into clicking such a specially crafted link to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to craft a URL containing the malicious script in the `data3` parameter and then lure a user of the vulnerable application to click on this link. This can be achieved through phishing emails, malicious websites, or other social engineering tactics. The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the vulnerable device, they can exploit this remotely, provided the vulnerable DVR is accessible on the network or internet.

**Additional Details**
*   The vulnerable software includes:
    *   Web Viewer for Hanwha DVR 2.17
    *   Smart Viewer in Samsung Web Viewer for Samsung DVR
*   The same web viewer codebase was transitioned from Samsung to Hanwha
*   The vulnerability is present in the `/cgi-bin/webviewer_login_page` endpoint
*   A proof of concept is provided
    ```
    GET /cgi-bin/webviewer_login_page?lang=tu&loginvalue=0&port=0&data3=</script><script>alert(1)</script> HTTP/1.1
    Host: 10.10.10.10
    ```

    The injected script is reflected back in the HTML response
```
document.login_page_submit.data3.value = </script><script>alert(1)</script>;
```
