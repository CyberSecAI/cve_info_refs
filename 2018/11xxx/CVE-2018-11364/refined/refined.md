The provided content contains detailed information about multiple vulnerabilities in ReadStat, specifically referencing CVE-2018-11364.

**Vulnerability 1: Memory Leaks**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the `iconv_open` function within `src/spss/readstat_sav_read.c`. Specifically, the function doesn't properly release allocated memory when processing a crafted input file.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Memory leak due to improper resource handling in `iconv_open`.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Memory exhaustion, potentially leading to denial-of-service.
*   **Attack Vectors:** By providing a specially crafted .sav file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Ability to provide a malformed .sav file to the vulnerable application.

**Vulnerability 2: Infinite Loop**

*   **Root Cause:** An infinite loop in `src/sas/readstat_sas7bcat_read.c` during the processing of a SAS7BCAT file. The loop condition does not terminate correctly with certain crafted input files.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Infinite loop due to flawed logic in parsing the structure of a SAS7BCAT file. Specifically, it is related to the handling of `next_page` and `next_page_pos`.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Denial-of-service through resource exhaustion (CPU time).
*   **Attack Vectors:** By providing a specially crafted .sas7bcat file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Ability to provide a malformed .sas7bcat file to the vulnerable application.

The content also mentions that the vulnerabilities were discovered by fuzzing the code. It details the steps and methodology used in the process and gives a general overview of the library, its usage, and the supported file formats.
