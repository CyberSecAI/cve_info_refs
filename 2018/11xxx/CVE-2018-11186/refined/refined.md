{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper neutralization of special elements used in OS commands across multiple functionalities.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Command injection vulnerabilities in the web interface's JSON-RPC API",
     "Unsanitized user input used in the construction of command line strings.",
    "Multiple instances of code execution vulnerabilities due to lack of input validation.",
     "Privilege escalation vulnerabilities due to webadmin user having sudo access to execute various binaries (perl, env, strace, setsid, and custom shell scripts) as root."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution as root user, leading to full system compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely through the web interface by sending crafted JSON-RPC requests.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Unauthenticated attackers can exploit the login method vulnerability. Other vulnerabilities require valid session cookies."
