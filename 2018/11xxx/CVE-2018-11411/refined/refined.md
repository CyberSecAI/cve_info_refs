{
  "CVE-2018-11411": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `transferFrom` function in the DimonCoin (FUD) smart contract has a flawed implementation that allows for an integer overflow. Specifically, the condition to check for sufficient funds and allowance is incorrect which allows the attacker to transfer more tokens than the account possesses.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Integer overflow in the `transferFrom` function. Incorrect conditional logic for checking sufficient funds and allowance.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can steal all the tokens from a victim's account.",
      "Attack vectors": "By calling the `transferFrom` function with a large enough `_value` parameter and the attacker's address as `_to`, while the victims balance is set as `_from`, an attacker can cause an overflow and transfer all tokens from the victim's account to the attacker's account.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to interact with the smart contract. The attacker needs to have a wallet to receive the stolen tokens."
