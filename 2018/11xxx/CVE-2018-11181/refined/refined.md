Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-11181:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (CWE-78)**. Specifically, user-supplied input is not sanitized before being used in OS commands within the Quest DR Series Disk Backup software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The software is vulnerable to command injection via multiple methods exposed through the JSON-RPC API, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands.
*   **Unsanitized Input:** The application fails to sanitize user-provided input parameters before using them in system calls or shell commands.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** There is a lack of proper input validation on various parameters, which are then passed directly to the OS command line.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the appliance.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By exploiting command injection vulnerabilities, an attacker can gain a foothold and then escalate privileges to root due to the web server user's (webadmin) sudo access to various binaries and scripts.
*   **System Compromise:** Full control of the vulnerable system can be obtained by an attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **JSON-RPC API:** The primary attack vector is through the exposed JSON-RPC API of the Quest DR Series Disk Backup software.
*   **HTTP Requests:** Vulnerable methods are accessed using crafted HTTP POST requests with malicious parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access (for some vulnerabilities):** Some vulnerabilities, such as the one in the `Logon` method, can be exploited without prior authentication.
*  **Authenticated Access (for most vulnerabilities):** Most vulnerabilities require a valid authentication token obtained by logging into the web interface.
*  **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable appliance.

**Specific details for CVE-2018-11181:**

*   **Vulnerable Method:** The `register` method within the `DRCustomerPortal` class is vulnerable.
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `token` parameter is used to inject system commands.
*   **Proof of Concept:** A crafted JSON-RPC request with a malicious `token` parameter is provided to demonstrate the vulnerability, injecting a sleep command.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "register",
  "params": {
    "classname": "DRCustomerPortal",
    "token": "; sleep 10; #"
  },
  "id": 1
}
```
This particular exploit requires a valid authentication token.
