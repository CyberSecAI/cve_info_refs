      "CVE": "CVE-2018-11117",
      "content": "The commit message 'fixed 23026: link attribute' and the code diff in `Services/Feeds/classes/class.ilExternalFeedItem.php` suggest a fix for an issue related to how link attributes are handled in the ILIAS e-learning platform. The vulnerability is related to the `ilUtil::secureLink` function.  \n\nSpecifically, the code diff shows that the code was changed to use `ilUtil::secureUrl` function to secure the URL instead of `ilUtil::secureLink` when setting a link from the feed item. \n\n**Root cause:** The original code used `ilUtil::secureLink` which was not the appropriate function to sanitize/secure the link/URL from a feed item. \n\n**Vulnerabilities present:**  Potentially an insecure URL could have been used because `ilUtil::secureLink` does not properly validate or sanitize the URL. It was likely a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious links into the feed that, if clicked by a user, could potentially lead to XSS attacks or other malicious activities.\n\n**Attack vectors:** By injecting a malicious link into an external feed that is consumed by the ILIAS platform, an attacker could potentially compromise users of the platform. \n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to have control over an external feed that is configured to be ingested by the ILIAS platform.",
      "Additional_details": "The fix implemented replaces `ilUtil::secureLink` with `ilUtil::secureUrl` function for better sanitization of the URL."
