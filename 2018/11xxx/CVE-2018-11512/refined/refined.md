Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2018-11512.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in the "Website's name" field within the WityCMS admin settings. Although there's an attempt to strip `<script>` tags, it's not done recursively, allowing for bypass using a crafted payload.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Stored/Persistent XSS:** The primary vulnerability is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw.
    *   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The system fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before storing it in the configuration file, specifically related to `<script>` tags.
    *   **Non-Recursive Filtering:** The filtering mechanism for `<script>` tags is not recursive, enabling the bypass.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that executes when a user visits the affected website. This code can potentially perform actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing other client-side attacks.
    *   **Account Takeover:** By using malicious javascript, an attacker could potentially obtain user account credentials
    *   **Website Defacement:** Malicious Javascript could be used to deface the website for malicious intent
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Authenticated POST Request:** The attack is performed by an authenticated administrator making a POST request to the `admin/settings/general` endpoint with a malicious payload in the "Website's name" field.
    *   **Payload:** The attacker uses a crafted payload like `<scri<script>pt>alert(1)</scri</script>pt>` to bypass the non-recursive filtering mechanism.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Administrative Access:**  The attacker needs to have administrator-level access to the WityCMS to access the admin settings and modify the "Website's name".
    *   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know about the specific vulnerability in the input validation logic for the "Website's name" field and the non-recursive filtering.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit-db entry provides a proof-of-concept with the payload `<scri<script>pt>alert(1)</scri</script>pt>`.
*   The issue #150 on GitHub shows the vulnerability report and the fix commit `7967e5b` where HTMLPurifier was implemented.
*   The vulnerability exists in wityCMS version 0.6.1
*   The payload is stored in `/system/config/config.php`.
*   The injected code is executed both for authenticated and unauthenticated users.
*   Several components could be affected because they retrieve the script from the config.php. Specifically /apps/user/front/lang/en.xml, /apps/user/front/lang/fr.xml, /apps/settings/admin/templates/general.html, /apps/user/front/main.php, and /cache/templates/apps-settings-admin-templates-general.php
