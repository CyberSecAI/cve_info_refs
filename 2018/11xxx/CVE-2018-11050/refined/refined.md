{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Clear-text authentication over the network in the Rabbit MQ Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) component.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "User credentials are sent unencrypted to the remote AMQP service.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An unauthenticated attacker in the same network collision domain could sniff the password and use it to access the component with the compromised user's privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network sniffing of unencrypted credentials.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be on the same network collision domain as the vulnerable Dell EMC NetWorker server to intercept the network traffic."
