DSA-2018-120: Dell EMC NetWorker Clear-Text authentication over network vulnerability

Dell EMC Identifier: DSA-2018-120
CVE Identifier: CVE-2018-11050
Severity: Medium
Severity Rating: CVSS v3 Base Score 6.3 (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)

Affected products:
*       Dell EMC NetWorker 9.0
*       Dell EMC NetWorker 9.1.1.8 and prior
*       Dell EMC NetWorker 9.2.1.3 and prior
*       Dell EMC NetWorker 18.1.0.1

Summary:
Dell EMC NetWorker Server has been updated to remediate a Clear-Text authentication over network vulnerability that
could potentially be exploited by malicious users to compromise the affected system.

Details:

Dell EMC NetWorker versions between 9.0 and 9.1.1.8 through 9.2.1.3, and the version 18.1.0.1 contain a Clear-Text
authentication over network vulnerability in the Rabbit MQ Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) component. User
credentials are sent unencrypted to the remote AMQP service. An unauthenticated attacker in the same network collision
domain, could potentially sniff the password from the network and use it to access the component using the privileges
of the compromised user.

Resolution:
The following Dell EMC NetWorker releases contain resolutions to this vulnerability:

*       Dell EMC NetWorker 9.1.1.9 and later
*       Dell EMC NetWorker 9.2.1.4 and later
*       Dell EMC NetWorker 18.1.0.2 and later

Customers running NetWorker Server versions 9.x and 18.1.0.1 should upgrade to one of the above fixed versions.

Dell EMC recommends all customers upgrade at the earliest opportunity.  Customers can download a fixed version directly
