```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The libapache-mod-jk connector mishandles URL normalization, leading to information disclosure and privilege escalation. The Apache Web Server (httpd) specific code that normalized the requested path before matching it to the URI-worker map in Apache Tomcat JK (mod_jk) Connector did not handle some edge cases correctly.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Path traversal vulnerability
    - Access control bypass
    - Information disclosure
    - Privilege escalation
- Impact of exploitation:
    -  Exposure of application functionality through the reverse proxy that was not intended for clients accessing the application via the reverse proxy
    - Bypassing of access controls configured in httpd
    - Information disclosure
    - Privilege escalation
- Attack vectors:
   - Specially constructed HTTP requests with crafted URLs
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - Ability to send HTTP requests to a server using the vulnerable mod_jk connector.
