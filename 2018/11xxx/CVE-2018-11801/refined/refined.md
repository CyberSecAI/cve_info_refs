Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-11801:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in Apache Fineract.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   SQL Injection: The application does not properly sanitize user input when constructing SQL queries, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The vulnerability could allow an attacker to perform unauthorized database operations, potentially leading to:
    *   Data breaches (unauthorized access to sensitive information).
    *   Data modification or deletion.
    *   Complete compromise of the application and underlying system in certain scenarios

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The specific attack vector is through a query on the `m_center` data table. This implies the vulnerability is likely within a part of the application which processes data related to `m_center`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the vulnerable application in a way that allows for SQL injection in the query targeting `m_center` table.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Niels Heinen from Google.
*   The issue was fixed in Apache Fineract version 1.3.0.
*   The vulnerability is related to another SQL injection flaw CVE-2018-11800 which affected the `GroupSummaryCounts` table.
*   The Apache Security Team was involved in handling this vulnerability.
