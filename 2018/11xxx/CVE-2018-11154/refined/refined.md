```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Quest DR Series Disk Backup software is vulnerable to multiple command injection vulnerabilities due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input in various JSON-RPC API methods. These methods construct command strings using the unsanitized input, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary system commands.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (CWE-78)",
    "Execution with Unnecessary Privileges (CWE-250)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary system commands with root privileges on the affected appliance, leading to complete system compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the exposed JSON-RPC API of the Quest DR Series Disk Backup software. Attackers can send crafted requests to vulnerable API methods to inject system commands.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker can be unauthenticated for some vulnerabilities (e.g., login method) or require a valid authentication token for others. The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the appliance's web interface."
