- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A null pointer dereference occurs in the `Sass::Functions::selector_append` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Null pointer dereference.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Program crash due to segmentation fault.
- **Attack vectors**: By providing a crafted Sass file that triggers the `selector_append` function with a null pointer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the libsass library, which could be through a program using libsass, or a service that uses it to process Sass files.
