## FAQ

Please, review [user guide](https://docs.algolplus.com/order-export-docs/) at first.

Check [some snippets](https://algolplus.com/plugins/snippets-plugins/) for popular plugins or review [this page](https://algolplus.com/plugins/code-samples/) to study how to extend the plugin.

Still need help? Create ticket in [helpdesk system](https://algolplus.freshdesk.com). Don‚Äôt forget to attach your settings or some screenshots. It will significantly reduce reply time üôÇ

### I want to add a product attribute to the export

Check screenshot #5! You should open section ‚ÄúSet up fields‚Äù, open section ‚ÄúProduct order items‚Äù(right column), click button ‚ÄúAdd field‚Äù, select field in 1st dropdown, type column title and press button ‚ÄúConfirm‚Äù.

### Same order was exported many times

You should open section ‚ÄúSet up fields to export‚Äù and set ‚ÄúFill order columns for‚Äù to ‚Äú1st row only‚Äù. The plugin repeats common information for each order item (by default).

### I see only GREEN fields in section ‚ÄúSet up fields‚Äù

Please, unmark checkbox ‚ÄúSummary Report By Products‚Äù (it‚Äôs below date range)

### Red text flashes at bottom during page loading

It‚Äôs a normal situation. The plugin hides this warning on successful load.

### I can‚Äôt filter/export custom attribute for Simple Product

I‚Äôm sorry, but it‚Äôs impossible. You should add this attribute to Products>Attributes at first and use ‚ÄúFilter by Product Taxonomies‚Äù.

### How can I add a Gravity Forms field to export?

Open order, look at items and remember meta name.

Visit WooCommerce>Export Orders,

open section ‚ÄúSet up fields‚Äù, open section ‚ÄúProduct order items‚Äù(at right), click button ‚ÄúAdd field‚Äù,

select SAME name in second dropdown (screenshot #5)

### Plugin produces unreadable XLS file

The theme or another plugin outputs some lines. Usually, there are extra empty lines at the end of functions.php(in active theme).

### I can‚Äôt export Excel file (blank message or error 500)

Please, increase ‚Äúmemory\_limit‚Äù upto 256M or ask hosting support to do it.

### When exporting .csv containing european special characters , I want to open this csv in Excel without extra actions

You should open tab ‚ÄúCSV‚Äù and set up ISO-8859-1 as codepage.

### Preview shows wrong values, I use Summary mode

This button processes only first 5 orders by default, so you should run the export to see correct values.

### Is it compatible with ‚ÄúWooCommerce Custom Orders Table‚Äù plugin (by Liquid Web) ?

No, as we provide a lot of filters which can not be implemented using WooCommerce classes. So we use direct access to database/tables.

### Where does free version save files?

Free version doesn‚Äôt save generated file on your webserver, you can only download it using browser.

### Can I request any new feature ?

Yes, you can email a request to aprokaev@gmail.com. We intensively develop this plugin.

I recently used the Advanced Order Export For WooCommerce plugin and I am extremely satisfied with its performance. The plugin makes exporting orders from WooCommerce incredibly easy and flexible, offering various customization options to tailor the data export to my needs.
What really stood out, however, was the exceptional support I received from Alex. He was prompt, professional, and incredibly helpful in configuring the plugin to meet my specific requirements. Thanks to his expertise, all my needs were fully fulfilled, and the plugin is now working perfectly for my business.
Highly recommend both the plugin and the support team‚Äîespecially Alex‚Äîfor their outstanding assistance!

PayPal Fee column is empty when exporting, making the plugin useless for accounting

After messing around for years with paid extensions to export order data that took forever and regularly timed out I was amazed to find that this FREE extension handled what I needed and more!Exports are easily filtered using pretty much any meta you could think of and quickly exported. Exports of hundreds of orders take seconds. Love it. Great work.

Second only to WooCommerce itself, this plugin is brilliant and does so much for our website. Although it is advertised and sold as an order export plugin, we use it for a myriad of reports as well as controlling our order flow. We wouldn‚Äôt be without it and cannot praise it highly enough. If that wasn‚Äôt enough, the tremendous support we receive from its author (in the form of coding tips) has allowed us to add extra facilities to our site and improve our admin process tremendously. Thanks AlgolPlus for your continued updates and assistance.

**Vulnerable App:**

```
# Exploit Title: Wordpress Plugin Advanced Order Export For WooCommerce < 1.5.4 - CSV Injection
# Google Dork: N/A
# Date: 2018-06-24
# Exploit Author: Bhushan B. Patil
# Software Link: https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-order-export-lite/
# Affected Version: 1.5.4 and before
# Category: Plugins and Extensions
# Tested on: WiN7_x64
# CVE: CVE-2018-11525

# 1. Application Description:
# The plugin helps you to easily export WooCommerce order data. Export any custom field assigned
# to orders/products/coupons is easy and you can select from various formats to export the data
# in such as CSV, XLS, XML and JSON.

# 2. Technical Description:
# Advanced Order Export For WooCommerce plugin version 1.5.4 and before are affected by the vulnerability
# Remote Command Execution using CSV Injection. This allows a public user to inject commands as a part of
# form fields and when a user with higher privilege exports the form data in CSV opens the file on their machine,
# the command is executed.

# 3. Proof Of Concept:

Enter the payload @SUM(1+1)*cmd|' /C calc'!A0 in the form fields and submit.

# When high privileged user logs into the application to export form data in CSV and opens the file.
# Formula gets executed and calculator will get popped in his machine.

##### About The Exploit Database

√ó

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as ‚ÄúGoogle Hacking‚Äù was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny‚Äôs talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term ‚ÄúGoogledork‚Äù to refer
to ‚Äúa foolish or inept person as revealed by Google‚Äú. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a ‚ÄúGoogle problem‚Äù but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term ‚Äúdork‚Äù became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and ‚Äúdorks‚Äù were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## FAQ

Please, review [user guide](https://docs.algolplus.com/order-export-docs/) at first.

Check [some snippets](https://algolplus.com/plugins/snippets-plugins/) for popular plugins or review [this page](https://algolplus.com/plugins/code-samples/) to study how to extend the plugin.

Still need help? Create ticket in [helpdesk system](https://algolplus.freshdesk.com). Don‚Äôt forget to attach your settings or some screenshots. It will significantly reduce reply time üôÇ

### I want to add a product attribute to the export

Check screenshot #5! You should open section ‚ÄúSet up fields‚Äù, open section ‚ÄúProduct order items‚Äù(right column), click button ‚ÄúAdd field‚Äù, select field in 1st dropdown, type column title and press button ‚ÄúConfirm‚Äù.

### Same order was exported many times

You should open section ‚ÄúSet up fields to export‚Äù and set ‚ÄúFill order columns for‚Äù to ‚Äú1st row only‚Äù. The plugin repeats common information for each order item (by default).

### I see only GREEN fields in section ‚ÄúSet up fields‚Äù

Please, unmark checkbox ‚ÄúSummary Report By Products‚Äù (it‚Äôs below date range)

### Red text flashes at bottom during page loading

It‚Äôs a normal situation. The plugin hides this warning on successful load.

### I can‚Äôt filter/export custom attribute for Simple Product

I‚Äôm sorry, but it‚Äôs impossible. You should add this attribute to Products>Attributes at first and use ‚ÄúFilter by Product Taxonomies‚Äù.

### How can I add a Gravity Forms field to export?

Open order, look at items and remember meta name.

Visit WooCommerce>Export Orders,

open section ‚ÄúSet up fields‚Äù, open section ‚ÄúProduct order items‚Äù(at right), click button ‚ÄúAdd field‚Äù,

select SAME name in second dropdown (screenshot #5)

### Plugin produces unreadable XLS file

The theme or another plugin outputs some lines. Usually, there are extra empty lines at the end of functions.php(in active theme).

### I can‚Äôt export Excel file (blank message or error 500)

Please, increase ‚Äúmemory\_limit‚Äù upto 256M or ask hosting support to do it.

### When exporting .csv containing european special characters , I want to open this csv in Excel without extra actions

You should open tab ‚ÄúCSV‚Äù and set up ISO-8859-1 as codepage.

### Preview shows wrong values, I use Summary mode

This button processes only first 5 orders by default, so you should run the export to see correct values.

### Is it compatible with ‚ÄúWooCommerce Custom Orders Table‚Äù plugin (by Liquid Web) ?

No, as we provide a lot of filters which can not be implemented using WooCommerce classes. So we use direct access to database/tables.

### Where does free version save files?

Free version doesn‚Äôt save generated file on your webserver, you can only download it using browser.

### Can I request any new feature ?

Yes, you can email a request to aprokaev@gmail.com. We intensively develop this plugin.

I recently used the Advanced Order Export For WooCommerce plugin and I am extremely satisfied with its performance. The plugin makes exporting orders from WooCommerce incredibly easy and flexible, offering various customization options to tailor the data export to my needs.
What really stood out, however, was the exceptional support I received from Alex. He was prompt, professional, and incredibly helpful in configuring the plugin to meet my specific requirements. Thanks to his expertise, all my needs were fully fulfilled, and the plugin is now working perfectly for my business.
Highly recommend both the plugin and the support team‚Äîespecially Alex‚Äîfor their outstanding assistance!

PayPal Fee column is empty when exporting, making the plugin useless for accounting

After messing around for years with paid extensions to export order data that took forever and regularly timed out I was amazed to find that this FREE extension handled what I needed and more!Exports are easily filtered using pretty much any meta you could think of and quickly exported. Exports of hundreds of orders take seconds. Love it. Great work.

Second only to WooCommerce itself, this plugin is brilliant and does so much for our website. Although it is advertised and sold as an order export plugin, we use it for a myriad of reports as well as controlling our order flow. We wouldn‚Äôt be without it and cannot praise it highly enough. If that wasn‚Äôt enough, the tremendous support we receive from its author (in the form of coding tips) has allowed us to add extra facilities to our site and improve our admin process tremendously. Thanks AlgolPlus for your continued updates and assistance.
