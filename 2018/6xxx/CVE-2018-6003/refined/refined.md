Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-6003:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `_asn1_decode_simple_ber` function within the `libtasn1` library. Specifically, it's caused by **indefinite recursion** during the decoding of Basic Encoding Rules (BER) data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stack Exhaustion:** The primary vulnerability is a stack exhaustion due to the uncontrolled recursion. When decoding indefinite length strings in BER, the decoder can enter a recursive loop that consumes stack space until it crashes the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation leads to a denial-of-service condition. By providing specially crafted ASN.1 data, an attacker can force the vulnerable application to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The content suggests that a remote attacker can trigger this vulnerability. The attack vector is by providing crafted ASN.1 data that the application attempts to decode. This data can be transmitted over the network, possibly as a part of a protocol or file format that uses ASN.1.
*  **Special files**: Vulnerable services that may not be permanently connected to the network can be exploited via special files (e.g. archives, mail attachments) containing the malicious ASN.1 data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to send or provide crafted ASN.1 data:**  The attacker needs to be able to provide the vulnerable application with a specific type of ASN.1 data that will trigger the infinite recursion. This could be achieved via network protocols or by providing a malicious file.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerable code was introduced in version 1.4.3 of libtasn1.  SUSE bug report indicates that "SUSE:SLE-11-SP1:Update" and "SUSE:SLE-12:Update" are not affected, but "SUSE:SLE-12-SP3:Update" is.
*   **Fix:** The fix involves restricting the recursion level to a limit (3 in the provided patch), preventing the stack exhaustion issue.
*   **Debian Advisory:** Debian issued DSA-4106-1 to address this issue, along with CVE-2017-10790. The fixed version for Debian Stretch is 4.10-1.1+deb9u1.
*  **SUSE Advisory:** SUSE also issued an update to address this issue (SUSE-SU-2018:0295-1, openSUSE-SU-2018:0324-1)
*   **Upstream Fix:** The upstream fix for this vulnerability is available at <http://git.savannah.nongnu.org/cgit/libtasn1.git/commit/?id=c593ae84cfcde8fea45787e53950e0ac71e9ca97>

The provided information gives more context than the generic CVE description, explaining the specific vulnerability within the BER decoding process and how it leads to the denial-of-service condition.
