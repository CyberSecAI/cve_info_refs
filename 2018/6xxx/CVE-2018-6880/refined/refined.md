The provided content describes a path disclosure vulnerability in EmpireCMS versions 6.6, 7.0, and 7.2.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of input parameters in several PHP files. Specifically, the `htmlspecialchars()` and `addslashes()` functions are used without proper type checking. When these functions receive an array as input instead of a string, they throw a PHP error that includes the full server path to the file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **Lack of Input Validation:** The code does not validate if the input parameters are strings before passing them to `htmlspecialchars()` or `addslashes()`. This allows an attacker to pass an array instead of a string.
* **Error Handling:** The default PHP error handling reveals the full file path when an error occurs due to invalid input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can discover the full physical path of the web application on the server. This information can be used to further enumerate vulnerabilities or to plan more targeted attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **HTTP GET Parameters:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending HTTP GET requests with array values for specific parameters in the vulnerable files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Remote Access:** The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server, making it a remote attack. No authentication or special privileges are needed.

**Vulnerable Files:**
*   `/e/admin/tool/ShowPic.php` (EmpireCMS 6.6)
*   `/e/class/connect.php` (EmpireCMS 6.6, 7.0, 7.2)
*   `/e/action/ListInfo.php` (EmpireCMS 6.6)
*  `/e/admin/ecmseditor/infoeditor/epage/TranMore.php` (EmpireCMS 7.0)
*  `/e/data/ecmseditor/infoeditor/epage/TranFile.php` (EmpireCMS 7.2)

**Vulnerable Functions:**
*   `htmlspecialchars()`
*   `addslashes()`
