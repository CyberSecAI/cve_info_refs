Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update for Desktop](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2018/05/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_58.html "Stable Channel Update for Desktop")

Tuesday, May 29, 2018

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 67 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux. This will roll out over the coming days/weeks.

Chrome 67.0.3396.62 contains a number of fixes and improvements -- a list of changes is available in the[log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/66.0.3359.181..67.0.3396.62?pretty=fuller&n=10000). Watch out for upcoming[Chrome](https://chrome.blogspot.com/) and[Chromium](https://blog.chromium.org/) blog posts about new features and big efforts delivered in 67.

**Site Isolation Trial**

We're continuing to roll out [Site Isolation](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/site-isolation) to a larger percentage of the stable population in Chrome 67. Site Isolation improves Chrome's security and [helps mitigate the risks posed by Spectre](https://security.googleblog.com/2018/01/todays-cpu-vulnerability-what-you-need.html).

To diagnose whether an issue is caused by Site Isolation, use chrome://flags#site-isolation-trial-opt-out as described [here](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/site-isolation#TOC-Diagnosing-Issues). Please [report](https://goo.gl/XBoKtY) any trial-specific issues to help us fix them before Site Isolation is launched more broadly.

**Security Fixes and Rewards**

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [34](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+os%3DAndroid%2Cios%2Clinux%2Cmac%2Cwindows%2Call+label%3ARelease-0-M67) security fixes. Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chrome Security Page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[847542](https://crbug.com/847542)] Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer](https://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/undefinedbehaviorsanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity), [libFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer), or [AFL](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/).
