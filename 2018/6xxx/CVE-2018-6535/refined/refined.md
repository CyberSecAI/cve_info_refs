Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2018-6535:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of a non-constant-time password comparison function within Icinga 2.x. Specifically, the `!=` operator used to compare passwords in `icinga::String` which maps to `std::string`'s `!=` operator, is susceptible to timing attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Timing Attack Vulnerability:** The use of a non-constant-time comparison allows an attacker to potentially infer information about the password by measuring the time it takes for the comparison to complete. The comparison will terminate earlier if characters do not match, leading to timing differences based on how many leading characters are correct.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Password Disclosure:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to disclose the password of an API user. This could grant unauthorized access to the Icinga 2 API.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack is network-based, as the API is typically accessed over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Icinga 2 API endpoint.
*   **Knowledge of API User:** The attacker would typically need to know an API username, or be attempting to brute-force the API login, to exploit the timing vulnerability. The attacker would then repeatedly send requests to the API endpoint using different password guesses and measure the response times to infer information about the correct password.

**Additional Details (from provided content):**

*   **Affected Versions:** Icinga 2.x through 2.8.1.
*   **Mitigation:** The fix involves hashing the API passwords and comparing the hashes instead of the plaintext passwords, along with the use of a time-constant comparison function. This is implemented in the changes associated with pull request #5715, which includes changes such as using `PKCS5_PBKDF2_HMAC` to hash passwords, and storing the hashed password with its salt.
*  **Fix:** The fix was introduced in Icinga 2.8.2.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability is rated as high severity with a CVSS v3 base score of 8.1.
*  **Exploit Probability:** The EPSS score is 0.245%, indicating a low probability of exploitation in the next 30 days.
