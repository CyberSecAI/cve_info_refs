# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### @Crunsher **[Crunsher](/Crunsher)** commented [Nov 2, 2017](#issue-270727201)

This change requires (afaik, TODO: test) openssl version 1.X to work. To my knowledge this is supported by even Sles 11, Solaris 10 and AIX.

The patch adds the option to save passwords as hashes, the new `api user` command can create them, and hashes clear text passwords at startup.

This should protect icinga2 against timing attacks and improperly secured config files. It is backwards compatible and should not break any other applications.

| TODO:   1. Tests are currently *VERY* ugly. Could be solved with a friend class (Edit: they also fail outside of Debug builds atm) 2. Documentation 3. Clean up code a bit 4. Possibly give the `api user` command the option to update existing users |

The getter and setters for passwords are only available in a debug build. To prevent other modules from setting them in the future. I tried to solve this by using friend classes but failed dramatically.

So tests are still an open todo

| I've now understood its purpose, I feared that this would need a local storage (which it does not). The variable names should apply our coding style, similar to some other locations marked in the review. Config rendering and API password comparison needs to be fixed too. Once that's done, I'll test the PR :) |

| Additional idea by Gunnar:   1. Make Password a non-config object 2. Make HashedPassword a Config object 3. If there is no HashedPassword, hash Password with salt and write it to HashedPassword 4. Clear Password 5. Only the HashedPassowrd will show up in object list and we won't have the clear text password in RAM |

| I just stumbled across this PR, sorry for commenting on this long after it was merged.  Maybe we should make the --passwd argument optional and have Icinga generate a random password when it's omitted. What do you think?  This sounds like a good idea to me. Passing the password as a command line argument leaks it to other users on the system via the process list. IMHO there should be some alternative method like reading it from the console, using an environment variable, generating a random password, etc.  I thought about this as well, but then we'd have to print the password out to console. Which would then make the workflow icinga2 api user ... > .../api\_user.conf impossible  You could print the config snippet to stdout and the cleartext password to stderr. Then redirecting stdout to a file would still show the password in the terminal. |

API user credentials are compared using the != operator on icinga::String which maps directly to the != operator of std::string which is not guaranteed to be constant time and thus is likely vulnerable to timing attacks.

An alternative to making the comparision time constant would be always save the API passwords hashed.
