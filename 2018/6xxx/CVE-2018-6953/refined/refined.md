Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6953:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper validation of the Length field within the NDNTLV (Named Data Networking Tag-Length-Value) parser in the CCN-lite library. The parser blindly accepts the Length field of a Name component without verifying if it matches the actual size of the component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The core weakness is the parser's failure to check if the declared length of a component in an NDNTLV packet matches its actual size.
*   **Out-of-bounds Memory Access:**  Due to the unchecked length, the code can read past the end of a buffer when parsing NDNTLV packets, specifically when calling `ccnl_ndntlv_dehead` repeatedly.
*   **Potential Buffer Overflows:** In several functions that use the parsed prefix, such as `ccnl_prefix_dup`, the incorrect length can lead to buffer overflows. For example, `memcpy` might copy more bytes than allocated, leading to `p->bytes` buffer overflow.
*   **Out-of-bounds Memory Accesses in Prefix operations:** In functions like `ccnl_prefix_cmp` and `ccnl_prefix_debug_info` incorrect component lengths can cause out-of-bounds reads.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** By crafting a malicious NDNTLV packet with incorrect length fields, an attacker could crash the application, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not directly stated, buffer overflows could potentially be exploited to gain code execution, depending on the application's environment and how memory is allocated.
*   **Information Exposure:** Out-of-bounds reads could expose sensitive information from the application's memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious NDNTLV Packets:** The attack vector is sending specially crafted NDNTLV packets to the vulnerable system. This involves manipulating the length field within the packet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to a system running a vulnerable version of CCN-lite.
*  The attacker needs to have knowledge of the NDNTLV packet format and the CCN-lite implementation to create packets with manipulated length fields.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involves adding checks to ensure that the length value in a TLV is not greater than the remaining buffer size.
*   The vulnerability is present in multiple locations where the component lengths were used without prior validation.
*  The issue was fixed by rejecting NDN packets with TLV length values exceeding buffer size.
* The fix was merged into the master branch
*  The vulnerability was identified in multiple packet parsing functions (NDNTLV, CCNTLV, IOTTLV), requiring similar fixes across those components.
