## Accelerate performance

With GitHub Copilot embedded throughout the platform, you can simplify your toolchain, automate tasks, and improve the developer experience.

![](https://github.githubassets.com/assets/particles-de1dd20f3008.png)A Copilot chat window with extensions enabled. The user inputs the @ symbol to reveal a list of five Copilot Extensions. @Sentry is selected from the list, which shifts the window to a chat directly with that extension. There are three sample prompts at the bottom of the chat window, allowing the user to Get incident information, Edit status on incident, or List the latest issues. The last one is activated to send the prompt: @Sentry List the latest issues. The extension then lists several new issues and their metadata.

## Description

[![@blacksheeep](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3641597?u=db681f01696d1ae2f64c22c60f29c78eeb3345eb&v=4&size=48)](/blacksheeep)[blacksheeep](https://github.com/blacksheeep)opened [on Feb 13, 2018](https://github.com/cn-uofbasel/ccn-lite/issues/195#issue-296813563)

The Parser of NDNTLV accepts Length field of the Name without any checks.

Therefore, it is possible, that the value of the length flied of a component of a prefix and the actual size of the component differ.

in `ccnl-pkt/ccnl-pkt-ndntlv.c`:

```
161     while (len2 > 0) {
162           if (ccnl_ndntlv_dehead(&cp, &len2, (int*) &typ, &i)) {
...
172                   p->comp[p->compcnt] = cp;
173                   p->complen[p->compcnt] = i;
...
175           }
176           cp += i;
177           len2 -= i;
```

This issue can lead to a out of bound memory access, when executing ccnl\_ndntlv\_dehead again.

Additionally, on many places CCN-lite assumes, that the length of the prefix is always correct.

By not having the length matching the actual component length, buffer overflows or out of bound memory accesses can occur on many places, e.g.:

* `ccnl_prefix_dup`: buffer overflow, `memcpy(p->bytes + len, prefix->comp[i], p->complen[i]);` copies to many bytes if `p->complen[i]) > len(prefix->comp[i])`, which can lead to a buffer overflow of `p->bytes`.
* `ccnl_prefix_cmp`: out of bound memory access, `if (clen != nam->complen[i] || memcmp(comp, nam->comp[i], nam->complen[i]))`.
* `ccnl_prefix_debug_info`: out of bound memory access, `len += snprintf(buf + len, CCNL_MAX_PACKET_SIZE - len, "%.*s", p->complen[i], p->comp[i]);`.

This pull request fixes [#195](https://github.com/cn-uofbasel/ccn-lite/issues/195) [[CVE-2018-6953](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mcc7-qxrw-m8m8 "CVE-2018-6953")] by rejecting NDN packet, if the length value in a TLV is greater than the entire buffer.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Do we need a check on the len? What happens if the `len` is negative. Does this affect the rest of the code in the function?

ok, on another position this is used as status code. so i cannot make unsigned in a simple way. nevertheless, the function ensures, len value is at least 4. otherwise packet will be dropped. so this is not an issue here.

| Len value is used as status value, need more effort to make it unsigned. nevertheless, all dehead functions ensure, that len is at least the minimum required length of a TLV. thus, a packet with negative len values in the tlv will just be dropped, which seems to be the correct behavior. The signed length is not an issue or cve. To make it unsigned should be another PR. |
