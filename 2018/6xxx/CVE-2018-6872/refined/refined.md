Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2018-6872:

**CVE-2018-6872**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies within the `elf_parse_notes` function in `elf.c` of the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (libbfd) in GNU Binutils 2.30. The function improperly handles a large alignment value within a note of an ELF file.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Out-of-bounds Read:** The `elf_parse_notes` function attempts to read memory beyond the allocated buffer when encountering a note with a large alignment.
    *   **Integer Overflow:** Implicit integer overflow due to a missing `bfd_size_type` multiplication.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The out-of-bounds read leads to a segmentation violation, resulting in an application crash.
*  **Attack vectors**
    *  Crafted ELF File: A malicious ELF file with a crafted note containing a large alignment can trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Remote Attacker:** A remote attacker could exploit this by enticing a user to process a malicious ELF file via a tool from GNU binutils like objdump.
    *   **Local Attacker:** A local attacker could also cause the same crash by processing a malicious ELF file.
    * **User Interaction:** User interaction is required, either by a user processing a crafted file (e.g., objdump) or by a program being triggered to load such file.

**Additional Notes:**

*   SUSE considers binutils as a developer tool, not intended to process untrusted input. They recommend processing untrusted binaries on a separate system or virtual machine.
*   The SUSE Security Team indicates that a security exploit could easily inject regular binary code, thus updating binutils is not done very often.
*   SUSE Bugzilla entry 1080556 indicates this issue was resolved by a patch or update.
