Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6766:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the insecure way Swisscom TVMediaHelper loads DLL files. Specifically, it does not properly validate the origin or authenticity of DLLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **DLL Side-Loading:** The application loads DLLs (dwmapi.dll, PROPSYS.dll, cscapi.dll, SAMLIB.dll, netbios.dll, winhttp.dll, security.dll, ntmarta.dll, WindowsCodecs.dll, apphelp.dll) from locations where an attacker can place malicious versions. This is a classic DLL side-loading vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the targeted system with the privileges of the TVMediaHelper application.
- **Complete System Compromise:** Depending on the application's privileges, this could potentially lead to a complete compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system where Swisscom TVMediaHelper is installed.
- **DLL Replacement:** The attacker must be able to place a malicious DLL with the same name as one of the vulnerable DLLs in a directory that the application searches before finding the legitimate one.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to write files to the local system.
- The attacker needs to know the directories the application searches for DLLs and the names of the vulnerable DLLs the application loads.
- No specific user interaction is required, other than the execution of the vulnerable application

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Swisscom TVMediaHelper version 1.1.0.50.
- The advisory lists several DLLs that are vulnerable.
- The vulnerable application was removed by the vendor.
- The vulnerability was reported through the Swisscom bug bounty program.
