{
  "CVE-2018-6759": {
    "Description": "The bfd_get_debug_link_info_1 function in opncls.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.30, has an unchecked strnlen operation. Remote attackers could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) via a crafted ELF file.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from an unchecked `strnlen` operation within the `bfd_get_debug_link_info_1` function in `opncls.c`. Specifically, the function does not validate if the provided `name` parameter is a valid pointer before passing it to `strnlen`. If the `name` parameter is `NULL`, `strnlen` will dereference a null pointer, causing a segmentation fault.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unchecked `strnlen` operation, NULL pointer dereference.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) by enticing a user to compile/execute a specially crafted ELF file, or use a tool like objdump or nm.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is via a crafted ELF file that contains a malformed debug link section, which when processed by vulnerable binutils tools triggers the unchecked `strnlen`.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to create a malformed ELF file and entice a user to process the file using a vulnerable version of binutils."
