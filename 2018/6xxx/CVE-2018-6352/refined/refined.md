- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Excessive iteration in the `PdfParser::ReadObjectsInternal` function within the PoDoFo library. The number of iterations of a loop is directly controlled by a value in the input PDF file, leading to a potential denial of service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is caused by an uncontrolled loop within the PDF parsing logic. Specifically, the loop in `PdfParser::ReadObjectsInternal` iterates based on a value from the PDF file which can be manipulated to be extremely large.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can craft a malicious PDF file that, when processed by PoDoFo, will cause excessive iteration in a loop resulting in a denial of service due to the significant time it takes to process.
- **Attack vectors:** By providing a specially crafted PDF file, an attacker can trigger this excessive iteration when PoDoFo is used to parse the file, such as through the `podofoimgextract` tool.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted PDF file to an application that uses the vulnerable PoDoFo library. No special privileges are needed.
