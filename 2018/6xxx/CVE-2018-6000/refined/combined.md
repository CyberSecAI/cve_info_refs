## **Vulnerability Management for a Variety of Industries**

Nearly every industry relies on applications and networks to conduct business, though some have more stringent security requirements than others. Organizations in the aviation, automotive, healthcare, and financial sectors have some of the strongest security regulations. Layers of security during software and application development as well as after product deployment are necessary to keep consumers safe and organizations compliant.

![airplane icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilitiesaviation.png)

### [Aviation](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/aviation-software-testing-guide)

Cybersecurity is crucial to the aviation industry. Travelers in the sky need to be protected from any attacks that can prevent airlines from operating normally. Those same customers need to have their payment and sensitive data protected when purchasing a ticket.

### [Automotive](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guide/how-fuzz-testing-helps-secure-automotive-industry)

Wireless connectivity is becoming commonplace inside of new vehicles. Automotive connectivity to WIFI and Bluetooth are making vehicles a bigger target for cybercriminals. One vulnerability can take down any vehicle with that technology. DAST, Black Box Fuzzing, and SAST during development are a solid foundation of security to prevent these attacks.

![](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-automative.png)

![heartbeat](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-healthcare.png)

### [Healthcare and Medical](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/security-testing-for-networked-medical-devices)

Wireless technology and application software are being used more in medical devices to automate and monitor individual healthcare needs. Device security is the utmost priority, preventing risks that can directly endanger lives. Application security is needed to prevent cyber attackers from tampering with devices and stealing private healthcare data. SAST and DAST during development can help find vulnerabilities that can compromise these devices.

### Critical Infrastructure and Industrial Facilities

Water, power, and gas are some prime targets for large scale attacks. The best way to keep cyberattackers from taking down an entire city’s water supply is to create a layered cybersecurity portfolio. From the start, vulnerabilities need to be identified, remediated, and constantly monitored to prevent a mass standstill of public utilities.

![lightning bolt icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-critical-industries.png)

![factory](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-manufactures.png)

### Discrete Manufacturers

Manufacturing industries keep building and assembling essential pieces for everyday life. Any attack on that automation would create a bottleneck in multiple industries that rely on these products. A disruption in manufacturing has been proven to drive up prices and create a negative workflow ripple worldwide. Using layered security solutions prior to deployment and scanning afterwards will help prevent any shutdown.

### Financial

Financial institutions are still top cyberattacker targets. Monetary apps for banks, credit unions, investment, and retirement firms need the highest cybersecurity measures. Security that prevents cyberattacks should be implemented during development and embedded directly into these applications. Compliance for this industry is only growing with each reported breach.

>> Background and summaryAsusWRT is the operating system used in mid range and high end Asus routers. It is based on Linux, but with a sleek web UI and a slimmed down profile suitable for running on resource constrained routers.Thankfully ASUS is a responsible company, and not only they publish the full source code as required by the GPL, but they also give users full root access to their router via SSH. Overall the security of their operating system is decent, especially when compared to other router manufacturers.
However due to a number of coding errors, it is possible for an unauthenticated attacker in the LAN to achieve remote code execution in the router as the root user.
A special thanks to Beyond Security SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure (SSD) programme for disclosing these vulnerabilities to the manufacturer, speeding the resolution of the issues discovered (see [1] for their advisory).
>> Technical details:#1Vulnerability: HTTP server authentication bypassCVE-2018-5999Attack Vector: RemoteConstraints: None; exploitable by an unauthenticated attackerAffected versions: confirmed on v3.0.0.4.380.7743; possibly affects every version before v3.0.0.4.384.10007
The AsusWRT HTTP server has a flaw in handle\_request() that allows an unauthenticated user to perform a POST request for certain actions.In AsusWRT\_source/router/httpd/httpd.c:
handle\_request(void){... handler->auth(auth\_userid, auth\_passwd, auth\_realm); auth\_result = auth\_check(auth\_realm, authorization, url, file, cookies, fromapp);
 if (auth\_result != 0) <--- auth fails { if(strcasecmp(method, "post") == 0){ if (handler->input) { handler->input(file, conn\_fp, cl, boundary); <--- but POST request is still processed } send\_login\_page(fromapp, auth\_result, NULL, NULL, 0); } //if(!fromapp) http\_logout(login\_ip\_tmp, cookies); return; }...}
This can (and will) be combined with other vulnerabilities to achieve remote code execution.
#2Vulnerability: Unauthorised configuration change (NVRAM value setting)CVE-2018-6000Attack Vector: RemoteConstraints: None; exploitable by an unauthenticated attackerAffected versions: confirmed on v3.0.0.4.380.7743; possibly affects every version before v3.0.0.4.384.10007
By abusing vulnerability #1 and POSTing to vpnupload.cgi, we can invoke do\_vpnupload\_post() in the HTTP server code, which has a vulnerability that allows an attacker to set NVRAM configuration values directly from the request.In AsusWRT\_source/router/httpd/web.c:
do\_vpnupload\_post(char \*url, FILE \*stream, int len, char \*boundary){... if (!strncasecmp(post\_buf, "Content-Disposition:", 20)) { if(strstr(post\_buf, "name=\"file\"")) break; else if(strstr(post\_buf, "name=\"")) { offset = strlen(post\_buf); fgets(post\_buf+offset, MIN(len + 1, sizeof(post\_buf)-offset), stream); len -= strlen(post\_buf) - offset; offset = strlen(post\_buf); fgets(post\_buf+offset, MIN(len + 1, sizeof(post\_buf)-offset), stream); len -= strlen(post\_buf) - offset; p = post\_buf; name = strstr(p, "\"") + 1; p = strstr(name, "\""); strcpy(p++, "\0"); value = strstr(p, "\r\n\r\n") + 4; p = strstr(value, "\r"); strcpy(p, "\0"); //printf("%s=%s\n", name, value); nvram\_set(name, value); } }...}
These NVRAM values contain very important configuration variables, such as the admin password, which can be set in this way by an authenticated or unauthenticated attacker.
Once that is done, code execution is easily achieved. One option is to login to the web interface with the new password, enable SSH, reboot the router and login via SSH.
A more elegant option is to abuse infosvr, which is a UDP daemon running on port 9999.The daemon has a special mode where it executes a command received in a packet as the root user. This special mode is only enabled if ateCommand\_flag is set to 1, which most likely only happens during factory testing or QA (it was not enabled by default in the firmware distributed by Asus in their website).
However we can set ateCommand\_flag to 1 using the VPN configuration upload technique described above and then send a PKT\_SYSCMD to infosvr. The daemon will read a command from the packet and execute it as root, achieving our command execution cleanly - without changing any passwords.
(Note: infosvr used to allow unauthenticated command execution without the ateCommand\_flag being set, which led to Joshua Drake's (jduck) discovery of CVE-2014-9583, see [2]; this was fixed by Asus in early 2015).
Packet structure (from AsusWRT\_source/router/shared/iboxcom.h):- Header typedef struct iboxPKTEx { BYTE ServiceID; BYTE PacketType; WORD OpCode; DWORD Info; // Or Transaction ID BYTE MacAddress[6]; BYTE Password[32]; //NULL terminated string, string length:1~31, cannot be NULL string } ibox\_comm\_pkt\_hdr\_ex;
- Body typedef struct iboxPKTCmd { WORD len; BYTE cmd[420]; <--- command goes here } PKT\_SYSCMD; // total 422 bytes
A Metasploit module exploiting this vulnerability has been released [3].
>> Fix:Upgrade to AsusWRT v3.0.0.4.384.10007 or above.See [4] for the very few details and new firmware released by Asus.Note that the Agile Information Security DID NOT test the fixed version or verify the fixes, as this is the responsibility of Asus.

The HTTP server in AsusWRT has a flaw where it allows an unauthenticated client to
perform a POST in certain cases. This can be combined with another vulnerability in
the VPN configuration upload routine that sets NVRAM configuration variables directly
from the POST request to enable a special command mode.
This command mode can then be abused by sending a UDP packet to infosvr, which is running
on port UDP 9999 to directly execute commands as root.
This exploit leverages that to start telnetd in a random port, and then connects to it.
It has been tested with the RT-AC68U running AsusWRT Version 3.0.0.4.380.7743.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

**Vulnerable App:**

```
>> Unauthenticated LAN remote code execution in AsusWRT
>> Discovered by Pedro Ribeiro (pedrib@gmail.com), Agile Information Security
=================================================================================
Disclosure: 22/01/2018 / Last updated: 25/01/2018

>> Background and summary
AsusWRT is the operating system used in mid range and high end Asus routers. It is based on Linux, but with a sleek web UI and a slimmed down profile suitable for running on resource constrained routers.
Thankfully ASUS is a responsible company, and not only they publish the full source code as required by the GPL, but they also give users full root access to their router via SSH. Overall the security of their operating system is pretty good, especially when compared to other router manufacturers.

However due to a number of coding errors, it is possible for an unauthenticated attacker in the LAN to achieve remote code execution in the router as the root user.

A special thanks to Beyond Security SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure (SSD) programme for disclosing these vulnerabilities to the manufacturer, speeding the resolution of the issues discovered (see [1] for their advisory).

>> Technical details:
#1
Vulnerability: HTTP server authentication bypass
CVE-2018-5999
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: None; exploitable by an unauthenticated attacker
Affected versions: confirmed on v3.0.0.4.380.7743; possibly affects every version before v3.0.0.4.384.10007

The AsusWRT HTTP server has a flaw in handle_request() that allows an unauthenticated user to perform a POST request for certain actions.
In AsusWRT_source/router/httpd/httpd.c:

handle_request(void)
{
...
	handler->auth(auth_userid, auth_passwd, auth_realm);
	auth_result = auth_check(auth_realm, authorization, url, file, cookies, fromapp);

	if (auth_result != 0)                                     <--- auth fails
	{
		if(strcasecmp(method, "post") == 0){
			if (handler->input) {
				handler->input(file, conn_fp, cl, boundary);        <--- but POST request is still processed
			}
			send_login_page(fromapp, auth_result, NULL, NULL, 0);
		}
		//if(!fromapp) http_logout(login_ip_tmp, cookies);
		return;
	}
...
}

This can (and will) be combined with other vulnerabilities to achieve remote code execution.

#2
Vulnerability: Unauthorised configuration change (NVRAM value setting)
CVE-2018-6000
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: None; exploitable by an unauthenticated attacker
Affected versions: confirmed on v3.0.0.4.380.7743; possibly affects every version before v3.0.0.4.384.10007

By abusing vulnerability #1 and POSTing to vpnupload.cgi, we can invoke do_vpnupload_post() in the HTTP server code, which has a vulnerability that allows an attacker to set NVRAM configuration values directly from the request.
In AsusWRT_source/router/httpd/web.c:

do_vpnupload_post(char *url, FILE *stream, int len, char *boundary)
{
...
	if (!strncasecmp(post_buf, "Content-Disposition:", 20)) {
		if(strstr(post_buf, "name=\"file\""))
			break;
		else if(strstr(post_buf, "name=\"")) {
			offset = strlen(post_buf);
			fgets(post_buf+offset, MIN(len + 1, sizeof(post_buf)-offset), stream);
			len -= strlen(post_buf) - offset;
			offset = strlen(post_buf);
			fgets(post_buf+offset, MIN(len + 1, sizeof(post_buf)-offset), stream);
			len -= strlen(post_buf) - offset;
			p = post_buf;
			name = strstr(p, "\"") + 1;
			p = strstr(name, "\"");
			strcpy(p++, "\0");
			value = strstr(p, "\r\n\r\n") + 4;
			p = strstr(value, "\r");
			strcpy(p, "\0");
			//printf("%s=%s\n", name, value);
			nvram_set(name, value);
		}
	}
...
}

These NVRAM values contain very important configuration variables, such as the admin password, which can be set in this way by an authenticated or unauthenticated attacker.

Once that is done, code execution is easily achieved. One option is to login to the web interface with the new password, enable SSH, reboot the router and login via SSH.

A more elegant option is to abuse infosvr, which is a UDP daemon running on port 9999.
The daemon has a special mode where it executes a command received in a packet as the root user. This special mode is only enabled if ateCommand_flag is set to 1, which most likely only happens during factory testing or QA (it was not enabled by default in the firmware distributed by Asus in their website).

However we can set ateCommand_flag to 1 using the VPN configuration upload technique described above and then send a PKT_SYSCMD to infosvr. The daemon will read a command from the packet and execute it as root, achieving our command execution cleanly - without changing any passwords.

(Note: infosvr used to allow unauthenticated command execution without the ateCommand_flag being set, which led to Joshua Drake's (jduck) discovery of CVE-2014-9583, see [2]; this was fixed by Asus in early 2015).

Packet structure (from AsusWRT_source/router/shared/iboxcom.h):
- Header
  typedef struct iboxPKTEx
  {
    BYTE		ServiceID;
    BYTE		PacketType;
    WORD		OpCode;
    DWORD 		Info; // Or Transaction ID
    BYTE		MacAddress[6];
    BYTE		Password[32];   //NULL terminated string, string length:1~31, cannot be NULL string
  } ibox_comm_pkt_hdr_ex;

- Body
  typedef struct iboxPKTCmd
  {
    WORD		len;
    BYTE		cmd[420];		<--- command goes here
  } PKT_SYSCMD;		// total 422 bytes

A Metasploit module exploiting this vulnerability has been released [3].

>> Fix:
Upgrade to AsusWRT v3.0.0.4.384.10007 or above.
See [4] for the very few details and new firmware released by Asus.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
