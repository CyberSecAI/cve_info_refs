Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6806:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization in the `/preview` URL handler of the Marked application. This handler was susceptible to processing and executing arbitrary JavaScript code included within the input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Lack of input sanitization:** The application did not properly sanitize user-supplied input before rendering it in the `/preview` handler. Specifically, it did not strip or neutralize JavaScript code.
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:**  The vulnerability allowed for the injection and execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the application.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Local file disclosure:** The provided report attached to the discussion mentions a "Local File Disclosure" vulnerability, which would allow an attacker to potentially read sensitive files from the user's system by exploiting the arbitrary JavaScript execution flaw.
*   **Other malicious actions:** By injecting and executing arbitrary JavaScript, an attacker could potentially perform various other malicious actions within the context of the application, which could lead to further compromise.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Maliciously crafted URL:** An attacker could craft a URL containing malicious JavaScript code and then trick a user into opening it in the Marked application.
*   **URL Preview functionality:** The `/preview` handler would process the crafted URL allowing the embedded JavaScript to execute.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to craft a URL:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL containing malicious JavaScript.
*   **User interaction:** The attacker needs to trick a user into opening the crafted URL with the vulnerable application.

**Mitigation:**

The vulnerability was mitigated by stripping all `<script>` tags and parsing out any `on[Click/Load/mouse(enter|leave),etc.]` attributes from tags in the `/preview` handler. This prevents the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code, and thus prevents local file disclosure and any other malicious activity resulting from the execution of such code.
