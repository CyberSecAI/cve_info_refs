Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- A server setting (`rh_shell_fix_path`) allowed site administrators to override the `PATH` environment variable used when executing shell commands related to worker processes. Specifically, this setting intended to provide a fix for systems using Software Collections (SCL) for PHP, where the necessary binaries might not be in the default path. However, the path was not properly validated, allowing the administrator to inject arbitrary commands by manipulating this variable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Command Injection:** By modifying the `rh_shell_fix_path` setting, a site administrator could inject arbitrary commands into the `PATH` variable. These injected commands would then be executed when the application tried to run other shell commands, such as starting worker processes. This is because the application prepended this path to the command executed with shell_exec().
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application did not properly validate the `rh_shell_fix_path` setting. It should have ensured that this value was a valid path and did not contain any malicious code, but only tested if the path was present instead of validating the content of the path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A malicious site administrator could execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the web server user. This could lead to a complete compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Settings Manipulation:** A malicious or compromised site administrator could modify the `rh_shell_fix_path` setting to include malicious commands.
- **Admin Panel Access:** The attack requires access to the administration panel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Site Administrator Access:** The attacker needs to be a site administrator in the MISP application to modify the server settings.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability is located in `app/Controller/ServersController.php` where the `shell_exec()` is called to start or restart the worker processes. The `rh_shell_fix_path` setting is prepended to the command before being executed by `shell_exec()`.
- The `app/Model/Server.php` defines the `rh_shell_fix_path` setting.
- The vulnerability was fixed by removing the ability to configure the path with a user defined value, effectively hardcoding the path instead of using the config setting.
- The vulnerability is described in the commit message: `- a server setting allowing the override of the path variable for esoteric RHEL systems allowed site admins to inject arbitrary commands`.

**Additional Notes:**

- The content explicitly mentions the setting being only accessible to the site administrator, which limits the attack surface.
- The fix removed the ability to specify a custom path, preventing the injection.
