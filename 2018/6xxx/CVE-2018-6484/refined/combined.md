```
Several issues have been fixed in zziplib, a library providing read access
on ZIP-archives. They are basically all related to invalid memory access
and resulting crash or memory leak.
```

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
0.13.62-3+deb8u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your zziplib packages.

# Bus error in \_\_zzip\_fetch\_disk\_trailer (src/zzip/zip.c) [CVE-2018-6484]Â #14

## Description

[![@ProbeFuzzer](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35150299?v=4&size=48)](/ProbeFuzzer)[ProbeFuzzer](https://github.com/ProbeFuzzer)opened [on Feb 1, 2018](https://github.com/gdraheim/zziplib/issues/14#issue-293390290)

On latest version (0.13.67) and master branch of zziplib:

there is a bus error caused by loading of misaligned address in \_\_zzip\_fetch\_disk\_trailer function of src/zzip/zip.c, which could be triggered by the POC below.

The issue happens since the struct zzip\_disk\_trailer "orig" (line 318) could be manipulated by a crafted zip file, resulting in a misaligned memory access and bus error. Note that the issue is in libzip and may affect downstream programs. The POC is as small as 100 bytes.

```
312                     struct zzip_disk_trailer *orig =
313                         (struct zzip_disk_trailer *) tail;
...
318                     trailer->zz_rootseek = zzip_disk_trailer_rootseek(orig);

```

To reproduce the issue, run: ./zzdir $POC

The POC could be downloaded at: <https://github.com/ProbeFuzzer/poc/blob/master/zziplib/zziplib_0-13-67_zzdir_memory-alignment-errors___zzip_fetch_disk_trailer.zip>

master/src/zzip/zip.c:315:43: runtime error: load of misaligned address 0x7f079d64a027 for type 'uint16\_t', which requires 2 byte alignment

0x7f079d64a027: note: pointer points here

# USN-3699-1: zziplib vulnerabilities

3 July 2018

zziplib could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it opened a
specially crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [zziplib](/security/cves?package=zziplib) - library providing read access on ZIP-archives - library

## Details

It was discovered that zziplib incorrectly handled certain malformed ZIP

files. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially

crafted ZIP file, a remote attacker could cause zziplib to crash, resulting

in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.
