Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6556:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `lxc-user-nic` utility, when invoked with the `delete` command, would unconditionally open a user-provided path using its effective UID 0. This path was intended to be a network namespace file, but the program did not properly validate that it was and would attempt to open any path provided.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information leak**: An unprivileged user could use the `lxc-user-nic` utility to probe for the existence of files that they should not have access to.
- **Side effects**: By opening special files, device files, or files in /proc or /sys, an unprivileged user could trigger code paths in the kernel that they normally could not access, potentially leading to denial-of-service (DoS) conditions or other unspecified impact.
- **Lack of input validation**: The program did not properly validate that the provided path was a network namespace file before attempting to open it using privileged permissions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: The vulnerability allowed unprivileged users to potentially determine the existence of arbitrary files on the host system.
- Denial-of-service: By opening certain special files, the vulnerability could potentially trigger resource exhaustion or other unexpected kernel behavior, leading to DoS.
- Other unspecified impact: By triggering previously inaccessible kernel code paths, it could potentially have more complex consequences.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local: The vulnerability could be exploited by a local user with access to the vulnerable `lxc-user-nic` utility.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- A local user able to execute the `lxc-user-nic` binary.
- The attacker must have the ability to pass an arbitrary path to the `lxc-user-nic` binary when using the `delete` command.
- The `lxc-user-nic` binary must be setuid.
