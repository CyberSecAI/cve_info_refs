The provided content relates to CVE-2018-6542.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a crafted zip file that can manipulate the "trailer" pointer in the `zzip_disk_findfirst` function of `src/zzip/mmapped.c`, leading to a misaligned memory access.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Misaligned memory access: The `zzip_disk64_trailer_get_rootseek` function attempts to dereference a pointer ("trailer") that can be manipulated to point to a memory address that is not properly aligned for a `uint64_t` read, resulting in a bus error.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Bus error/crash: Exploitation results in a bus error that causes the application to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted zip file: The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted zip file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted zip file to be processed by the vulnerable application (zziplib).
