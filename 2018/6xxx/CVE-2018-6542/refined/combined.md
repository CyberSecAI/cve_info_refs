# Bus error when handling (root seek of disk64\_trailer) in zzip\_disk\_findfirst (src/zzip/mmapped.c) [CVE-2018-6542]Â #17

## Description

[![@ProbeFuzzer](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35150299?v=4&size=48)](/ProbeFuzzer)[ProbeFuzzer](https://github.com/ProbeFuzzer)opened [on Feb 1, 2018](https://github.com/gdraheim/zziplib/issues/17#issue-293591362)

On latest version (0.13.67) and master branch of zziplib:

there is a bus error (when handling seek of disk64\_trailer) caused by loading of misaligned address in zzip\_disk\_findfirst function of src/zzip/mmapped.c, which could be triggered by the POC below. Note that this issue is different from [#15](https://github.com/gdraheim/zziplib/issues/15).

The issue happens since the pointer "trailer" (line 444) could be manipulated by a crafted zip file, resulting in a misaligned memory access and bus error. Note that the issue is in libzip and may affect downstream programs. The POC is as small as 100 bytes.

```
444             zzip_size_t rootseek = zzip_disk64_trailer_get_rootseek(trailer);

```

To reproduce the issue, run: ./unzip-mem -p $POC

The POC could be downloaded at: <https://github.com/ProbeFuzzer/poc/blob/master/zziplib/zziplib_0-13-67_unzip-mem_memory-alignment-errors_zzip_disk_findfirst_64.zip>

master/src/zzip/mmapped.c:444:25: runtime error: load of misaligned address 0x7f798f31e163 for type 'uint64\_t', which requires 8 byte alignment

0x7f798f31e163: note: pointer points here
