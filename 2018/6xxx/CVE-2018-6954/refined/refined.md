Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2018-6954:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how `systemd-tmpfiles` handles symlinks within non-terminal path components during file creation and permission setting. When processing a path such as `/var/lib/foo/bar`, and `/var/lib/foo` is a symlink, `systemd-tmpfiles` would follow the symlink, effectively operating on `target_of_symlink/bar` rather than the intended `/var/lib/foo/bar`.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Symlink Following in Non-Terminal Components:** `systemd-tmpfiles` followed symlinks in path components other than the last one, leading to operations being performed on unintended locations.
*   **O_NOFOLLOW bypass:** The `O_NOFOLLOW` flag used with `open()` system call did not prevent following symlinks in parent directories.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Ownership:** A local attacker could exploit this flaw to gain ownership of arbitrary files by manipulating the path and inserting symlinks. The attacker could create a directory, place files within that directory, then replace the directory with a symlink pointing to a sensitive location. When tmpfiles processes this path it would operate on files in the sensitive location instead of in the intended directory. This would allow the attacker to modify the permissions of these files to escalate privileges.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a local attacker who has the ability to create files and directories within paths processed by systemd-tmpfiles.
*   **tmpfiles.d Configuration:** The attacker can leverage tmpfiles.d configuration to specify the target locations, as well as creating a directory, placing files within that directory, then replacing the directory with a symlink pointing to a sensitive location.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Access:** The attacker must have local user access to the system.
*   **File System Manipulation:** The attacker needs the ability to create files, directories, and symlinks in locations that are processed by `systemd-tmpfiles`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content from the GitHub pull request #8822 shows the patch that was created to remediate CVE-2018-6954
*   The fix involves using the `chase_symlinks()` function, which recursively calls `openat()` starting from root, and also includes a new `CHASE_NOFOLLOW` flag to prevent following symlinks. This ensures all components of path are resolved and checked securely without following symlinks.
*   The fix was backported to multiple versions of Ubuntu and SUSE as detailed in the provided content.
*   The vulnerability could be triggered even with `fs.protected_symlinks` sysctl turned on.
*   The issue was initially discovered and discussed in GitHub issue #7986.
*   The vulnerability could lead to privilege escalation.
*   The issue also had a partial fix in systemd v239, but only for some "Z" type entries. The full fix was available in systemd v240.

**In Summary:**

CVE-2018-6954 was a critical symlink vulnerability in `systemd-tmpfiles` that allowed a local attacker to gain ownership of arbitrary files by manipulating symlinks in the path, leading to potential privilege escalation. This was resolved by enhancing how systemd-tmpfiles handles paths with symlinks, by not following symlinks and using the `chase_symlinks()` function.
