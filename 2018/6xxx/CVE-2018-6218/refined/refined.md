Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6218:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a DLL hijacking issue. When a vulnerable Trend Micro product is installed and another application's installer is executed, the Trend Micro product can inadvertently load a malicious DLL from the directory where the other application's installer is located.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **DLL Hijacking (CWE-427):** The core issue is that the vulnerable Trend Micro products improperly load DLLs, leading to the loading of arbitrary DLLs from untrusted locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the user running the other application's installer. This could lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have some level of access to the target system. This is done when another application installer is running on the target system, while a vulnerable Trend Micro product is installed.
*   **Malicious DLL Placement:** The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL within a directory where the other application's installer is run.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local System Access:** The attacker must have some level of local access to the target system, specifically the ability to place files (the malicious DLL) in locations where the other application's installer would access them.
*  **User Interaction:** The attack requires the user to execute the installer of another application.

**Affected Products:**

The following Trend Micro products are listed as affected:
*   Virus Buster Corporate Edition 11
*   Virus Buster Corporate Edition XG
*   Virus Buster Business Security 9.5
*   Virus Buster Business Security Service
*   Trend Micro Endpoint Sensor 1.6
*   Trend Micro Deep Security 10.0
*   Virus Buster Cloud (including monthly versions)

**Mitigation:**

*   Apply the patches provided by Trend Micro.

**CVSS Metrics:**

*   **CVSS v3:** 7.8 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
*   **CVSS v2:** 6.8 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)
