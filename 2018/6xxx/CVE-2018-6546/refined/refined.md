{
  "cve": "CVE-2018-6546",
  "description": "The “plays_service.exe” Windows service allows for the unauthenticated execution of a user-provided path at SYSTEM privilege. An HTTP message with the “execute_installer” parameter does not securely authenticate the user before executing the provided path. The vulnerability could allow for privilege escalation on the current system or remote compromise on an internal network by executing a file over SMB.",
  "affected_products": [
    "Plays.tv 1.27.5.0 and prior versions"
  ],
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The “plays_service.exe” Windows service does not properly authenticate user-supplied paths before executing them with SYSTEM privileges.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unauthenticated access to a critical function",
      "Direct execution of user-supplied paths",
      "Missing security checks before executing the path"
    ],
    "impact": "Privilege escalation to SYSTEM and potentially remote code execution on an internal network",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Unauthenticated HTTP request to the plays_service.exe",
        "Exploitation over SMB network shares"
      ],
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable service and know the port where the service is running. For remote exploitation, the attacker needs access to an SMB share within the target network."
  },
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerable software was previously included in AMD’s driver installation packages and is still distributed with its legacy products as part of its Gaming Evolved program. The service binds to an ephemeral port which can be determined from the registry."
