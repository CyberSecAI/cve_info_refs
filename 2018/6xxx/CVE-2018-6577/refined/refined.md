Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user input within the Joomla! component JEXTN Membership, specifically in the `usr_plan` parameter when processing user subscriptions. This allows an attacker to inject SQL commands directly into the database query.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core vulnerability is an SQL Injection (SQLi). The application is not properly escaping or validating user-supplied data before incorporating it into the SQL query.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the underlying database. This can lead to:
    *   Data exfiltration: The attacker can steal sensitive data stored in the database, such as usernames, passwords, personal details of users, and other confidential information.
    *   Data modification: The attacker can alter or delete data in the database.
    *   Privilege escalation: The attacker might be able to gain administrative access to the application by manipulating user roles or creating new admin accounts.
    *   Full system compromise: In some scenarios, it might be possible to execute operating system commands via database functionalities (e.g., via stored procedures) if the database user has sufficient permissions or if the SQL server has enabled `xp_cmdshell` or other similar features, although this particular exploit doesn't seem to try that.
    *   Denial of Service: An attacker can potentially cause database errors that can crash or severely impact application performance.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to `http://localhost/index.php?option=com_jemembership&view=myplans&task=myplans.usersubscriptions`, specifically by injecting SQL code within the `usr_plan` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to have the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the target Joomla! site. The attacker does not need to have prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability as the vulnerability is in a parameter that can be submitted through the post data of a request.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit code demonstrates how to inject a SQL payload into the `usr_plan` parameter. This payload is crafted to extract the database user, database name, and database version.
*   The exploit code is intended for a vulnerable version 3.1.0 of the JEXTN Membership component for Joomla!
*   The `N/A` in the CVE field of the exploit code is incorrect as this exploit does relate to CVE-2018-6577.
