Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6519:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a regular expression used in the SAML2 library to validate and parse timestamps (`xs:DateTime`). This regex lacks limits on the number of digits allowed in the fraction of seconds part of the timestamp.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS):** The unbounded regex allows an attacker to inject an extremely long sequence of digits in the fractional seconds part of a timestamp. This causes the regex engine to consume excessive CPU time while processing the malformed timestamp.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending specially crafted SAML messages containing timestamps with excessive fractional seconds digits, an attacker can cause the SimpleSAMLphp application to become unresponsive due to the high resource consumption while evaluating the regex.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **SAML Message Injection:** The attacker needs to be able to inject a malformed SAML message containing the vulnerable timestamp.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to send SAML messages to a vulnerable SimpleSAMLphp instance. This could involve being a user of the application or an entity in the same federation.
- The attacker does not need to have valid credentials for the system and doesn't necessarily need to be authenticated, as the vulnerability lies in the parsing of timestamps which occur prior to full message verification.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability affects all SimpleSAMLphp SAML2 library versions prior to specific fixes (1.10.4, 2.3.5 and 3.1.1).
- The vulnerability was discovered during a security audit by Cure53.
