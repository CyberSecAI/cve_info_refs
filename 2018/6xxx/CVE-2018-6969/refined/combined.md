##### 3. Problem Description

**VMware Tools Shared Folders out-of-bounds read vulnerability**

VMware Tools for Windows contains an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the Shared Folders feature. Successful exploitation of this issue may lead to information disclosure or may allow attackers to escalate their privileges on the guest VMs.

Note: In order to be able to exploit this issue, Shared Folders feature must be enabled. This issue only affects Windows VMs running on VMware Workstation or Fusion. Products that do not allow the Shared Folders feature to be enabled are not affected.

VMware would like to thank Anurudh for reporting this issue to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the identifier CVE-2018-6969 to this issue.

Before you can identify which folders to share or mirror, you must configure your virtual machine to share folders.

## Procedure

1. Select Window > Virtual Machine Library.
2. Select a virtual machine in the Virtual Machine Library window and click Settings.
3. Under Systems Settings in the Settings window, click Sharing.
4. Select the Enable Shared Folders check box.

   This action enables shared folders. It also enables mirrored folders for supported Windows guest operating systems. On Windows and macOS virtual machines, a VMware Shared Folders shortcut is created on the guest operating system. Click on the shortcut to view the shared folders.

**Parent topic:**
[Sharing Files Between Windows and Your Mac](GUID-6F5059DD-5449-4820-AAE8-F541C229AEDE.html "You can set up shared folders in guest operating systems to share files between your Mac and your Windows and other virtual machines.")

book
#### Article ID: 317687

calendar\_today
#### Updated On:

#### Products

VMware vSphere ESXi

Show More
Show Less

#### Issue/Introduction

Symptoms:
VMware has been made aware of issues in some vSphere ESXi 6.5 configurations with the VMXNET3 network driver for Windows that was released with VMware Tools 10.3.0.
As a result, VMware has recalled the VMware Tools 10.3.0 release. This release has been removed from the VMware Downloads page.

#### Cause

In certain configurations, the VMXNET3 driver released with VMware Tools 10.3.0 can result in a Purple Diagnostic Screen (PSOD) or guest network connectivity loss.

#### Resolution

Due to the severity of issues identified in the VMXNET3 driver released with VMware Tools 10.3.0, VMware has recalled this release and it is no longer available for download.

Action is required if you have deployed VMware Tools 10.3.0 and all of the following are true:

* vSphere ESXi 6.5 hosts
* VM Hardware Version 13
* Windows 8/Windows Server 2012 or higher guest OS

If this is the case, then VMware recommends upgrading to VMware Tools 10.3.2 immediately.
If the above criteria are **not** met, VMware recommends upgrading to VMware Tools 10.3.2 during routine maintenance.
VMware Tools 10.3.2 is available from the [VMware Downloads](https://customerconnect.vmware.com/web/vmware/details?downloadGroup=VMTOOLS1032&productId=742) page.

#### Additional Information

**Note:** If importing a VM with hardware version 13 from VMware Workstation/Fusion or via OVF to a vSphere ESXi 6.5 environment, ensure that VMware Tools 10.3.0 is not installed in that VM or immediately upgrade the VMware Tools version to 10.3.2.

Impact/Risks:
Potential ESXi host crash
