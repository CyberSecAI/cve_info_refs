```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is due to a flaw in how Chromium handles port blocking.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Incorrect handling of network ports, allowing for circumvention of port blocking mechanisms.
- Impact of exploitation: Attackers can bypass intended restrictions on network ports, potentially accessing services that should be blocked.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is triggered through network communication.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to influence the network requests made by the Chromium browser.
