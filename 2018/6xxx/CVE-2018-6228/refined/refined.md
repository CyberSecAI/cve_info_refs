```
{
  "CVE-2018-6228": {
    "Root cause": "The `hidEditId` parameter in `policies.jsp` is not sanitized before being used in a SQL query, allowing for SQL injection.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command [CWE-89]"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. In this specific PoC, a crafted query is used to bypass the intended access control and view sensitive data.",
    "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted POST request to `policies.jsp` with a malicious `hidEditId` parameter.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the web application. They would need to be authenticated to access the policies section, but this requirement can be bypassed by combining this with other vulnerabilities described in the report."
