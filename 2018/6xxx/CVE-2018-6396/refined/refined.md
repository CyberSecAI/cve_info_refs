Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Joomla! Component "Google Map Landkarten" version 4.2.3 and earlier is vulnerable to SQL injection. This is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `cid`, `id`, and `map` parameters when processing requests to `index.php`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The application directly incorporates user-provided data into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Information Disclosure:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, including schema details, table names, and potentially user credentials.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potentially):** While not explicitly stated, successful SQL injection could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution on the server in some cases if the attacker uses advanced techniques.
- **Data Modification/Deletion:**  An attacker could potentially modify or delete data within the application's database.
- **Compromise of application:** Full access to backend data and possibly full compromise of application and underlying server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Requests:** Vulnerable parameters are passed through the URL in HTTP GET requests.
- **Vulnerable URLs:**
    - `index.php?option=com_gmap&view=gm_markers&tmpl=component&layout=form_markers&cid=[SQL]&id=1&format=raw`
    - `index.php?option=com_gmap&view=gm_markers&tmpl=component&layout=form_markers&cid=1&id=[SQL]&format=raw`
    - `index.php?option=com_gmap&view=gm_modal&tmpl=component&layout=default&map=[SQL]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Joomla! instance.
- **No Authentication Needed:** The attack does not appear to require any specific authentication.
- **Basic SQL Injection Knowledge:** Attacker needs basic understanding of SQL injection techniques to craft malicious queries.
