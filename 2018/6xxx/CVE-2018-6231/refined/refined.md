**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-6231

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper validation of user-supplied strings during the parsing of the username at login. Specifically, the process fails to validate the username before using it in a system call.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The lack of proper input validation allows an attacker to inject malicious commands into the username field.
- **Authentication Bypass:** The vulnerability is exploitable without authentication, meaning a remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability directly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to escalate privileges to resources that are normally protected. This enables the attacker to gain control over the system.
- **Complete Compromise:** The CVSS score indicates a critical vulnerability with complete impact to Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
- **Login Interface:** The attack vector is through the login mechanism of the Trend Micro Smart Protection Server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable server.
- **No authentication:** The attacker does not require any pre-existing credentials to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in the handling of credentials provided at login.
- An update was released by Trend Micro to address the issue.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Alain Homewood of Insomnia Security.
