Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update for Desktop](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2018/01/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_24.html "Stable Channel Update for Desktop")

Wednesday, January 24, 2018

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 64 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux. This will roll out over the coming days/weeks.

Chrome 64.0.3282.119 contains a number of fixes and improvements -- a list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/63.0.3239.132..64.0.3282.119?pretty=fuller&n=10000). Watch out for upcoming [Chrome](https://chrome.blogspot.com/) and [Chromium](https://blog.chromium.org/) blog posts about new features and big efforts delivered in 64.

**Security Fixes and Rewards**

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [53](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M64+-component%3AOS&colspec=ID+Pri+M+Stars+ReleaseBlock+Component+Status+Owner+Summary+OS+Modified&x=m&y=releaseblock&cells=ids) security fixes.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[805285](https://crbug.com/805285)] Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives

This release contains additional mitigations against [speculative side-channel attack techniques](https://blog.google/topics/google-cloud/what-google-cloud-g-suite-and-chrome-customers-need-know-about-industry-wide-cpu-vulnerability/).

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer](https://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/undefinedbehaviorsanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity), [libFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer), or [AFL](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/).

Thank you,

Abdul Syed
