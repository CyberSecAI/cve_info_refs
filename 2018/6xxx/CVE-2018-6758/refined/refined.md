Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6758:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `uwsgi_expand_path` function within the `utils.c` file of the Unbit uWSGI application container server.
*   The function is susceptible to a stack-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `uwsgi_expand_path` function copies a directory path into a local buffer (`src`) without proper bounds checking. If the provided directory path (`dir`) exceeds the size of the local buffer (`PATH_MAX + 1`), it will overwrite adjacent data on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial-of-service (application crash):** A successful overflow can overwrite critical data on the stack, leading to an application crash.
*   **Stack corruption:** The overflow can corrupt the program's execution context, potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution (although this is not explicitly stated in the provided text, it is a common consequence of stack buffer overflows).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a directory path with a length greater than `PATH_MAX` to the `uwsgi_expand_path` function.
*   The specific way this function is used by uWSGI is not described in this text, but a large directory string would need to be provided as input to the function via the normal execution paths of uWSGI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to influence the directory path input to the `uwsgi_expand_path` function.
*   The attacker would need to have the ability to send a malicious request to the application that results in the `uwsgi_expand_path` function being called with a crafted input.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided commit message mentions "sanitize input, avoiding stack corruption and potential security issue", this confirms that the root cause of the issue was an unsanitized input leading to a stack buffer overflow.
*   The Debian Security Advisory (DLA 1275-1) confirms the vulnerability and its impact, and it mentions that this vulnerability is fixed in version 1.2.3+dfsg-5+deb7u2.
*   The vulnerable code snippet copies a `dir` argument into the stack buffer `src` using `memcpy` without validating its length, which confirms the stack buffer overflow vulnerability.
*   The fix appears to involve replacing the stack-allocated `src` with a dynamically allocated buffer created using `uwsgi_concat2n`. This is a common mitigation strategy to avoid stack overflows, and likely involved additional checks to ensure bounds are maintained.
