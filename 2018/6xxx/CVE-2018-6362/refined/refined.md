Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6362:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the `domainop` action parameter of the Easy Hosting Control Panel (EHCP).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS because it does not properly sanitize user input within the `action` parameter. Specifically, the provided payload demonstrates the ability to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Cookie Theft:** The provided example demonstrates reading the `PHPSESSID` cookie, which could allow an attacker to hijack a user's session.
* **Arbitrary Javascript Execution**:  More generally, successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities, including data theft, defacement, and other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable EHCP page, specifically targeting the `action` parameter within the `domainop` action. The payload is embedded in the URL itself.
  `http://127.0.0.1/ehcp/index.php?op=domainop&action=list%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3Ea`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Network Access:** The attacker only needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable EHCP instance. This implies a remote attack vector over the network.
* **No Privilege/Authentication:** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability as the injection point is directly accessible without login requirements.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided information contains more detail than the typical CVE description, including the vulnerable parameter, a PoC URL, and the vendor's response timeline.
* The vendor was notified, but did not issue a patch at the time of this public disclosure.
