- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application allows a malicious user to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into metadata tags, which are then executed when the frontend attempts to suggest tags.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization or proper encoding of user-supplied input (metadata tags) which is later rendered in the web application.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement of the web application, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker can inject malicious JavaScript by modifying the "Tags" parameter in a PUT request to the `/api/latest/vulnerabilityscans/tags/batch` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send PUT requests to the server with a modified JSON body that includes malicious JavaScript in the "Tags" parameter. The attacker would need access to the application and the ability to update metadata tags.
