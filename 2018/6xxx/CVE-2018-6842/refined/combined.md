|  | Issue title: Authenticated SQL Injection |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
|  | Description |
|  | Some pages in Kentico's administration interface built SQL queries from |
|  | user-controlled input in an unsafe manner. Users need specific permissions to |
|  | access these pages. However, potential attackers could trick an authenticated |
|  | user with sufficient permissions into clicking a malicious link in order to |
|  | achieve arbitrary SQL code execution. |
|  |  |
|  | Details |
|  | Vulnerability type: SQL injection |
|  | Security risk: Critical |
|  | Found in version(s): 10.0, 11.0 |
|  | Fixed in version: 10.0.50, 11.0.3 |
|  | Reported date: 09/Jan/18 |
|  | Fixed date: 12/Jan/18 |
|  | Reported by: Zakaria Amous (Secureworks) |
|  |  |
|  | Issue title: Authenticated Reflected Cross-Site Scripting |
|  |  |
|  | Description |
|  | User-controlled input was reflected back into a system page without proper |
|  | sanitization. Potential attackers could trick victims into visiting a malicious |
|  | link, which resulted in arbitrary JavaScript execution in the application's |
|  | context. |
|  |  |
|  | Details |
|  | Vulnerability type: Reflected Cross-site scripting (XSS) |
|  | Security risk: Major |
|  | Found in version(s): 10.0, 11.0 |
|  | Fixed in version: 10.0.50, 11.0.3 |
|  | Reported date: 09/Jan/18 |
|  | Fixed date: 12/Jan/18 |
|  | Reported by: Zakaria Amous (Secureworks) |
|  |  |
|  | Recommendation |
|  | Install the latest hotfix. You can download the latest hotfix from the Download section on the DevNet portal. |
