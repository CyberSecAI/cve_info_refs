{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the application accepting untrusted input in the `url` parameter of `redirector.php` without proper validation, leading to an open redirect.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards (CWE-601)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can craft malicious URLs that, when clicked, redirect users to a phishing site or other malicious content. This allows attackers to steal user credentials or conduct other harmful activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the `redirector.php` script, specifically the `url` parameter within the GET method. Attackers can either directly provide a malicious URL or provide a base64 encoded version of a malicious URL.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker only needs to be able to craft a URL with a malicious redirect and send it to a victim. No special position or user privilege is required."
