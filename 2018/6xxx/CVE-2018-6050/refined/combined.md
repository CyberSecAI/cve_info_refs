[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A0265)

## Topic

An update for chromium-browser is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Supplementary.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Chromium is an open-source web browser, powered by WebKit (Blink).

This update upgrades Chromium to version 64.0.3282.119.

Security Fix(es):

* Multiple flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web page containing malicious content could cause Chromium to crash, execute arbitrary code, or disclose sensitive information when visited by the victim. (CVE-2018-6031, CVE-2018-6032, CVE-2018-6033, CVE-2018-6034, CVE-2018-6035, CVE-2018-6036, CVE-2018-6037, CVE-2018-6038, CVE-2018-6039, CVE-2018-6040, CVE-2018-6041, CVE-2018-6042, CVE-2018-6043, CVE-2018-6045, CVE-2018-6046, CVE-2018-6047, CVE-2018-6048, CVE-2018-6049, CVE-2018-6050, CVE-2018-6051, CVE-2018-6052, CVE-2018-6053, CVE-2018-6054)
* To mitigate timing-based side-channel attacks similar to "Spectre" and "Meltdown", this update reduces the precision of the timing data provided by the Date object and the performance.now() API, and the V8 JavaScript engine now uses masking of certain addresses and array or string indices.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing the update, Chromium must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update for Desktop](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2018/01/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_24.html "Stable Channel Update for Desktop")

Wednesday, January 24, 2018

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 64 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux. This will roll out over the coming days/weeks.

Chrome 64.0.3282.119 contains a number of fixes and improvements -- a list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/63.0.3239.132..64.0.3282.119?pretty=fuller&n=10000). Watch out for upcoming [Chrome](https://chrome.blogspot.com/) and [Chromium](https://blog.chromium.org/) blog posts about new features and big efforts delivered in 64.

**Security Fixes and Rewards**

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but havenâ€™t yet fixed.

This update includes [53](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M64+-component%3AOS&colspec=ID+Pri+M+Stars+ReleaseBlock+Component+Status+Owner+Summary+OS+Modified&x=m&y=releaseblock&cells=ids) security fixes. Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chrome Security Page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[805285](https://crbug.com/805285)] Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives

This release contains additional mitigations against [speculative side-channel attack techniques](https://blog.google/topics/google-cloud/what-google-cloud-g-suite-and-chrome-customers-need-know-about-industry-wide-cpu-vulnerability/).

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer](https://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/undefinedbehaviorsanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity), [libFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer), or [AFL](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/).

Thank you,

Abdul Syed
