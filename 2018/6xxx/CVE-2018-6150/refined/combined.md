Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update for Desktop](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2018/04/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html "Stable Channel Update for Desktop")

Tuesday, April 17, 2018

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 66 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux. This will roll out over the coming days/weeks.

Chrome 66.0.3359.117 contains a number of fixes and improvements -- a list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/65.0.3325.181..66.0.3359.117?pretty=fuller&n=10000). Watch out for upcoming[Chrome](https://chrome.blogspot.com/) and[Chromium](https://blog.chromium.org/) blog posts about new features and big efforts delivered in 66.

**Site Isolation Trial**
Chrome 66 will include a small percentage trial of [Site Isolation](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/site-isolation), to prepare for a broader upcoming launch.  Site Isolation improves Chrome's security and [helps mitigate the risks posed by Spectre](https://security.googleblog.com/2018/01/todays-cpu-vulnerability-what-you-need.html).

To diagnose whether an issue is caused by Site Isolation, use chrome://flags#site-isolation-trial-opt-out as described [here](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/site-isolation#TOC-Diagnosing-Issues). Please [report](https://goo.gl/XBoKtY) any trial-specific issues to help us fix them before Site Isolation is launched more broadly.

**Security Fixes and Rewards**

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

Chrome 66 will not trust website certificates issued by Symantec's legacy PKI before June 1st 2016, continuing the phased distrust outlined in our [previous announcements](https://security.googleblog.com/2018/03/distrust-of-symantec-pki-immediate.html).

This update includes [62](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+os%3DAndroid%2Cios%2Clinux%2Cmac%2Cwindows%2Call+label%3ARelease-0-M66) security fixes. Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chrome Security Page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.
As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[833889](https://crbug.com/833889)] Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer](https://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/undefinedbehaviorsanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity), [libFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer), or [AFL](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/).
