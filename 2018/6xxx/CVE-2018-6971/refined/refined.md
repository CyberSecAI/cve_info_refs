Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-6971:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insecure logging of credentials within the `vmmsi.log` file during the installation of VMware Horizon View Agent. This occurs when an account other than the currently logged-on user is specified during the installation, including silent installations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability lies in the logging of sensitive credentials, specifically the username and password, within a log file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential Exposure:**  A low-privileged user could gain access to credentials used during the installation of the Horizon View Agent. This can lead to unauthorized access to systems or resources if the exposed credentials are for administrative or privileged accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local File Access:** An attacker would need to gain access to the local file system where the `vmmsi.log` file is stored.
- **Privilege Escalation (Potential):** While described as low-privileged access, if the exposed credentials are of higher privilege, this could lead to privilege escalation on the system, or other systems if the credentials are reused.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low-Privileged User:** An attacker would need to have low-privileged access to the system where the vulnerable Horizon View Agent is installed.
- **Access to Log Files:** The attacker needs access to the `vmmsi.log` file, typically found in a temporary directory or other locations depending on configuration, or collected logs.

**Additional Information:**
- The `vmmsi.log` file stores credentials in clear text
- The Horizon View Agent 7.5.1 upgrade attempts to remove these potentially vulnerable logs but may not be fully effective in all scenarios (such as changes in the temp directory or collection of logs by external tools).
- Manual cleanup of these log files might be necessary, detailed in KB56631.
