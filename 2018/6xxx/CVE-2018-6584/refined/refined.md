Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-6584

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL Injection vulnerability present in the 'id' parameter of the DT Register component for Joomla.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter before using it in a database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the application's database.
- This could lead to:
    - Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
    - Potential compromise of the entire database and the web application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable Joomla component.
- Specifically, the attacker manipulates the `id` parameter in the URL of the `com_dtregister` component.
  - Example: `http://localhost/[PATH]/index.php?option=com_dtregister&task=edit&controller=category&id=[SQL]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla application.
- No specific user privileges appear to be necessary to exploit the SQL injection, meaning that an unauthenticated attacker could exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit-db content includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) URL and a sample SQL injection payload.
- The vulnerable component is DT Register version 3.2.7.
- The Joomla Extensions Directory entry indicates the extension was unpublished due to "PE1", which likely refers to a security-related reason.
