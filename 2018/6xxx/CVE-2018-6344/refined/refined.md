Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2018-6344:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap corruption issue was discovered in WhatsApp's video conferencing implementation, which is based on the PJSIP library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability leads to crashes due to memory corruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- By fuzzing the RTP packets sent during a WhatsApp video call.
- The attacker needs to be able to initiate a video call with the target.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to call the target to exploit this.
- The attacker needs to be able to modify the packets sent during a video call. This was achieved by hooking the memcpy function used before encryption, which allowed manipulation of the unencrypted packet data.
- The attacker also needs knowledge of the video conferencing protocol to replay the altered packets correctly by modifying the SSRC values.
