Support time and options could be much better and the documentation is often in video form and often outdated.After having emailed with support on some issues it’s like they don’t understand what I am trying to say. Maybe it’s just me, but I keep getting the same answer over and over and when I complain about documentation they want me to give up my site credentials.Also getting mails on the same issue in new email threads.Happy enough with the app, but support need to step up – majorly. Or it’s just me.

I am delighted with the plugin and also using the Staff Cabinet AddOn. There is a large capacity of options and features. It needs some tweaks in some places, however, the possibilities are great. Thank you, and I do recommend this plugin if you need a booking system for your website.

Hi guys,
The biggest problem is that all Booking plugins just use default Georgian Calendar system.
I installed Parsi Date plugin for converting WP’s default Georgian Calendar to Jalali (Solar) Calendar. It works perfect but None of the WordPress Booking plugins display dates based on the solar calendar.I would like to ask if it is possible to create this coordination with the Parsi Date plugin so that the solar calendar is used as the default calendar.
Thank you very much.

Support time and options could be much better and the documentation is often in video form and often outdated.After having emailed with support on some issues it’s like they don’t understand what I am trying to say. Maybe it’s just me, but I keep getting the same answer over and over and when I complain about documentation they want me to give up my site credentials.Also getting mails on the same issue in new email threads.Happy enough with the app, but support need to step up – majorly. Or it’s just me.

I am delighted with the plugin and also using the Staff Cabinet AddOn. There is a large capacity of options and features. It needs some tweaks in some places, however, the possibilities are great. Thank you, and I do recommend this plugin if you need a booking system for your website.

Hi guys,
The biggest problem is that all Booking plugins just use default Georgian Calendar system.
I installed Parsi Date plugin for converting WP’s default Georgian Calendar to Jalali (Solar) Calendar. It works perfect but None of the WordPress Booking plugins display dates based on the solar calendar.I would like to ask if it is possible to create this coordination with the Parsi Date plugin so that the solar calendar is used as the default calendar.
Thank you very much.

# Bookly #1 WordPress Booking Plugin (Lite) 13.2 – Blind Stored XSS

February 9, 2018 · 1 min · 105 words · Luigi Gubello
### Info[#](#info)

**Product:** Bookly #1 WordPress Booking Plugin (Lite Version)
**Version:** 13.2
**Active installations:** 10,000+
**Product page:** <https://wordpress.org/plugins/bookly-responsive-appointment-booking-tool/>
**CVE:** [2018-6891](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-6891)

### Description[#](#description)

An unauthenticated user can inject arbitrary persistent javascript code in the admin panel.

### Proof of Concept[#](#proof-of-concept)

Bookly Lite 13.2 and Bookly Pro 14.5 are affected, probably even earlier versions.
*I think the problem is that jQuery.ajax request is not sanitized in **ng-payment\_details\_dialog.js**. [\*]*

**07/01/2018** - I send the report
**26/01/2018** - Bookly Lite is updated to version **14.5** and the vulnerability is fixed
**10/02/2018** - Public disclosure

*[\*] I have been very busy these days, so I could not read the code of the plug-in.*
