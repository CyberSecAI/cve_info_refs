Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6008:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization or validation in the `download_file` parameter of the `attachment` task within the `com_jtagmembersdirectory` component of Joomla. This allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary file path, leading to the disclosure of server-side files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Arbitrary File Download: The core vulnerability is an arbitrary file download, enabling unauthorized access to files on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Data Exposure: An attacker can download sensitive files from the server. This may include configuration files, database connection details, or other confidential data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET Request: The attack vector involves crafting a specific HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs network access to the Joomla website.
- Knowledge of the vulnerable component and parameter: The attacker needs to know about the vulnerable component `com_jtagmembersdirectory` and its `attachment` task and `download_file` parameter.

**Technical Details:**
The exploit is triggered by sending a request like this:

`http://localhost/[PATH]/index.php?option=com_jtagmembersdirectory&task=attachment&download_file=[FILE]`

Where `[PATH]` is the path to the Joomla installation and `[FILE]` is the path to the desired file on the server.

**Additional Notes:**
- The Joomla extension, `Jtag Members Directory 5.3.7`, was unpublished due to this vulnerability.
- The provided exploit information indicates that the vulnerability was tested on Windows and Linux systems.
