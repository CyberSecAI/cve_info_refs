- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of proper escaping in the module chromes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the module system, potentially leading to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting the user to a malicious website.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability is in the module chromes within the Joomla CMS. An attacker would likely need to find a way to insert malicious code, through module configuration or other means.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  An attacker would need to be able to influence the content of module chromes, either by being an admin or potentially through exploiting another vulnerability in the CMS.
