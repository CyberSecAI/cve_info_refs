##### 3. Problem Description

**a. VMware Horizon View Agent local information disclosure vulnerability**

VMware Horizon View Agents contain a local information disclosure vulnerability due to insecure logging of credentials in the vmmsi.log file when an account other than the currently logged on user is specified during installation (including silent installations). Successful exploitation of this issue may allow low privileged users access to the credentials specified during the Horizon View Agent installation.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the identifier CVE-2018-6971 to this issue.

Column 5 of the following table lists the action required to remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is available.

 [KB56631](http://kb.vmware.com/s/article/56631)

\*The Horizon View Agent 7.5.1 upgrade process will attempt to remove vmmsi.log files which may contain installation credentials. This process may not be effective if the temporary windows directory (%TEMP%) was changed after installation or if these logs have been collected by an external solution such as VMware vRealize Log Insight or a similar 3rd party product. Please see [KB56631](http://kb.vmware.com/s/article/56631) for more details on manual cleanup.

**b. ESXi, Workstation, and Fusion denial-of-service vulnerability**

VMware ESXi, Workstation, and Fusion contain a denial-of-service vulnerability due to NULL pointer dereference issue in RPC handler. Successful exploitation of this issue may allow attackers with normal user privileges to crash their VMs.

VMware would like to thank Hahna Latonick and Kevin Fujimoto working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative for reporting this issue to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the identifier CVE-2018-6972 to this issue.
