- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `/usernamepassword/login` endpoint of the Auth0 authentication service when the "Legacy Lock API" flag is enabled. After user credentials are verified, an HTML form is rendered into the user's browser and automatically executed. This form POSTs a JWT to the `/login/callback` endpoint. The lack of session binding for this form post makes it susceptible to CSRF.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability due to the lack of session binding on the form POST to `/login/callback`.

- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with valid credentials for an Auth0 tenant can obtain the vulnerable form, and then through social engineering or clickjacking, induce a victim's browser to execute the form. The victim's browser will establish a login session at the Auth0 tenant under the attacker's account. This means any actions the victim performs will be under the attacker's identity, and any information associated with those actions will be visible to the attacker. However, the attack does not allow privilege escalation.

- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs valid credentials for an Auth0 tenant and then uses techniques like social engineering or clickjacking to trick a victim's browser into executing the vulnerable HTML form.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have valid user credentials for the affected Auth0 tenant and be able to manipulate or influence a victim’s browser to submit the malicious form. The attacker does not need a position in the network infrastructure, but needs to deliver the malicious form to the victim and cause the victim’s browser to execute the crafted POST request.
