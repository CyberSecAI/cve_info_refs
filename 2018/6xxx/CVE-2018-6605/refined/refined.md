```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The Joomla! Component Zh BaiduMap 3.0.0.1 is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization in the `id` parameter of multiple functions.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL injection vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. This could compromise the entire database and potentially lead to full system compromise.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending specially crafted POST requests to the vulnerable application. Attackers can inject SQL commands through the 'id' parameter of the `getPlacemarkDetails`, `getPlacemarkHoverText`, `getPathHoverText`, and `getPathDetails` functions.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target application. No authentication is explicitly mentioned as required.
