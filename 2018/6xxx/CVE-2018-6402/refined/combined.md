## Meross MSS110 Vulnerability

The [Meross MSS110](https://www.amazon.com/meross-MSS110-Control-Occupies-ETL-Complied/dp/B074K3NFZQ) is a popular “smart plug” device currently available from Amazon, and the subject of a recent promotion (only $10!)

Having an [inherent](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-5081) [distrust](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-5650) of [Internet-of-Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirai_%28malware%29) devices, before I get to really trusting this thing I wanted to poke at it a bit. I began by setting it up on a throwaway segment of my WLAN, and plugging my Christmas tree into it. I then ran nmap against it:

```

```

Interestingly, as soon as I did this, my Christmas tree began turning itself on and off intermittently. I’m not sure how that’s related, but it’s worth noting. *(I later learned that this is because nmap is crashing the device)*

Seeing that port 80 was open, I also ran a Nikto scan against the webserver:

```

```

This also caused the lights to freak out. (As mentioned above, I eventually learned that this is also because Nikto is crashing the device, dumping its crash state to screen before the telnet connection closes):

```

I took a packet capture of a communications session between the mobile app and the device. Things look fairly normal here, communicating with an Amazon AWS host over what looks like TLS based on the presence of `0x17 0x03 0x03` at the [beginning](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-agl-tls-snapstart-00) of every TCP data segment:

I decided to do a bit of open-source research to see if I could find a copy of the binary firmware for the device. I wasn’t lucky enough to find this online, but I did find an .apk of the app for the device on the manufacturer’s website. Out of curiosity, I loaded this into an online decompiler and started to poke around. Wait, what’s in this “assets” folder?

![alt text](firmware.png "Decompiler")

What luck - the APK actually contains a copy of what looks like the firmware binary, presumably to facilitate firmware upgrades!

Let’s run a `file` and `binwalk` on this to see what we’re dealing with:

```
root@kali:~/Desktop# file mss110-us-v1-rc0118.bin
mss110-us-v1-rc0118.bin: u-boot legacy uImage, zxrouter, Linux/MIPS, Standalone Program (Not compressed), 733628 bytes, Sat Jan  6 08:46:07 2018, Load Address: 0x80500000, Entry Point: 0x80500000, Header CRC: 0xC2D49870, Data CRC: 0x51CE1F0F

root@kali:~/Desktop# binwalk mss110-us-v1-rc0118.bin

```

It looks like a U-boot image, along with some lzma-compressed data at a specific offset. Let’s carve that out using `dd` and see what we can find, and then decompress it using xzcat:

```
root@kali:~# dd if=mss110-us-v1-rc0118.bin bs=1 skip=9344 of=lzma.tar.lzma

```

We can then poke through strings to see what we might find:

```
root@kali:~# xzcat lzma.tar.lzma | strings | less

```

No obvious passwords in here, but there’s definitely some RSA keys, clues to how the device works, and other interesting nuggets:

```

#PROFILE
#VER_2_1
SYS_USERS=admin
SYS_USERS1=user
SYS_ADMPASS=
SYS_ADMPASS1=

```

Wait, what’s that last part? `SYS_USERS=admin`. Let’s go back and try and connect via telnet. The telnet listener doesn’t respond to the typical line endings, so we need to adjust our client to send proper ones (via [Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/322846/telnet-client-does-not-send-crlf-when-expected))

1. Start the Telnet Client.
2. Open a Telnet session to a Telnet server.
3. Press CTRL+] to switch to command mode.
4. Type set crlf.
5. Press ENTER to return to session mode.

Taking a random stab at a password, I tried “admin”, *blank*. Boom, it dumps me to a shell. Maybe I should have tried that to begin with:

```
root@kali:~# telnet 192.168.1.51
Trying 192.168.1.51...
Connected to 192.168.1.51.
Escape character is '^]'.
Login as:^]
telnet> set crlf
Will send carriage returns as telnet <CR><LF>.
^MInvalid User Name
Login as:admin^MPassword:^M
CFG>ls^Mget         set         del         prof

```

Upon an initial look, it doesn’t appear to be a full Bash shell, but it definitely exposes some inner workings of the system as well as some type of debug filesystem.

There’s risks here though - a tool located at `Meross/wifi` will dump the ESSID, WPA2 passphrase, and BSSID of the network it’s currently associated with. This isn’t a huge issue since we’re presumably connected to the LAN as well, but in case this device is internet-exposed or didn’t follow its configured 802.11 security settings, this could be a fairly severe risk.

![alt text](settings.png "Meross/wifi")

There’s also what appears to be part of a web-based admin interface exposed (`admin.htm`), though this doesn’t appear to be documented anywhere. Changing a password here does appear to change the Telnet password, though it would be nice if Meross advertised this functionality if it worked fully, allowing users to change the password to their device (or enable/disable Telnet).

### UPDATE as of 4/28/2018, firmware version 1.1.24

The telnet behavior described above was current as of firmware version 1.1.18, but appears to have been disabled in 1.1.24. However, the `admin.htm` administrative interface is still exposed and unauthenticated as of 1.1.24.

### Future work:

* Explore exposed shell, filesystem
* Carve, reverse engineer binaries
* Explore HTTP server further

### Tests Passed:

* Test behavior when presented with Wi-Fi network that doesn’t match stored security settings

Unlike another [device I’ve looked at](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-5650), the MSS110 appears to only connect to networks matching the WPA2 security settings of networks it knows. Other devices show this “fail open” behavior, which is incredibly dangerous when combined with a hardcoded root password.

Interestingly enough, my [ecobee 4](https://www.ecobee.com/) doesn’t do well at this - it will connect to a network with matching ESSID, but mismatched security settings. This resulted in the issuance of CVE-2018-6402:

`“Ecobee Ecobee4 4.2.0.171 devices can be forced to deauthenticate and connect to an unencrypted Wi-Fi network with the same SSID, even if the device settings specify use of encryption such as WPA2, as long as the competing network has a stronger signal. An attacker must be able to set up a nearby SSID, similar to an "Evil Twin" attack.”`
