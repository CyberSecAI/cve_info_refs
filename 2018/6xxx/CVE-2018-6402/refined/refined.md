The provided content includes information about CVE-2018-6402, as well as vulnerabilities discovered in a Meross MSS110 smart plug.

**CVE-2018-6402:**

*   **Root Cause:** The ecobee4 thermostat can be forced to connect to an unencrypted Wi-Fi network even when configured to use WPA2 encryption, if a nearby network with the same SSID has a stronger signal.
*   **Weaknesses:** The device prioritizes signal strength over configured security settings, allowing a downgrade attack to an insecure network.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can intercept and potentially manipulate network traffic of the compromised device, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or controlling the thermostat.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Setting up a rogue Wi-Fi access point with the same SSID as the legitimate network but without encryption.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must be within range to create a Wi-Fi network with a stronger signal than the legitimate network, and know the SSID of the targeted network.

**Meross MSS110 Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Root Cause:** The device has an exposed Telnet service with default credentials, and an unauthenticated web admin interface.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **Exposed Telnet Service:** Telnet port 23 is open and accessible.
    *   **Default Credentials:** Default username `admin` and blank password can be used to log in via telnet
    *   **Unauthenticated Web Interface:** An admin web interface (`admin.htm`) is exposed and can be accessed without authentication
    *   **Information Disclosure:** A tool located at `Meross/wifi` will dump the ESSID, WPA2 passphrase, and BSSID of the network itâ€™s currently associated with.
    *   **Device Crashing:** Nmap and Nikto scans are able to crash the device.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Full device control:** Attackers can gain shell access via Telnet with default credentials, allowing them to manipulate device settings or execute arbitrary commands.
    *   **Network credential theft:** Attackers can dump network configuration data (ESSID, passphrase) which could be used to attack other devices on the network.
    *   **Device Disruption:** Attackers can crash the device, causing it to become temporarily unavailable.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Telnet Access:** Direct connection to port 23 from the local network.
    *   **Web Interface:** Accessing the web server on port 80 and navigating to the admin page.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be on the same LAN as the device.
    *   For Telnet, knowledge of the default credentials.
    *   For the web interface, knowledge that the `admin.htm` page exists.

The content also provides steps to extract and analyze the firmware from the Meross device, including locating the firmware binary within the mobile app's APK file. The Telnet vulnerability was reported as fixed in later firmware versions, but the web interface vulnerability was still present.
