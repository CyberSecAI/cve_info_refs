Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6959:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how VMware vRealize Automation handles session IDs. Specifically, session tokens are not being renewed properly.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Missing renewal of session tokens, which leads to predictable or reusable session IDs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially hijack a valid vRealize Automation user's session. This could allow the attacker to perform actions with the privileges of the compromised user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker would need to obtain the session ID through some means, possibly by eavesdropping network traffic or social engineering techniques.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to obtain a valid session ID and use it before the legitimate user's session expires or the attacker's access is detected.
- The attacker does not need to be an authenticated user to exploit the vulnerability, they just need a valid session ID.
- The attacker could be on the same network or have a man-in-the-middle position.

**Affected Versions:**
- vRealize Automation versions 7.0.x, 7.1.x, 7.2.x, and 7.3.x are affected.
- vRealize Automation version 6.2.x is not affected.

**Resolution:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in vRealize Automation version 7.4.0
