  "ID": "CVE-2018-6211",
  "content": "The provided text discusses multiple vulnerabilities found in D-Link DIR-620 routers. Specifically, CVE-2018-6211 is described as an error that allows attackers to execute operating system commands through a URL parameter of the administration panel. \n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n- The root cause is an insecure implementation in the administration panel that does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in a URL parameter, thus enabling OS command injection.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- OS command injection vulnerability exists in the web interface of the router. This is due to insufficient input validation and sanitization of URL parameters within the administration panel.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- An attacker can execute arbitrary operating system commands on the router, allowing them to take control of the device and potentially compromise the network. This can lead to data theft, malware installation, or complete takeover of the router.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- The attack vector is through the router's web administration panel interface. The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious request containing an OS command within a specific URL parameter.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to reach the web administration panel of the router. This may require the device's administration panel to be exposed on the WAN interface, making it accessible from the internet. An unauthenticated attacker can trigger the vulnerability."
