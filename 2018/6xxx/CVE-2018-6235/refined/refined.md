- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when processing IOCTL 0x222814 by the `tmnciesc.sys` driver, leading to an out-of-bounds write.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write due to insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can escalate privileges to resources normally protected from the application.
- **Attack vectors:** Local attacker with the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to execute low-privileged code on the target system to exploit this vulnerability.
