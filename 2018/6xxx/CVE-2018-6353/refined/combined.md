## Description

[![@ghost](https://github.com/ghost.png?size=48)](/ghost)[ghost](/ghost)opened [on Jan 9, 2018](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/3678#issue-286955290)

wondering why it is currently possible to execute arbitrary system commands via python code through the electrum console, and why there is no whitelisting/blacklisting of allowed methods/functions as this seems like a major security issue

inserting a payload such as below in the console, then checking /tmp for the file creation shows the file was successfully created

> > lol=**import**('os');lol.system('/bin/sh -c "touch /tmp/test"');print(lol.path.isfile('/tmp/test'));
> >
> > True

This adds a warning about malicious code to the console window. It should help prevent users from executing code they found online.

## Screenshots

This warning is certainly hard to miss:

[![python_2018-01-12_00-08-25](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/598790/34852014-e36610f2-f72c-11e7-9892-4389501f5f8e.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/598790/34852014-e36610f2-f72c-11e7-9892-4389501f5f8e.png)

Clicking the message indeed hides it:

| Thanks for testing! I didn't find a way to automatically increase the size of the label based on the content size. However, I've enabled word wrapping and increased the height slightly so it should be at least better now. |

| Not sure about that. The console is seldom used so the benefit wouldn't be big. But users might forget that they disabled that warning. I'd rather have the warning after every restart. |

| No.  People forget.  I don‚Äôt mind that Facebook always greets me with a huge DONT PASTE STUFF HERE message.  As long as it doesn‚Äôt cover up server banners I say persist for the session until the GUI is closed |

| [@ecdsa](https://github.com/ecdsa) Do you mean clicking it once would hide it forever? It's very easy to click it even by mistake.  [@dabura667](https://github.com/dabura667) Well it covers up server banners somewhat (now more than on above screenshots). But I think the behaviour in the PR of "click it once, and it won't be shown until you re-open Electrum" is fine. |
