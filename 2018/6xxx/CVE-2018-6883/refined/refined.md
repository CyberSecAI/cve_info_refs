Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the Piwigo application. Specifically, the `tags` POST variable within the `admin/tags.php` file is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application uses the `addslashes()` function for sanitization, which is insufficient to prevent SQL injection. The injected value is not enclosed in quotes within the SQL query, which enables attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The `tags`, `edit_list` and `merge_list` POST parameters are vulnerable due to inadequate sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation can lead to full information disclosure, allowing attackers to access sensitive data from the database including user credentials.
*   **Potential for further attacks:** By obtaining database access, attackers could potentially modify or delete data, or use the database as a springboard to further compromise the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote exploitation:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely through HTTP requests.
*   **POST requests:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a specially crafted POST request to the `/admin.php?page=tags` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Admin Privileges:** Attackers must have valid administrator credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Piwigo instance.
*  **Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter:** The attacker must know the `tags` POST variable is vulnerable.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable files are `admin/tags.php` and the vulnerable parameters are `tags`, `edit_list` and `merge_list`.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how an attacker can extract user password hashes using a crafted SQL injection payload.
*   The issue was addressed in version 2.9.3 by introducing further input sanitization to only accept integers.
*   The vulnerability is rated as a moderate severity with a CVSS score of 4.9
*   This vulnerability was also assigned CVE-2017-16893 for the `edit_list` parameter.
