## Description

[![@lorenzodifuccia](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22743521?u=9d3357d38a37db01d03cbdcd418db68e2df822eb&v=4&size=48)](/lorenzodifuccia)[lorenzodifuccia](https://github.com/lorenzodifuccia)opened [on Jan 18, 2018](https://github.com/sshipway/routers2/issues/1#issue-289787686)

During a security test I found that *routers2.cgi* has a **Cross-Site Scripting** (XSS) vulnerability, affecting the `rtr` GET parameter in the request below. This may enable attackers to inject malicious scripts into client browser.

`http://www.steveshipway.org/cgi-bin/routers2.pl?rtr=--><script>alert("XSS")</script>&bars=Cami&xgtype=d&page=graph&xgstyle=l2&xmtype=routers`

[![XSS Evidence 01](https://github.com/lorenzodifuccia/cloudflare/raw/master/Images/vulns/routers2.cgi/routers2cgi_XSS_01.png "XSS Evidence 01")](https://github.com/lorenzodifuccia/cloudflare/raw/master/Images/vulns/routers2.cgi/routers2cgi_XSS_01.png)

## [XSS Evidence 02](https://github.com/lorenzodifuccia/cloudflare/raw/master/Images/vulns/routers2.cgi/routers2cgi_XSS_02.png)

Cause:

[`print "<!-- R:[$router]\n I:[$interface]\n A:[$archive]\n U:[$authuser] -->\n";`](https://github.com/sshipway/routers2/blob/master/routers2.cgi.pl#L1565)

All the params returned in the HTML should be escaped.

ROUTERS.CGI  : Frontend to RRDTool databases created by MRTG
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Author: Steve Shipway (steve@steveshipway.org)

Note: if you are experiencing problems with running routers.cgi, take a look
      at the PROBLEMS file for more help. It's in the doc directory.

      If you want help using a particular feature, check the doc/HOWTO file.

      If you want help installing, look at the doc/INSTALL file

      If you want to know about MRTG file directives, look at the doc/MRTG_INFO
      file.

      If you want to know about configuring routers.cgi, then look at
      the doc/ROUTERS_CONF file.

      If you are upgrading, and want to know the new features and bug fixes,
      then take a look at the doc/UPGRADING and CHANGES files.

Acknowledgement:
      The SNMP_Session.pm, SNMP_util.pm and BER.pm files accompanying this
      package are not created by myself.  They are as distributed with the
      current MRTG release from Tobi Oeticker, and contain their own
      attribution.  They are not required for the routers.cgi package to run,
      they are used only by the targetnames.pl script.

Quick Install
-------------
For more details, look at doc/INSTALL.  However, if you just want to go for it,
then run the Perl script install.pl and follow the prompts.

Summary
-------
This package consists of a single Perl CGI script, and a number of GIF
images.  Both the images and script need to be accessible from your web
browser in order for the package to work.  In addition there is a setup
script, a script to help configure your .conf file, and an addin script
to give routing tape information.

This gives a new, forms-enhanced frontend for the RRDTool databases.  It is
intended to replace the '14all.cgi' script shipped with RRDTool and MRTG,
for certain applications.

What it does
------------
It generates some compact, fairly good-looking frames-based pages to act as
frontends for the router statistics collected by MRTG and held in the RRDTool
databases, as configured in the MRTG .conf files.  Although highly configurable,
it is designed to work with minimum configuration using AI code to take
reasonable defaults for most options.

What it does not do
-------------------
It will not work with MRTG .log files.  It will not work with other RRDTool
databases not created by MRTG.
It will not collect the data, it will only display it (except in the case
of the routingtable addin).

What it looks like
------------------
Hopefully, there will be links to demo pages from the main website, on
<http://www.steveshipway.org/software/>

Why does it do/not do this?
---------------------------
I wanted a frontend that was user-friendly and easy to move to.  A more
general frontend would necessarily be more complex to configure, and would
not be so user-friendly (if you want something like this, see the excellent
Cricket frontend).
I found that 90% of the statistics I needed access to were for routers,
collected by the MRTG software.  So, making the appropriate assumptions, I
found I could use the existing MRTG configuration files and save on unnecessary
work.

How does it decide what names to give routers and interfaces?
-------------------------------------------------------------
Device names are chosen in this order of preference:
1. The [targetnames] section of the routers.conf files, using the .conf file
   name as a key (without the path) (deprecated)
2. The old [routerdesc] section of the routers.conf file, using the name in 4.
   below as a key.  This is now deprecated.
3. The first ShortDesc[] directive for the first target in the MRTG .conf file
4. The first word of the first Title[] line in the MRTG .conf file
5. The filename containing the data

Target Long descriptions -
1. [targettitles] section of routers2.conf (deprecated)
2. routers.cgi*Description[xxxx]: xxxxx
3. Title[xxxx]: xxxxx

Target Short descriptions -
1. [targetnames] section of routers2.conf (deprecated)
2. routers.cgi*ShortDesc[xxx]: xxxxxxx
3. SetEnv[xxxx]: MRTG_INT_DESC="xxxxxx"
4. If ifdefault=target is set in routers2.conf [targetnames] section, or
   ifdefault is undefined, then use IP Address, Interface desc, #interface
   number, or the target name itself (in that order)
5. If ifdefault=cfgmaker is set in routers2.conf [targetnames] section, then
   use the PageTop section defined by cfgmaker to find and use PortName,
   Description, or IfName (in that order)
6. If a MRTG .ok file exists with an entry for this target's interface, then
   the description associated with that interface.
7. Use the long description, possibly truncated to the first word or the first
   word after the last colon if it contains a colon.

Router group names are set as:
1. The [targetnames] section of the routers.conf, using the full directory
   name as a key (case sensitive, NT users should add the drive letter if it
   is specified in the confpath directive)
2. The last component of the directory name, often with a trailing /

95th Percentile Calculations
----------------------------
In brief, they are inaccurate, and this cannot be corrected.
The 95th Percentile is a weighted Median average.  Simply put, it is the
minimum value that the sample set remains below 95% of the time.  A true
Median average could also be thought of as the 50th Percentile.
Unfortunately the RRDTool databases work on a Mean average.  As the sample
interval increases (ie, you move from Daily graphs to Weekly graphs, and so
on) you will smooth out the data.  This results in a lower 95th Percentile
number than it should be.  This is unavoidable because of the lossy nature
of the RRDTool databases - they summarise in order to save space.  Sadly this
summarising is not compatible with the calculation of the 95th Percentile.
So, if you want a more meaningful 95th Percentile, look at the daily graphs,
where the samples are averaged only over 5min intervals.
Other ways to get more meaningful 95th Percentile numbers are to decrease
the sample interval to 1min, and to double the RRA length of the RRD files
(you can do this with the rrdextend.pl script in the extras directory).
The new v1.3 of RRDtool has built-in support for accurate 95th Percentile
calculations, if you manually add an extra RRA to the database.  Routers2
does not yet take advantage of this, though.

Routing Tables
--------------
If you set the appropriate option in the routers.conf file, then a new link
will appear on the 'info' page giving the router's routing table.  However,
for this to work you must:
* Install Net::SNMP on your server
* Install the routingtable.cgi script
* Make sure your routers will allow this server to make SNMP queries
* Uncomment the option in the routers.conf
In addition, the MIME multipart support in IE4 and IE5 is broken, and does not
usually work correctly.  It's OK with Netscape though!  The script detects
the existance of IE, and disables the server push update, so it works but is
not so pretty.

Grouping of routers
-------------------
This feature is disabled by default, but you can switch it on in the
routers.conf file.  When enabled, the routers are grouped according to the
directory in which their correcponding MRTG .cfg file lives.  You can define
files in more than one directory by having multiple entries on the 'cfgfiles'
directive, eg:
cfgfiles = dir1/*.cfg dir2/*.cfg
and so on.  You can set a better description for these groups by making an
entry in the [targetnames] section of the routers.conf file.
See the HOWTO file for more detailson this feature.

Timezones
---------
Support for different timezones is patchy, due to O/S problems.  Basically,
under UNIX you will find the Timezone[] directive mostly works, although
you may need to use a more specific syntax.  Under Windows, it is more
difficult and you may not be able to place routers into different timezones,
nor will you be able to show graphs relative to any timezone but the one the
server lives in (this can be overridden on a GLOBAL basis in the routers.conf
file).  See the HOWTO for more information.  Note that MRTG under Windows can
cope better with Timezones than RRDTool as it uses a different (better) C
compiler for the library.  Sadly we are stuck with the current RRDTool
library limitations with timezones.

Trend Analysis
--------------
To do this, you need to install the trend.cgi script in the extensions
directory into your cgi-bin.  Full instructions are given in the accompanying
documentation.  You need to add directives to your MRTG .cfg files to link
this script in as an extension to the various targets.

Which MRTG .cfg file directives are supported?
----------------------------------------------
See the file MRTG_INFO for a complete list.

I have a few ideas...
---------------------
If they are relating to MRTG or RRDTool, then send them to Tobi Oetiker (the
author of RRDTool).  For this frontend, then by all means email me.  I'd like
to know if anyone else is using this.

There's a bug!
--------------
If you find a bug, or something that doesn't work in your setup, then remember
that this is a work in progress.  Email me and let me know how/if you fixed it,
and what you think should be done to correct it.  All bug reports are read,
and discussion happens on the mailing list.  So far, most bugs have been
fixed very soon after reporting.
There is a discussion forum and bug reporting centre on steveshipway.org:
<http://www.steveshipway.org/forum>
The mailing list currently lives on steveshipway.org, to join go to the URL
<http://www.steveshipway.org/support>

More information
----------------
There is a book available, _Using MRTG with RRDtool and Routers2_.  This gives
detailed information on planning, setting up, configuring and tuning your
MRTG system.  See <http://www.steveshipway.org/book/> for more details.

Saying Thanks
-------------
If you want to thank me for giving away this software, then there is an easy
way to do it - send me a DVD or similar gift from my Amazon wishlist.
See the page on
<http://www.steveshipway.org/software/wishlist.html>
for more details on how to show your appreciation.
Also, Tobi (who of course produced MRTG and RRDTool) has a similar scheme
for his DVD collection, and you could do worse than sending him a gift as well.

Legal Jargon
------------

In summary, you can use it, copy it, modify it and give it away, but not
sell it or any derivative work.  More precisely, see the following GPL

##### About The Exploit Database

√ó

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as ‚ÄúGoogle Hacking‚Äù was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny‚Äôs talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term ‚ÄúGoogledork‚Äù to refer
to ‚Äúa foolish or inept person as revealed by Google‚Äú. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a ‚ÄúGoogle problem‚Äù but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term ‚Äúdork‚Äù became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and ‚Äúdorks‚Äù were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
