Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-6193

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `routers2.cgi.pl` script fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `rtr` GET parameter, before including it in the generated HTML output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application reflects the unsanitized `rtr` parameter directly back to the user in the HTML response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Script Injection:** Attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web page. This malicious script can then be executed in the victim's browser, potentially leading to:
  - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing cookies to impersonate the victim.
  - **Phishing:** Redirecting the user to a malicious login page.
  - **Defacement:** Altering the content of the web page.
  - **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting to a site hosting malicious files.
  - **Information theft:** Stealing sensitive information from the user

**Attack Vectors:**
- **GET Request Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL with a specially crafted `rtr` parameter containing the JavaScript payload.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker may need to trick the victim into clicking the crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs and distribute them to potential victims (e.g. via social media, email, or other web pages).
- No special access to the target server is required.

**Additional Information from Exploit-DB:**
- The vulnerability affects `routers2.cgi` version 2.24.
- The vulnerable parameter is 'rtr' in a page=graph action.
- The solution suggested is to update the program from the GitHub repository or disable the 'paranoia' setting in the `routers2.conf` file.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code snippet is identified as: `print "<!-- R:[$router]\n I:[$interface]\n A:[$archive]\n U:[$authuser] -->\n";` in `routers2.cgi.pl`, where parameters are printed without proper escaping.
