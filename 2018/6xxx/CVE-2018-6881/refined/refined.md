The provided content describes path disclosure vulnerabilities in DedeCMS 5.7 and EmpireCMS.

**DedeCMS 5.7 Path Disclosure**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by direct access to certain include files that trigger errors, revealing the full server path. Specifically, the `helper()` function is called in `include/downmix.inc.php` without being defined, causing a fatal error that discloses the path. Similarly, in `/dede/inc/inc_archives_functions.php`, the use of undefined constant `DEDEINC` and a subsequent `require_once` call results in a warning and fatal error that discloses the path.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Direct access to include files.
    *   Use of undefined functions and constants that lead to errors.
    *   Lack of proper error handling to prevent path disclosure.
*   **Impact:** Web site physical path leakage, which can be used to discover more vulnerabilities in the system.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Direct HTTP requests to specific include files:
    *   `http://127.0.0.1/include/downmix.inc.php`
    *   `http://127.0.0.1/dede/inc/inc_archives_functions.php`
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Any remote user can trigger the vulnerability by accessing these URLs.

**EmpireCMS Path Disclosure**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by passing an array as a parameter to the `htmlspecialchars()` and `addslashes()` functions, which are expected to receive a string. This causes a PHP error that discloses the full server path.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Improper input validation and sanitization on the parameters being passed to `htmlspecialchars()` and `addslashes()`.
    *   Lack of proper error handling to prevent path disclosure.
*  **Impact:** Web site physical path leakage, which can be used to discover more vulnerabilities in the system.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Directly accessing the following URLs with array values for the specified parameters:
    *   EmpireCMS 6.6:
        *   `http://domain/e/admin/tool/ShowPic.php?url[]=kongxin&pic_height[]=kongxin&pic_width[]=kongxin&picurl[]=kongxin&`
       *   `http://domain/e/action/ListInfo.php?totalnum[]=kongxin&page[]=kongxin&myorder[]=kongxin&orderby[]=kongxin&andor[]=kongxin&ph[]=kongxin&tempid[]=kongxin&line[]=kongxin&endtime[]=kongxin&starttime[]=kongxin&ztid[]=kongxin&ttid[]=kongxin&classid[]=kongxin&mid[]=kongxin&`
    *   EmpireCMS 7.0:
        *   `http://domain/e/admin/ecmseditor/infoeditor/epage/TranMore.php?InstanceName[]=kongxin&sinfo[]=kongxin&modtype[]=kongxin&infoid[]=kongxin&filepass[]=kongxin&classid[]=kongxin&showmod[]=kongxin&`
    *   EmpireCMS 7.2:
        *    `http://domain/e/data/ecmseditor/infoeditor/epage/TranFile.php?filesize[]=kongxin&fname[]=kongxin&InstanceName[]=kongxin&filepass[]=kongxin&classid[]=kongxin&type[]=kongxin&showmod[]=kongxin&`
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Any remote user can trigger the vulnerability by accessing these URLs.
