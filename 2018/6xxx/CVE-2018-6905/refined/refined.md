Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2018-6905:

**Vulnerability:** Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Affected Software:** TYPO3 v9.1.0

**Root Cause:** The provided content doesn't detail the specific root cause of the XSS vulnerability. However, it indicates the presence of a persistent XSS vulnerability in TYPO3 v9.1.0

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is a persistent XSS. This means the malicious script is stored on the server (likely in the database) and executed every time a user views the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a TYPO3 website.
- When a user visits the page containing the injected code, the script executes within their browser.
- This can lead to a variety of malicious actions, including:
  - Stealing user session cookies.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Defacing website content.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
- Because it's persistent, the XSS will affect all users who access the vulnerable area of the site until the malicious code is removed

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker would likely need to find an input field or area in TYPO3 where they could inject malicious code. This could be a content editor, a form, or other user-controlled data input.
- Once the script is injected, it's stored persistently. The stored script is served to other users accessing the vulnerable part of the website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would likely need to be authenticated to inject the XSS. Depending on the vulnerability, the attacker might need elevated privileges like that of an editor or administrator. The exact requirements would depend on the specifics of the vulnerable component within TYPO3 v9.1.0.
