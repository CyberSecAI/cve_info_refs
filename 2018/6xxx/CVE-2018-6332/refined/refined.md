Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2018-6332
*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the Proxygen server's handling of invalid HTTP2 settings. Specifically, the server can be forced to spend excessive resources when processing these invalid settings.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The core issue is the disproportionate resource consumption triggered by crafted HTTP2 settings.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** The server can be overwhelmed, leading to a denial of service due to the resources spent processing invalid input.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit can lead to a denial of service.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through sending specially crafted, invalid HTTP2 settings to the Proxygen server.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP2 requests to the vulnerable HHVM server. No special capabilities appear to be required, aside from being able to craft the malicious HTTP2 settings.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects all supported versions of HHVM (3.24.3 and 3.21.7 and below) when using the Proxygen server to handle HTTP2 requests.
*   The fix was included in HHVM versions 3.25, 3.24.4, and 3.21.8.
