The provided content discusses two attacks related to Trusted Platform Module (TPM) power management, but it **does not** contain information about a vulnerability with the ID CVE-2018-6622.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The paper discusses two distinct vulnerabilities:
1.  A design flaw in the TPM 2.0 specification for the Static Root of Trust for Measurement (SRTM).
2.  An implementation flaw in tboot, a measured launch environment used with Intel's Trusted Execution Technology.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  The TPM 2.0 specification design flaw allows an attacker to reset and forge platform configuration registers, which are used to securely hold software measurements for bootstrapping the computer.
2.  The tboot implementation flaw also allows an attacker to reset and forge these critical registers.

**Impact of exploitation:**
 Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows an adversary to forge the measurements of software used during the boot process. This effectively bypasses the security provided by the TPM. The paper highlights the SRTM attack as particularly severe because its countermeasure requires hardware-specific firmware patches which take time to develop and apply to a vast number of devices.

**Attack vectors:**
 The attacks are related to power management within the TPM. The specific methods of exploitation are not detailed in the abstract, but the attacks involve manipulating the power management aspects of the TPM during the boot process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
 The attacker needs physical access to the device and the capability to manipulate the power management aspects of the TPM during the boot process. This means the attacker would need to be present before the device boots up and the OS takes over.

**Additional notes:**
 The paper mentions that the attacks are demonstrated with commodity hardware, suggesting they are not specific to rare or niche devices. The attacks are presented as a significant threat to platform integrity protection, given the widespread use of TPM-based security measures.
