```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a use-after-free error in `Vp9HeaderParser` when processing VP9 video frames. The `Vp9HeaderParser::SetFrame` function does not properly update the internal pointer (`frame_`) when the underlying buffer is reallocated, leading to a dangling pointer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-After-Free (UAF)",
      "Improper handling of memory allocation/reallocation"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to a crash due to accessing freed memory, which could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by providing a crafted WebM file with a specific sequence of VP9 encoded frames that causes a reallocation of the internal buffer during parsing.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a maliciously crafted WebM file to the vulnerable application."
