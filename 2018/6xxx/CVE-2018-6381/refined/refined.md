{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an incorrect handling of malformed ZIP files within the zziplib library.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The `zzip_disk_fread` function in `src/zzip/mmapped.c` does not properly validate the size of data to be copied, leading to a buffer overflow.",
      "Specifically, the `size` variable can be larger than the allocated memory (`file->stored`), causing `memcpy` to write beyond the buffer's boundary."
    ],
    "impact": "Exploitation can lead to a denial of service (application crash) or, potentially, arbitrary code execution.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "A specially crafted ZIP file designed to trigger the vulnerability is opened by a user or an automated system.",
        "The vulnerability is triggered through the `zzip_disk_fread` function when reading the crafted ZIP file."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "The attacker needs to be able to provide or trick a user or system into opening a malicious ZIP archive."
    ],
     "additional_information": "The vulnerability is triggered because the size of data copied by `memcpy` is not checked against the allocated buffer size (`file->stored`)."
