- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The component is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `id` parameter within the `getPlacemarkDetails` function.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - SQL Injection: The application directly uses the `id` parameter in a SQL query without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Database Exposure: An attacker can extract sensitive data from the database, potentially including usernames, passwords, and other confidential information.
    - Data Manipulation: An attacker could modify or delete data within the database.
    - Complete compromise: In some cases, if the database user has sufficient privileges the system could be fully compromised.

- **Attack vectors:**
    - HTTP POST request to `index.php?option=com_zhyandexmap&no_html=1&format=raw&task=getPlacemarkDetails`
    - Malicious SQL code injected into the `id` parameter.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla! instance.
    - No authentication required as the exploit targets the `id` parameter, which is directly used in the SQL query within `getPlacemarkDetails` function.
