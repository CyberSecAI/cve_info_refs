Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-6618

**Vulnerable Product:** Easy Hosting Control Panel (EHCP) v0.37.12.b

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the application storing database user passwords in cleartext within the `mysqlusers` table.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Password Storage:** The primary vulnerability is the storage of sensitive password data in an unencrypted format. This makes it easily readable to anyone with access to the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:**  Attackers who gain access to the system (e.g., via a compromised server) can directly read database user passwords from the database.
- **Database Compromise:**  Knowing the database passwords allows attackers to potentially compromise the databases themselves, leading to data breaches, data modification or deletion, and further access into the hosted web applications.
- **Lateral Movement:** If database credentials are reused across different services, this vulnerability could enable further access to other systems or applications.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by attackers who have local access to the database server. 

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Database Access:** The attacker needs to have access to the MariaDB database where EHCP stores its information. This might mean being a user on the system where EHCP is installed, a user with access to the database or have compromised access by some other vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of Database Structure:** The attacker needs to know the table name `mysqlusers` where passwords are being stored.

**Additional Details:**
- The advisory provides a specific SQL query (`select * from mysqlusers;`) demonstrating how an attacker can retrieve the cleartext passwords.
- The vulnerability was reported and acknowledged by the vendor, with a subsequent fix, but the timeline shows a lack of timely patching from the vendor.
- The issue was publicly disclosed after the vendor failed to address the issue within a 90 day period.
