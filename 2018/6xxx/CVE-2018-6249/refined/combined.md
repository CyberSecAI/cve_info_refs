# USN-3662-1: NVIDIA graphics drivers vulnerabilities

29 May 2018

NVIDIA graphics drivers could be made to crash or run programs as an
administrator.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [nvidia-graphics-drivers-384](/security/cves?package=nvidia-graphics-drivers-384) - NVIDIA binary X.Org driver

## Details

It was discovered that the NVIDIA graphics drivers contained flaws in the

kernel mode layer. A local attacker could use these issues to cause a

denial of service or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.

CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/[AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:U/RL:O/RC:C](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:U/RL:O/RC:C)

#### CVE-2018-6251

NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver contains a vulnerability in the DirectX 10 Usermode driver, where a specially crafted pixel shader can cause writing to unallocated memory, leading to denial of service or potential code execution.

CVSS Base Score: 7.0
CVSS Temporal Score: 6.3

CVSS Base Score: 6.5
CVSS Temporal Score: 5.9
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/[AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C)

#### CVE-2018-6253

NVIDIA GPU Display Driver contains a vulnerability in the DirectX and OpenGL Usermode drivers where a specially crafted pixel shader can cause infinite recursion leading to denial of service.

CVSS Base Score: 5.5
CVSS Temporal Score: 5.0
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/[AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C)
