Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6361:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Easy Hosting Control Panel (EHCP) v0.37.12.b does not properly sanitize user input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Although the description mentions XSS, the primary vulnerability described is the injection of a backdoor FTP account. This suggests that the lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious input that creates an FTP account. This can be done by manipulating the `op` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Backdoor FTP Account Creation:** Attackers can create arbitrary FTP accounts with chosen usernames and passwords.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** The created FTP accounts can then be used by the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP request with a malicious value for the `op` parameter.
*   **Remote Attack:** The attack can be performed remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable EHCP server. No prior access or authentication appears to be required.

**Additional Details:**
