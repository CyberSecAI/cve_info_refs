Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The Claymore Dual GPU Miner version 10.5 and below contains a format string vulnerability within its JSON listener on port 3333.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Format String Vulnerability:** The application improperly handles format specifiers within the `method` parameter of the JSON request, allowing an attacker to inject format string specifiers like `%s`, `%x`, `%p`, and `%n`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending the format specifier `%n`, an attacker can immediately terminate the mining process, causing a denial of service.
- **Memory Disclosure:** The attacker can use format specifiers like `%s`, `%x`, and `%p` to read memory addresses, potentially gaining information about the program's state and internals.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** Sending a crafted JSON request to the vulnerable service running on port 3333.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the machine running the vulnerable Claymore miner on port 3333.
- **Unauthenticated:** The vulnerability is exploitable without any prior authentication.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported on 01/26/18 and patched in version 10.6, released shortly after confirmation.
- The original report suggests that while memory addresses could be leaked, there might be potential for further exploitation through the stack using format string vulnerabilities.
