Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6951:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `patch` utility incorrectly handles certain inputs, specifically related to rename and copy operations within a patch file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Incorrect Input Handling:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation when processing patch files, specifically when handling rename or copy operations. The tool fails to ensure that two valid filenames are present during such operations.
*   **Potential Null Pointer Dereference:** The bug report for the related crash indicates that a null pointer dereference occurs in `src/patch.c` when parsing a crafted patch file. Specifically, the function `intuit_diff_type` is affected.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can craft a malicious patch file that, when processed by `patch`, will cause the program to crash leading to a denial of service. This is consistent with the Ubuntu Security Notice, which states: "It was discovered that Patch incorrectly handled certain inputs. An attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service."

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious Patch File:** The attacker would need to supply a specifically crafted patch file to the vulnerable `patch` utility. This patch file would contain malformed rename or copy instructions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to provide the malformed patch file to be processed by the `patch` utility. This could be via local execution, or another application that utilizes patch functionality.

**Additional details:**

*   The fix for this issue involves ensuring that two filenames are always present when a rename or copy operation is performed in the patch file, specifically within the `intuit_diff_type` function.
*   The vulnerability was triggered by a crafted patch file (named `segfault.patch`), which lead to a null pointer dereference during string comparison (`strcmp`).

This information is consistent with the CVE description.
