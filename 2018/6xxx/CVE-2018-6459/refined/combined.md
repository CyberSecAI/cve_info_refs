Signature Authentication in the Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2)

Abstract

   The Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) protocol has limited
   support for the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).
   The current version only includes support for three Elliptic Curve
   groups, and there is a fixed hash algorithm tied to each group.  This
   document generalizes IKEv2 signature support to allow any signature
   method supported by PKIX and also adds signature hash algorithm
   negotiation.  This is a generic mechanism and is not limited to
   ECDSA; it can also be used with other signature algorithms.

[1](#section-1).  Introduction

   This document adds a new IKEv2 [[RFC7296](/doc/html/rfc7296 "\"Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2)\"")] authentication method to
   support signature methods in a more general way.  The current
   signature-based authentication methods in IKEv2 are per algorithm,
   i.e., there is one for RSA digital signatures, one for DSS digital
   signatures (using SHA-1), and three for different ECDSA curves, each
   tied to exactly one hash algorithm.  This design is cumbersome when
   more signature algorithms, hash algorithms, and elliptic curves need
   to be supported:

[RFC 7427](/doc/html/rfc7427)            Signature Authentication in IKEv2       January 2015

   o  In IKEv2, authentication using RSA digital signatures calls for
      padding based on RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5, although the newer RSASSA-PSS
      padding method is now recommended.  (See [Section 5](#section-5) of "Additional
      Algorithms and Identifiers for RSA Cryptography for use in PKIX
      Profile" [[RFC4055](/doc/html/rfc4055 "\"Additional Algorithms and Identifiers for RSA Cryptography for use in the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile\"")].)

   o  With ECDSA and the Digital Signature Standard (DSS), there is no
      way to extract the hash algorithm from the signature.  Thus, for
      each new hash function to be supported with ECDSA or DSA, new
      authentication methods would be needed.  Support for new hash
      functions is particularly needed for DSS, because the current
      restriction to SHA-1 limits its security, meaning there is no
      point of using long keys with SHA-1.

   o  The tying of ECDSA authentication methods to particular elliptic
      curve groups requires definition of additional methods for each
      new group.  The combination of new ECDSA groups and hash functions
      will cause the number of required authentication methods to become
      unmanageable.  Furthermore, the restriction of ECDSA
      authentication to a specific group is inconsistent with the
      approach taken with DSS.

   With the selection of SHA-3, it might be possible that a signature
   method can be used with either SHA-3 or SHA-2.  This means that a new
   mechanism for negotiating the hash algorithm for a signature
   algorithm is needed.

   This document specifies two things:

   1.  A new authentication method that includes enough information
       inside the Authentication payload data so the signature hash
       algorithm can be extracted (see [Section 3](#section-3)).

   2.  A method to indicate supported signature hash algorithms (see
       [Section 4](#section-4)).  This allows the peer to know which hash algorithms
       are supported by the other end and use one of them (provided one
       is allowed by policy).  There is no requirement to actually
       negotiate one common hash algorithm, as different hash algorithms
       can be used in different directions if needed.

   The new digital signature method is flexible enough to include all
   current signature methods (RSA, DSA, ECDSA, RSASSA-PSS, etc.) and add
   new methods (ECGDSA, ElGamal, etc.) in the future.  To support this
   flexibility, the signature algorithm is specified in the same way
   that PKIX [[RFC5280](/doc/html/rfc5280 "\"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile\"")] specifies the signature of the Digital
   Certificate, by placing a simple ASN.1 object before the actual
   signature data.  This ASN.1 object contains an OID specifying the
   algorithm and associated parameters.  When an IKEv2 implementation

```

```

[RFC 7427](/doc/html/rfc7427)            Signature Authentication in IKEv2       January 2015

   supports a fixed set of signature methods with commonly used
   parameters, it is acceptable for the implementation to treat the
   ASN.1 object as a binary blob that can be compared against the fixed
   set of known values.  IKEv2 implementations can also parse the ASN.1
   and extract the signature algorithm and associated parameters.

[2](#section-2).  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [[RFC2119](/doc/html/rfc2119 "\"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels\"")].

[3](#section-3).  Authentication Payload

   This document specifies a new "Digital Signature" authentication
   method.  This method can be used with any type of signature.  As the
   authentication methods are not negotiated in IKEv2, the peer is only
   allowed to use this authentication method if the Notify payload of
   type SIGNATURE_HASH_ALGORITHMS has been sent and received by each
   peer.

   In this authentication method, the Authentication Data field inside
   the Authentication payload does not just include the signature value,
   as do other existing IKEv2 Authentication payloads.  Instead, the
   signature value is prefixed with an ASN.1 object indicating the
   algorithm used to generate the signature.  The ASN.1 object contains
   the algorithm identification OID, which identifies both the signature
   algorithm and the hash used when calculating the signature.  In
   addition to the OID, the ASN.1 object can contain optional parameters
   that might be needed for algorithms such as RSASSA-PSS (see
   [Section 8.1 of [RFC3447]](/doc/html/rfc3447#section-8.1)).

   To make implementations easier, the ASN.1 object is prefixed by the
   8-bit length field.  This length field allows simple implementations
   to know the length of the ASN.1 object without the need to parse it,
   so they can use it as a binary blob to be compared against known
   signature algorithm ASN.1 objects.  Thus, simple implementations may
   not need to be able to parse or generate ASN.1 objects.  See
   [Appendix A](#appendix-A) for commonly used ASN.1 objects.

   The ASN.1 used here is the same ASN.1 used in the AlgorithmIdentifier
   of PKIX (see [Section 4.1.1.2 of [RFC5280]](/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.1.1.2)), encoded using
   distinguished encoding rules (DER) [[CCITT.X690.2002](#ref-CCITT.X690.2002)].  The algorithm
   OID inside the ASN.1 specifies the signature algorithm and the hash
   function, both of which are needed for signature verification.

   Currently, only the RSASSA-PSS signature algorithm uses the optional
   parameters.  For other signature algorithms, the parameters are

```

[RFC 7427](/doc/html/rfc7427)            Signature Authentication in IKEv2       January 2015

   either NULL or missing.  Note that for some algorithms there are two
   possible ASN.1 encodings, one with optional parameters included but
   set to NULL and the other where the optional parameters are omitted.
   These dual encodings exist because of the way those algorithms are
   specified.  When encoding the ASN.1, implementations SHOULD use the
   preferred format called for by the algorithm specification.  If the
   algorithm specification says "preferredPresent", then the parameters
   object needs to be present, although it will be NULL if no parameters
   are specified.  If the algorithm specification says
   "preferredAbsent", then the entire optional parameters object is
   missing.

   The Authentication payload is defined in IKEv2 as follows:

         the AlgorithmIdentifier ASN.1 object.

      *  Signature Value (variable length) - This field contains the
         actual signature value.

      There is no padding between the ASN.1 object and the signature
      value.  For hash truncation, the method specified in ANSI
      X9.62:2005 [[X9.62](#ref-X9.62 "\"Public Key Cryptography for the Financial Services Industry: The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)\"")] MUST be used.

[4](#section-4).  Hash Algorithm Notification

   The supported hash algorithms that can be used for the signature
   algorithms are indicated with a Notify payload of type
   SIGNATURE_HASH_ALGORITHMS sent inside the IKE_SA_INIT exchange.

   This notification also implicitly indicates support of the new
   "Digital Signature" algorithm method, as well as the list of hash
   functions supported by the sending peer.

   Both ends send their list of supported hash algorithms.  When
   calculating the digital signature, a peer MUST pick one algorithm
   sent by the other peer.  Note that different algorithms can be used
   in different directions.  The algorithm OID indicating the selected
   hash algorithm (and signature algorithm) used when calculating the
   signature is sent inside the Authentication Data field of the
   Authentication payload (with Auth Method of "Digital Signature" as
   defined above).

   The Notify payload format is defined in [Section 3.10 of [RFC7296]](/doc/html/rfc7296#section-3.10).
   When a Notify payload of type SIGNATURE_HASH_ALGORITHMS is sent, the
   Protocol ID field is set to 0, the SPI Size is set to 0, and the
   Notify Message Type is set to 16431.

   The Notification Data field contains the list of 16-bit hash
   algorithm identifiers from the Hash Algorithm Identifiers of IANA's
   "Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) Parameters" registry.  There
   is no padding between the hash algorithm identifiers.

[5](#section-5).  Selecting the Public Key Algorithm

   This specification does not provide a way for the peers to indicate
   the public/private key pair types they have.  This raises the
   question of how the responder selects a public/private key pair type
   that the initiator supports.  This information can be found by
   several methods.

   One method to signal the key the initiator wants the responder to use
   is to indicate that in the IDr (Identification - Responder) payload
   of the IKE_AUTH request sent by the initiator.  In this case, the
   initiator indicates that it wants the responder to use a particular
   public/private key pair by sending an IDr payload that indicates that
   information.  In this case, the responder has different identities
   configured, with each of those identities associated to a public/
   private key or key type.

   Another method to ascertain the key the initiator wants the responder
   to use is through a Certificate Request payload sent by the
   initiator.  For example, the initiator could indicate in the

Kivinen & Snyder             Standards Track                    [Page 7]
```

---

```

[RFC 7427](/doc/html/rfc7427)            Signature Authentication in IKEv2       January 2015

   Certificate Request payload that it trusts a certificate authority
   certificate signed by an ECDSA key.  This indication implies that the
   initiator can process ECDSA signatures, which means that the
   responder can safely use ECDSA keys when authenticating.

   A third method is for the responder to check the key type used by the
   initiator and use the same key type that the initiator used.  This
   method does not work if the initiator is using shared secret or
   Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) authentication (i.e., is not
   using public keys).  If the initiator is using public key
   authentication, this method is the best way for the responder to
   ascertain the type of key the initiator supports.

   If the initiator uses a public key type that the responder does not
   support, the responder replies with a Notify message with error type
   AUTHENTICATION_FAILED.  If the initiator has multiple different keys,
   it may try a different key (and perhaps a different key type) until
   it finds a key that the other end accepts.  The initiator can also
   use the Certificate Request payload sent by the responder to help
   decide which public key should be tried.  In normal cases, when the
   initiator has multiple public keys, out-of-band configuration is used
   to select a public key for each connection.

[6](#section-6).  Security Considerations

   Tables 2 and 3 of the "Recommendations for Key Management"
   [[NIST800-57](#ref-NIST800-57)] give recommendations for how to select suitable hash
   functions for the signature.

   This new digital signature method does not tie the Elliptic Curve to
   a specific hash function, which was done in the old IKEv2 ECDSA
   methods.  This means it is possible to mix different security levels.
   For example, it is possible to use a 512-bit Elliptic Curve with
   SHA1.  This means that the security of the authentication method is
   the security of the weakest component (signature algorithm, hash
   algorithm, or curve).  This complicates the security analysis of the
   system.

   IKEv2 peers have a series of policy databases (see [Section 4.4 of
   [RFC4301]](/doc/html/rfc4301#section-4.4)) that define which security algorithms and methods should
   be used during establishment of security associations.  To help end
   users select the desired security levels for communications protected
   by IPsec, implementers may wish to provide a mechanism in the IKE
   policy databases to limit the mixing of security levels or to
   restrict combinations of protocols.

   Security downgrade attacks, where more secure methods are deleted or
   modified from a payload by a man-in-the-middle to force lower levels

Kivinen & Snyder             Standards Track                    [Page 8]

```

[RFC 7427](/doc/html/rfc7427)            Signature Authentication in IKEv2       January 2015

   of security, are not a significant concern in IKEv2 Authentication
   payloads, as discussed in this RFC.  This is because a modified AUTH
   payload will be detected when the peer computes a signature over the
   IKE messages.

   One specific class of downgrade attacks requires selection of
   catastrophically weak ciphers.  In this type of attack, the man-in-
   the-middle attacker is able to "break" the cryptography in real time.
   This type of downgrade attack should be blocked by policy regarding
   cipher algorithm selection, as discussed above.

   The hash algorithm registry does not include MD5 as a supported hash
   algorithm, as it is not considered safe enough for signature use
   [[WY05](#ref-WY05 "\"How to break MD5 and other hash functions\"")].

   The current IKEv2 protocol uses RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5, which has known
   security vulnerabilities [[KA08](#ref-KA08 "\"Variants of Bleichenbacher's Low-Exponent Attack on PKCS#1 RSA Signatures\"")] [[ME01](#ref-ME01 "\"Evaluation of Security Level of Cryptography: RSA-OAEP, RSA-PSS, RSA Signature\"")] and does not allow using newer
   padding methods such as RSASSA-PSS.  The new method described in this
   RFC allows the use of other padding methods.

   The current IKEv2 protocol only allows use of normal DSA with SHA-1,
   which means the security of the authentication is limited to the
   security of SHA-1.  This new method allows using longer keys and
   longer hashes with DSA.

[7](#section-7).  IANA Considerations

   This document creates a new IANA registry for IKEv2 Hash Algorithms.
   Changes and additions to this registry are by Expert Review
   [[RFC5226](/doc/html/rfc5226)].

   The initial values of this registry are:

   Hash Algorithm                       Value
   --------------                       -----
   RESERVED                             0
   SHA1                                 1
   SHA2-256                             2
   SHA2-384                             3
   SHA2-512                             4

   MD5 is not included in the hash algorithm list, as it is not
   considered safe enough for signature hash uses.

   Values 5-1023 are Unassigned.  Values 1024-65535 are reserved for
   Private Use among mutually consenting parties.

[RFC 7427](/doc/html/rfc7427)            Signature Authentication in IKEv2       January 2015

   This specification also adds a new value for
   SIGNATURE_HASH_ALGORITHMS (16431) to the "IKEv2 Notify Message Types
   - Status Types" registry and adds a new value for Digital Signature
   (14) to the "IKEv2 Authentication Method" registry.

[Appendix A](#appendix-A).  Commonly Used ASN.1 Objects

   This section lists commonly used ASN.1 objects in binary form.  This
   section is not normative, and these values should only be used as
   examples.  If the ASN.1 object listed in [Appendix A](#appendix-A) and the ASN.1
   object specified by the algorithm differ, then the algorithm
   specification must be used.  These values are taken from "New ASN.1
   Modules for the Public Key Infrastructure Using X.509 (PKIX)"
   [[RFC5912](/doc/html/rfc5912 "\"New ASN.1 Modules for the Public Key Infrastructure Using X.509 (PKIX)\"")].

[A.1](#appendix-A.1).  PKCS#1 1.5 RSA Encryption

   The algorithm identifiers here include several different ASN.1
   objects with different hash algorithms.  This document only includes
   the commonly used ones, i.e., the ones using SHA-1 or SHA-2 as the
   hash function.  Some other algorithms (such as MD2 and MD5) are not
   safe enough to be used as signature hash algorithms and are omitted.
   The IANA registry does not have code points for these other
   algorithms with RSA Encryption.  Note that there are no optional
   parameters in any of these algorithm identifiers, but all included
   here need NULL optional parameters present in the ASN.1.

[Appendix B](#appendix-B).  IKEv2 Payload Example

[B.1](#appendix-B.1).  sha1WithRSAEncryption

   The IKEv2 AUTH payload would start like this:

   00000000: NN00 00LL 0e00 0000 0f30 0d06 092a 8648
   00000010: 86f7 0d01 0105 0500 ....

   Where the NN will be the next payload type (i.e., the value depends
   on the next payload after this Authentication payload), the LL will
   be the length of this payload, and after the sha1WithRSAEncryption
   ASN.1 block (15 bytes) there will be the actual signature, which is
   omitted here.

* [strongSwan Vulnerability (CVE-2018-6459)](/blog/2018/02/19/strongswan-vulnerability-%28cve-2018-6459%29.html)

## strongSwan Vulnerability (CVE-2018-6459)

Feb 19, 2018

A denial-of-service vulnerability in the parser for RSASSA-PSS signatures was discovered in strongSwan 5.6.1.

[5.6.x](/blog/tags/5.6.x)[security fix](/blog/tags/security%2Bfix)

Our [fuzzer](https://wiki.strongswan.org/projects/strongswan/wiki/Fuzzing) on Google's [OSS-Fuzz infrastructure](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz) revealed a bug in the parser for PKCS#1 RSASSA-PSS signature parameters introduced with 5.6.1 that may lead to a denial-of-service attack.

### Insufficient Input Validation in RSASSA-PSS Signature Parser

Incorrectly encoded or crafted RSASSA-PSS signature values may cause a crash while parsing. Potential triggers are signatures in certificates, but also signatures used for IKEv2 signature authentication ([RFC 7427](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7427)). Affected is strongSwan 5.6.1.

[CVE-2018-6459](https://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2018-6459) has been assigned for this vulnerability.

ASN.1 encoded algorithm identifier structures for RSASSA-PSS signatures ([RFC 8017](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8017)) contain parameters that specify details, like hash algorithms and the salt length, used to create/verify the signatures. One of the configurable parameters is the mask generation function (MGF). Currently, only MGF1 is specified for this purpose. However, this in turn takes itself a parameter that specifies the underlying hash function. strongSwan's parser did not correctly handle the case of this parameter being absent, causing an undefined data read that results in a potential denial-of-service vulnerability.  Whether it actually causes a crash depends on the data on the stack at the time of parsing the MGF1 algorithm identifier.

Remote code execution is not possible due to this issue.

Credit to OSS-Fuzz for finding this vulnerability.

### Fix

The just released [strongSwan 5.6.2](/blog/2018/02/19/strongswan-5.6.2-released.html) fixes this vulnerability. For 5.6.1 we also [provide a patch](https://download.strongswan.org/security/CVE-2018-6459/) that fixes it.

An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available.
Description:
This update for strongswan fixes the following issues:
Strongswan was updated to version 5.8.2 (jsc#SLE-11370).
Security issue fixed:
- CVE-2018-6459: Fixed a DoS vulnerability in the parser for PKCS#1
RSASSA-PSS signatures that was caused by insufficient input validation
(bsc#1079548).
Full changelogs:
Version 5.8.2
\* Identity-based CA constraints, which enforce that the certificate
chain of the remote peer contains a CA certificate with a specific
identity, are supported via vici/swanctl.conf. This is similar to the
existing CA constraints but doesn't require that the CA certificate is
locally installed, for instance, intermediate CA certificates received
from the peers. Wildcard identity matching (e.g. ..., OU=Research,
CN=\*) could also be used for the latter but requires trust in the
intermediate CAs to only issue certificates with legitimate subject
DNs (e.g. the "Sales" CA must not issue certificates with
OU=Research). With the new constraint that's not necessary as long as
a path length basic constraint (--pathlen for pki --issue) prevents
intermediate CAs from issuing further intermediate CAs.
\* Intermediate CA certificates may now be sent in hash-and-URL encoding
by configuring a base URL for the parent CA (#3234,
swanctl/rw-hash-and-url-multi-level).
\* Implemented NIST SP-800-90A Deterministic Random Bit Generator (DRBG)
based on AES-CTR and SHA2-HMAC modes. Currently used by the gmp and
ntru plugins.
\* Random nonces sent in an OCSP requests are now expected in the
corresponding OCSP responses.
\* The kernel-netlink plugin now ignores deprecated IPv6 addresses for
MOBIKE. Whether temporary
or permanent IPv6 addresses are included now depends on the
charon.prefer\_temporary\_addrs setting (#3192).
\* Extended Sequence Numbers (ESN) are configured via PF\_KEY if supported
by the kernel.
\* The PF\_KEY socket's receive buffer in the kernel-pfkey plugin is now
cleared before sending requests, as many of the messages sent by the
kernel are sent as broadcasts to all PF\_KEY sockets. This is an issue
if an external tool is used to manage SAs/policies unrelated to IPsec
(#3225).
\* The vici plugin now uses unique section names for CHILD\_SAs in
child-updown events (7c74ce9190).
\* For individually deleted CHILD\_SAs (in particular for IKEv1) the vici
child-updown event now includes more information about the CHILD\_SAs
such as traffic statistics (#3198).
\* Custom loggers are correctly re-registered if log levels are changed
via stroke loglevel (#3182).
\* Avoid lockups during startup on low entropy systems when using OpenSSL
1.1.1 (095a2c2eac).
\* Instead of failing later when setting a key, creating HMACs via
openssl plugin now fails instantly if the underlying hash algorithm
isn't supported (e.g. MD5 in FIPS-mode) so fallbacks to other plugins
work properly (#3284).
\* Exponents of RSA keys read from TPM 2.0 via SAPI are correctly
converted (8ee1242f1438).
\* Routing table IDs > 255 are supported for custom routes on Linux.
\* To avoid races, the check for hardware offloading support in the
kernel-netlink plugin is performed during initialization of the plugin
(a605452c03).
\* The D-Bus config file for charon-nm is now installed in
$(datadir)/dbus-1/system.d instead of $(sysconfdir)/dbus-1/system.d,
which is intended for sysadmin overrides. INVALID\_MAJOR\_VERSION
notifies are now correctly sent in messages of the same exchange type
and with the same message ID as the request.
\* IKEv2 SAs are now immediately destroyed when sending or receiving
INVALID\_SYNTAX notifies in authenticated messages.
\* For developers working from the repository the configure script now
aborts if GNU gperf is not found.
Version 5.8.1
\* RDNs in DNs of X.509 certificates can now optionally be matched less
strict. The global strongswan.conf option charon.rdn\_matching takes
two alternative values that cause the matching algorithm to either
ignore the order of matched RDNs (reordered) or additionally (relaxed)
accept DNs that contain more RDNs than configured (unmatched RDNs are
treated like wildcard matches).
\* The updown plugin now passes the same interface to the script that is
also used for the automatically installed routes, that is, the
interface over which the peer is reached instead of the interface on
which the local address is found (#3095).
\* TPM 2.0 contexts are now protected by a mutex to prevent issues if
multiple IKE\_SAs use the same private key concurrently (4b25885025).
\* Do a rekey check after the third QM message was received (#3060).
\* If available, explicit\_bzero() is now used as memwipe() instead of our
own implementation.
\* An .editorconfig file has been added, mainly so Github shows files
with proper indentation (68346b6962).
\* The internal certificate of the load-tester plugin has been modified
so it can again be used as end-entity cert with 5.6.3 and later
(#3139).
\* The maximum data length of received COOKIE notifies (64 bytes) is now
enforced (#3160).
Version 5.8.0
\* The systemd service units have been renamed. The modern unit, which
was called strongswan-swanctl, is now called strongswan (the previous
name is configured as alias in the unit, for which a symlink is
created when the unit is enabled). The legacy unit is now called
strongswan-starter.
\* Support for XFRM interfaces (available since Linux 4.19) has been
added, which are intended to replace VTI devices (they are similar but
offer several advantages, for instance, they are not bound to an
address or address family).
\* IPsec SAs and policies are associated with such interfaces via
interface IDs that can be configured in swanctl.conf (dynamic IDs may
optionally be allocated for each SA and even direction). It's possible
to use separate interfaces for in- and outbound traffic (or
only use an interface in one direction and regular policies in the
other).
\* Interfaces may be created dynamically via updown/vici scripts, or
statically before or after establishing the SAs. Routes must be added
manually as needed (the daemon will not install any routes for
outbound policies with an interface ID).
\* When moving XFRM interfaces to other network namespaces they retain
access to the SAs and policies installed in the original namespace,
which allows providing IPsec tunnels for processes in other network
namespaces without giving them access to the IPsec keys or IKE
credentials. More information can be found on the page about
route-based VPNs.
\* Initiation of childless IKE\_SAs is supported (RFC 6023). If enabled
and supported by the responder, no CHILD\_SA is established during
IKE\_AUTH. Instead, all CHILD\_SAs are created with CREATE\_CHILD\_SA
exchanges. This allows using a separate DH exchange even for the first
CHILD\_SA, which is otherwise created during IKE\_AUTH with keys derived
from the IKE\_SA's key material.
\* The swanctl --initiate command may be used to initiate only the IKE\_SA
via --ike
option if --child is omitted and the peer supports this extension.
\* The NetworkManager backend and plugin support IPv6.
\* The new wolfssl plugin is a wrapper around the wolfSSL crypto library.
Thanks to Sean Parkinson of wolfSSL Inc. for the initial patch.
\* IKE SPIs may optionally be labeled via the charon.spi\_mask|label
options in strongswan.conf. This feature was extracted from
charon-tkm, however, now applies the mask/label in network order.
\* The openssl plugin supports ChaCha20-Poly1305 when built with OpenSSL
1.1.0.
\* The PB-TNC finite state machine according to section 3.2 of RFC 5793
was not correctly implemented when sending either a CRETRY or SRETRY
batch. These batches can only be sent in the "Decided" state and a
CRETRY batch can immediately carry all messages usually transported by
a CDATA batch. It is currently not possible to send a SRETRY batch
since full-duplex mode for PT-TLS transport is not supported.
\* Instead of marking IPv6 virtual IPs as deprecated, the kernel-netlink
plugin now uses address labels to avoid that such addresses are used
for non-VPN traffic (00a953d090).
\* The agent plugin now creates sockets to the ssh/gpg-agent dynamically
and does not keep them open, which otherwise might prevent the agent
from getting terminated.
\* To avoid broadcast loops the forecast plugin now only reinjects
packets that are marked
or received from the configured interface.
\* UTF-8 encoded passwords are supported via EAP-MSCHAPv2, which
internally uses an UTF-16LE encoding to calculate the NT hash (#3014).
\* Properly delete temporary drop policies (used when updating IP
addresses of SAs) if manual priorities are used, which was broken
since 5.6.2 (8e31d65730).
\* Avoid overwriting start\_action when parsing the inactivity timeout in
the vici plugin (#2954).
\* Fixed the automatic termination of reloaded vici connections with
start\_action=start, which was broken since 5.6.3 (71b22c250f).
\* The lookup for shared secrets for IKEv1 SAs via sql plugin should now
work better (6ec9f68f32).
\* Fixed a race condition in the trap manager between installation and
removal of a policy (69cbe2ca3f).
\* The IPsec stack detection and module loading in starter has been
removed (it wasn't enforced anyway and loading modules doesn't seem
necessary, also KLIPS hasn't been supported for a long time and PF\_KEY
will eventually be removed from the Linux kernel, ba817d2917).
\* Several IKEv2 protocol details are now handled more strictly:
Unrequested virtual IPs are ignored, CFG\_REPLY payloads are ignored if
no CFG\_REQUEST payloads were sent, a USE TRANSPORT\_MODE notify
received from the responder is checked against the local configuration.
\* The keys and certificates used by the scenarios in the testing
environment are now generated dynamically. Running the
testing/scripts/build-certs script after creating the base and root
images uses the pki utility installed in the latter to create the keys
and certificates for all the CAs and in some cases for individual
scenarios. These credentials are stored in the source tree, not the
image, so this has to be called only once even if the images are later
rebuilt. The script automatically (re-)rebuilds the guest images as
that generates fresh CRLs and signs the DNS zones. The only
keys/certificates currently not generated are the very large ones used
by the ikev2/rw-eap-tls-fragments scenario.
Version 5.7.2
\* For RSA with PSS padding, the TPM 2.0 specification mandates the
maximum salt length (as defined by the length of the key and hash).
However, if the TPM is FIPS-168-4 compliant, the salt length equals
the hash length. This is assumed for FIPS-140-2 compliant TPMs, but if
that's not the case, it might be necessary to manually enable
charon.plugins.tpm.fips\_186\_4 if the TPM doesn't use the maximum salt
length.
\* Directories for credentials loaded by swanctl are now accessed
relative to the loaded swanctl.conf file, in particular, when loading
it from a custom location via --file argument.
\* The base directory, which is used if no custom location for
swanctl.conf is specified, is now also configurable at runtime via
SWANCTL\_DIR environment variable.
\* If RADIUS Accounting is enabled, the eap-radius plugin will add the
session ID (Acct-Session-Id) to Access-Request messages, which e.g.
simplifies associating database entries for IP leases and accounting
with sessions (the session ID does not change when IKE\_SAs are
rekeyed, #2853).
\* All IP addresses assigned by a RADIUS server are included in
Accounting-Stop messages even if the client did not claim them,
allowing to release them early in case of connection errors (#2856).
\* Selectors installed on transport mode SAs by the kernel-netlink plugin
are now updated if an IP address changes (e.g. via MOBIKE) and it was
part of the selectors.
\* No deletes are sent anymore when a rekeyed CHILD\_SA expires (#2815).
\* The bypass-lan plugin now tracks interfaces to handle subnets that
move from one interface to another and properly update associated
routes (#2820).
\* Only valid and expected inbound IKEv2 messages are used to update the
timestamp of the last received message (previously, retransmits also
triggered an update).
\* IKEv2 requests from responders are now ignored until the IKE\_SA is
fully established (e.g. if a DPD request from the peer arrives before
the IKE\_AUTH response does, 46bea1add9). Delayed IKE\_SA\_INIT responses
with COOKIE notifies we already recevied are ignored, they caused
another reset of the IKE\_SA previously (#2837).
\* Active and queued Quick Mode tasks are now adopted if the peer
reauthenticates an IKEv1 SA while creating lots of CHILD\_SAs.
\* Newer versions of the FreeBSD kernel add an SADB\_X\_EXT\_SA2 extension
to SADB\_ACQUIRE messages, which allows the kernel-pfkey plugin to
determine the reqid of the policy even if it wasn't installed by the
daemon previously (e.g. when using FreeBSD's if\_ipsec(4) VTIs, which
install policies themselves, 872b9b3e8d).
\* Added support for RSA signatures with SHA-256 and SHA-512 to the agent
plugin. For older versions of ssh/gpg-agent that only support SHA-1,
IKEv2 signature authentication has to be disabled via
charon.signature\_authentication.
\* The sshkey and agent plugins support Ed25519/Ed448 SSH keys and
signatures.
\* The openssl plugin supports X25519/X448 Diffie-Hellman and
Ed25519/Ed448 keys and signatures when built against OpenSSL 1.1.1.
\* Support for Ed25519, ChaCha20/Poly1305, SHA-3 and AES-CCM were added
to the botan plugin.
\* The mysql plugin now properly handles database connections with
transactions under heavy load (#2779).
\* IP addresses in ha pools are now distributed evenly among all segments
(#2828).
\* Private key implementations may optionally provide a list of supported
signature schemes, which, as described above, is used by the tpm
plugin because for each key on a TPM 2.0 the hash algorithm and for
RSA also the padding scheme is predefined.
\* The testing environment is now based on Debian 9 (stretch) by default.
This required some changes, in particular, updating to FreeRADIUS 3.x
(which forced us to abandon the TNC@FHH patches and scenarios,
2fbe44bef3) and removing FIPS-enabled versions of OpenSSL (the FIPS
module only supports OpenSSL 1.0.2).
\* Most test scenarios were migrated to swanctl.
Version 5.7.1
\* Fixes a vulnerability in the gmp plugin triggered by crafted
certificates with RSA keys with very small moduli. When verifying
signatures with such keys, the code patched with the fix for
CVE-2018-16151/2 caused an integer underflow and subsequent heap
buffer overflow that results in a crash of the daemon.
\* The vulnerability has been registered as CVE-2018-17540.
Version 5.7.0
\* Fixes a potential authorization bypass vulnerability in the gmp plugin
that was caused by a too lenient verification of PKCS#1 v1.5
signatures. Several flaws could be exploited by a Bleichenbacher-style
attack to forge signatures for low-exponent keys (i.e. with e=3).
\* CVE-2018-16151 has been assigned to the problem of accepting random
bytes after the OID
of the hash function in such signatures, and CVE-2018-16152 has been
assigned to the issue
of not verifying that the parameters in the ASN.1 algorithmIdentitifer
structure is empty. Other flaws that don't lead to a vulnerability
directly (e.g. not checking for at least 8 bytes of padding) have no
separate CVE assigned.
\* Dots are not allowed anymore in section names in swanctl.conf and
strongswan.conf. This mainly affects the configuration of file
loggers. If the path for such a log file contains dots it now has to
be configured in the new path setting within the arbitrarily renamed
subsection in the filelog section.
\* Sections in swanctl.conf and strongswan.conf may now reference other
sections. All settings and subsections from such a section are
inherited. This allows to simplify configs as redundant information
has only to be specified once and may then be included in other
sections (see strongswan.conf for an example).
\* The originally selected IKE config (based on the IPs and IKE version)
can now change if no matching algorithm proposal is found. This way
the order of the configs doesn't matter that much anymore and it's
easily possible to specify separate configs for clients that require
weaker algorithms (instead of having to also add them in other configs
that might be selected).
\* Support for Postquantum Preshared Keys for IKEv2
(draft-ietf-ipsecme-qr-ikev2) has been added. For an example refer to
the swanctl/rw-cert-ppk scenario (or with EAP, or PSK authentication).
\* The new botan plugin is a wrapper around the Botan C++ crypto library.
It requires a fairly recent build from Botan's master branch (or the
upcoming 2.8.0 release). Thanks to René Korthaus and his team from
Rohde & Schwarz Cybersecurity for the initial patch and to Jack Lloyd
for quickly adding missing functions to Botan's FFI (C89) interface.
\* Implementation of RFC 8412 "Software Inventory Message and Attributes
(SWIMA) for PA-TNC".
\* SWIMA subscription option sets CLOSE\_WRITE trigger on apt history.log
file resulting in a ClientRetry PB-TNC batch to initialize a new
measurement cycle. The new imv/imc-swima plugins replace the previous
imv/imc-swid plugins, which were removed.
\* Added support for fuzzing the PA-TNC (RFC 5792) and PB-TNC (RFC 5793)
NEA protocols
on Google's OSS-Fuzz infrastructure.
\* Support for version 2 of Intel's TPM2-TSS TGC Software Stack. The
presence of the in-kernel /dev/tpmrm0 resource manager is
automatically detected.
\* The pki tool accepts a xmppAddr otherName as a subjectAlternativeName
using the syntax --san xmppaddr:<jid>.
\* swanctl.conf supports the configuration of marks the in- and/or
outbound SA should apply to packets after processing on Linux.
Configuring such a mark for outbound SAs requires at least a 4.14
kernel. The ability to set a mask and configuring a mark/mask for
inbound SAs will be added with the upcoming 4.19 kernel.
\* New options in swanctl.conf allow configuring how/whether DF, ECN and
DS fields in the IP headers are copied during IPsec processing.
Controlling this is currently only possible
on Linux.
\* The handling of sequence numbers in IKEv1 DPDs has been improved
(#2714).
\* To avoid conflicts, the dhcp plugin now only uses the DHCP server port
if explicitly configured.
Version 5.6.3
\* Fixed a DoS vulnerability in the IKEv2 key derivation if the openssl
plugin is used in FIPS mode and HMAC-MD5 is negotiated as PRF. This
vulnerability has been registered as CVE-2018-10811.
\* Fixed a vulnerability in the stroke plugin, which did not check the
received length before reading a message from the socket. Unless a
group is configured, root privileges are required to access that
socket, so in the default configuration this shouldn't be an issue.
This vulnerability has been registered as CVE-2018-5388.
\* CRLs that are not yet valid are now ignored to avoid problems in
scenarios where expired certificates are removed from new CRLs and the
clock on the host doing the revocation check is trailing behind that
of the host issuing CRLs. Not doing this could result in accepting a
revoked and expired certificate, if it's still valid according to the
trailing clock but not contained anymore in not yet valid CRLs.
\* The issuer of fetched CRLs is now compared to the issuer of the
checked certificate (#2608).
\* CRL validation results other than revocation (e.g. a skipped check
because the CRL couldn't be fetched) are now stored also for
intermediate CA certificates and not only for end-entity certificates,
so a strict CRL policy can be enforced in such cases.
\* In compliance with RFC 4945, section 5.1.3.2, certificates used for
IKE must now either not contain a keyUsage extension (like the ones
generated by pki), or have at least one of the digitalSignature or
nonRepudiation bits set.
\* New options for vici/swanctl allow forcing the local termination of an
IKE\_SA. This might be useful in situations where it's known the other
end is not reachable anymore, or that it already removed the IKE\_SA,
so retransmitting a DELETE and waiting for a response would be
pointless.
\* Waiting only a certain amount of time for a response (i.e. shorter
than all retransmits would be) before destroying the IKE\_SA is also
possible by additionally specifying a timeout in the forced
termination request.
\* When removing routes, the kernel-netlink plugin now checks if it
tracks other routes for the same destination and replaces the
installed route instead of just removing it. Same during installation,
where existing routes previously weren't replaced. This should allow
using traps with virtual IPs on Linux (#2162).
\* The dhcp plugin now only sends the client identifier DHCP option if
the identity\_lease setting is enabled (7b660944b6). It can also send
identities of up to 255 bytes length, instead of the previous 64 bytes
(30e886fe3b, 0e5b94d038). If a server address is configured, DHCP
requests are now sent from port 67 instead of 68 to avoid ICMP port
unreachables (becf027cd9).
\* The handling of faulty INVALID\_KE\_PAYLOAD notifies (e.g. one
containing a DH group that wasn't proposed) during CREATE\_CHILD\_SA
exchanges has been improved (#2536).
\* Roam events are now completely ignored for IKEv1 SAs (there is no
MOBIKE to handle such changes properly).
\* ChaCha20/Poly1305 is now correctly proposed without key length
(#2614). For compatibility with
older releases the chacha20poly1305compat keyword may be included in
proposals to also propose the algorithm with a key length
(c58434aeff).
\* Configuration of hardware offload of IPsec SAs is now more flexible
and allows a new setting (auto), which automatically uses it if the
kernel and device both support it. If hw
offload is set to yes and offloading is not supported, the CHILD\_SA
installation now fails.
\* The kernel-pfkey plugin optionally installs routes via internal
interface (one with an IP in the local traffic selector). On FreeBSD,
enabling this selects the correct source IP when sending packets from
the gateway itself (e811659323).
\* SHA-2 based PRFs are supported in PKCS#8 files as generated by OpenSSL
1.1 (#2574).
\* The pki --verify tool may load CA certificates and CRLs from
directories.
\* The IKE daemon now also switches to port 4500 if the remote port is
not 500 (e.g. because the remote maps the response to a different
port, as might happen on Azure), as long as the local port is 500
(85bfab621d).
\* Fixed an issue with DNS servers passed to NetworkManager in charon-nm
(ee8c25516a).
\* Logged traffic selectors now always contain the protocol if either
protocol or port are set (a36d8097ed).
\* Only the inbound SA/policy will be updated as reaction to IP address
changes for rekeyed CHILD\_SAs that are kept around.
\* The parser for strongswan.conf/swanctl.conf now accepts = characters
in values without having to put the value in quotes (e.g. for Base64
encoded shared secrets).
Notes for developers:
\* trap\_manager\_t: Trap policies are now unistalled by peer/child name
and not the reqid.
\* No reqid is returned anymore when installing trap policies.
\* child\_sa\_t: A new state (CHILD\_DELETED) is used for CHILD\_SAs that
have been deleted but not yet destroyed (after a rekeying CHILD\_SAs
are kept around for a while to process delayed packets). This way
child\_updown events are not triggered anymore for such SAs when an
IKE\_SA that has such CHILD\_SAs assigned is deleted.
Version 5.6.2
\* Fixed a DoS vulnerability in the parser for PKCS#1 RSASSA-PSS
signatures that was caused by insufficient input validation. One of
the configurable parameters in algorithm identifier structures for
RSASSA-PSS signatures is the mask generation function (MGF). Only MGF1
is currently specified for this purpose. However, this in turn takes
itself a parameter that specifies the underlying hash function.
strongSwan's parser did not correctly handle the case of this
parameter being absent, causing an undefined data read. This
vulnerability has been registered as CVE-2018-6459.
\* When rekeying IKEv2 IKE\_SAs the previously negotiated DH group will be
reused, instead of using the first configured group, which avoids an
additional exchange if the peer previously selected a different DH
group via INVALID\_KE\_PAYLOAD notify. The same is also done when
rekeying CHILD\_SAs except for the first rekeying of the CHILD\_SA that
was created with the IKE\_SA, where no DH group was negotiated yet.
Also, the selected DH group is moved to the front in all sent
proposals that contain it and all proposals that don't are moved to
the back in order to convey the preference for this group to the peer.
\* Handling of MOBIKE task queuing has been improved. In particular, the
response to an address update (with NAT-D payloads) is not ignored
anymore if only an address list update
or DPD is queued as that could prevent updating the UDP encapsulation
in the kernel.
\* On Linux, roam events may optionally be triggered by changes to the
routing rules, which can be useful if routing rules (instead of e.g.
route metrics) are used to switch from one to another interface (i.e.
from one to another routing table). Since routing rules are currently
not evaluated when doing route lookups this is only useful if the
kernel-based route lookup is used (4664992f7d).
\* The fallback drop policies installed to avoid traffic leaks when
replacing addresses in installed policies are now replaced by
temporary drop policies, which also prevent acquires because we
currently delete and reinstall IPsec SAs to update their addresses
(35ef1b032d).
\* Access X.509 certificates held in non-volatile storage of a TPM 2.0
referenced via the NV index. Adding the --keyid parameter to pki
--print allows to print private keys or certificates stored in a
smartcard or a TPM 2.0.
\* Fixed proposal selection if a peer incorrectly sends DH groups in the
ESP proposal during IKE\_AUTH and also if a DH group is configured in
the local ESP proposal and charon.prefer configured\_proposals is
disabled (d058fd3c32).
\* The lookup for PSK secrets for IKEv1 has been improved for certain
scenarios (see #2497 for details).
\* MSKs received via RADIUS are now padded to 64 bytes to avoid
compatibility issues with EAP-MSCHAPv2 and PRFs that have a block size
< 64 bytes (e.g. AES-XCBC-PRF-128, see 73cbce6013).
\* The tpm\_extendpcr command line tool extends a digest into a TPM PCR.
\* Ported the NetworkManager backend from the deprecated libnm-glib to
libnm.
\* The save-keys debugging/development plugin saves IKE and/or ESP keys
to files compatible with Wireshark.
Version 5.6.1
\* Several algorithms were removed from the default ESP/AH and IKE
proposals in compliance with RFC 8221 and RFC 8247, respectively.
Removed from the default ESP/AH proposal were the 3DES and Blowfish
encryption algorithms and the HMAC-MD5 integrity algorithm. From the
IKE default proposal the HMAC-MD5 integrity algorithm and the
MODP-1024 Diffie-Hellman group were removed (the latter is significant
for Windows clients in their default configuration). These algorithms
may still be used in custom proposals.
\* Support for RSASSA-PSS signatures has been added. For compatibility
with previous releases they are currently not used automatically, by
default, to change that charon.rsa\_pss may be enabled. To explicitly
use or require such signatures during IKEv2 signature authentication
(RFC 7427) ike:rsa/pss... authentication constraints may be used for
specific connections (regardless of whether the strongswan.conf option
above is enabled). Only the hash algorithm can be specified in such
constraints, the MGF1 will be based on that hash and the salt length
will equal the hash length (when verifying the salt length is not
enforced). To enforce such signatures during PKI verification use
rsa/pss... authentication constraints.
\* All pki commands that create certificates/CRLs can be made to sign
with RSASSA-PSS instead
of the classing PKCS#1 scheme with the --rsa-padding pss option. As
with signatures during authentication, only the hash algorithm is
configurable (via --digest option), the MGF1 will be based on that
and the salt length will equal the hash length.
\* These signatures are supported by all RSA backends except pkcs11 (i.e.
gmp, gcrypt, openssl). The gmp plugin requires the mgf1 plugin. Note
that RSASSA-PSS algorithm identifiers and parameters in keys (public
keys in certificates or private keys in PKCS#8 files) are currently
not used as constraints.
\* The sec-updater tool checks for security updates in dpkg-based
repositories (e.g. Debian/Ubuntu) and sets the security flags in the
IMV policy database accordingly. Additionally for each new package
version a SWID tag for the given OS and HW architecture is created and
stored in the database.
\* Using the sec-updater.sh script template the lookup can be automated
(e.g. via an hourly cron job).
\* When restarting an IKEv2 negotiation after receiving an
INVALID\_KE\_PAYLOAD notify (or due to other reasons like too many
retransmits) a new initiator SPI is allocated. This prevents issues
caused by retransmits for IKE\_SA\_INIT messages.
\* Because the initiator SPI was previously reused when restarting the
connection delayed responses for previous connection attempts were
processed and might have caused fatal errors due to a failed DH
negotiation or because of the internal retry counter in the ike-init
task. For instance, if we proposed a DH group the responder rejected
we might have later received delayed responses that either contained
INVALID\_KE\_PAYLOAD notifies with the DH group we already switched to,
or, if we retransmitted an IKE\_SA\_INIT with the requested group but
then had to restart again, a KE payload with a group different from
the one we proposed.
\* The introduction of file versions in the IMV database scheme broke
file reference hash measurements. This has been fixed by creating
generic product versions having an empty package name.
\* A new timeout option for the systime-fix plugin stops periodic system
time checks after a while and enforces a certificate verification,
closing or reauthenticating all SAs with invalid certificates.
\* The IKE event counters, previously only available via ipsec
listcounters command, may now also be queried and reset via vici and
the new swanctl --counters command. They are collected and provided by
the optional counters plugin (enabled by default for backwards
compatibility if the stroke plugin is built).
\* Class attributes received in RADIUS Access-Accept messages may
optionally be added to RADIUS accounting messages (655924074b).
\* Basic support for systemd sockets has been added, which may be used
for privilege separation (59db98fb94).
\* Inbound marks may optionally be installed in the SA again (was removed
with 5.5.2) by enabling the mark\_in\_sa option in swanctl.conf.
\* The timeout of leases in pools configured via pool utility may be
configured in other units than hours. INITIAL\_CONTACT notifies are now
only omitted if never is configured as uniqueness policy.
\* Outbound FWD policies for shunts are not installed anymore, by default
(as is the case for other policies since 5.5.1).
\* Don't consider a DH group mismatch during CHILD\_SA rekeying as failure
as responder (e7276f78aa).
\* Handling of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets in libipsec has been
improved (e138003de9).
\* Trigger expire events for the correct IPsec SA in libipsec
(6e861947a0).
\* A crash in CRL verification via openssl plugin using OpenSSL 1.1 has
been fixed (78acaba6a1).
\* No hard-coded default proposals are passed from starter to the stroke
plugin anymore (the IKE proposal used curve25519 since 5.5.2, which is
an optional plugin).
\* A workaround for an issue with virtual IPs on macOS 10.13 (High
Sierra) has been added (039b85dd43).
\* Handling of IKE\_SA rekey collisions in charon-tkm has been fixed.
\* Instead of failing or just silently doing nothing unit tests may now
warn about certain conditions (e.g. if a test was not executed due to
external dependencies).

[https://www.strongswan.org/blog/2018/02/19/strongswan-vulnerability-(cve-2018-6459).html](https://www.strongswan.org/blog/2018/02/19/strongswan-vulnerability-%28cve-2018-6459%29.html)  Our fuzzer on Google's OSS-Fuzz infrastructure revealed a bug in the parser for PKCS#1 RSASSA-PSS signature parameters introduced with 5.6.1 that may lead to a denial-of-service attack. Insufficient Input Validation in RSASSA-PSS Signature Parser  Incorrectly encoded or crafted RSASSA-PSS signature values may cause a crash while parsing. Potential triggers are signatures in certificates, but also signatures used for IKEv2 signature authentication (RFC 7427). Affected is strongSwan 5.6.1.  CVE-2018-6459 has been assigned for this vulnerability.  ASN.1 encoded algorithm identifier structures for RSASSA-PSS signatures (RFC 8017) contain parameters that specify details, like hash algorithms and the salt length, used to create/verify the signatures. One of the configurable parameters is the mask generation function (MGF). Currently, only MGF1 is specified for this purpose. However, this in turn takes itself a parameter that specifies the underlying hash function. strongSwan's parser did not correctly handle the case of this parameter being absent, causing an undefined data read that results in a potential denial-of-service vulnerability.  Whether it actually causes a crash depends on the data on the stack at the time of parsing the MGF1 algorithm identifier.  Remote code execution is not possible due to this issue.

I don't see this and it breaks all (!!!) configuration. We have to migrate vom ipsec.conf to swanctl.conf now! Imo, it cannot be the correct way for a moderate security update. ``` |  |
