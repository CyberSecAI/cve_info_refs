Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-6408:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The root cause is the lack of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in the web interface of Conceptronic IP cameras. Specifically, sensitive requests to `user.cgi` do not have CSRF tokens or any other kind of protection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to CSRF attacks. This allows an attacker to make unauthorized requests on behalf of an authenticated user. The following specific requests are vulnerable:
    *   `/hy-cgi/user.cgi?cmd=edituser&at_username=admin&at_newpassword=new_password&at_newrolename=admin&at_userid=10001`: Allows changing the admin user's password without knowing the old password.
    *   `/hy-cgi/user.cgi?cmd=adduser&at_username=admin2&at_password=admin2&at_rolename=admin`: Allows creation of a new admin user.
    *  `/hy-cgi/user.cgi?cmd=checkuserinfo`: In special circumstances, allows an attacker to view the victim's current password in plaintext

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Account Takeover:** An attacker can change the administrator's password, effectively taking control of the camera.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Gaining credentials allows an attacker to access the camera's video and audio streams.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can create a new administrator user, gaining full control.
*  **Information Disclosure:** Under certain circumstances, an attacker could obtain the password of an existing user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Web Pages:** The attacker tricks the victim into visiting a malicious web page. This page contains code that forces the victim's browser to send unauthorized requests to the vulnerable IP camera. The victim must already be authenticated to the camera's web interface for the attack to succeed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to reach the camera's web interface. This usually means being on the same local network as the camera or having access to the camera through a forwarded port over the internet.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick a user that is already logged into the web interface into visiting a malicious web page in order to successfully exploit the CSRF vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
* The provided CVSS score is 7.2, with a vector of  AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N/E:F/RL:U/RC:C, which is slightly different than the information on the official CVE.
*   The exploit code (not included here, but referenced) is available in the repository for testing purposes.
*   The vulnerability exists on Conceptronic IP Cameras with 0.61.X. web firmware.
*   The `checkuserinfo` endpoint might disclose the password in plaintext.
