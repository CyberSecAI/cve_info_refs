This GitHub page displays the contents of a directory named `KVFG_220400` within the `Jiangmin_Antivirus_POC` repository. The directory contains files such as `CVEPOC.exe`, `bsod.png`, and `poc.txt`.  The presence of `CVEPOC.exe` and `poc.txt` suggests this repository contains proof-of-concept code related to a CVE. However, the specific CVE is not mentioned, and the content of the files is not accessible from this page. There is no additional information about the vulnerability itself.

Given the available information, I can not confirm if this content relates to CVE-2018-6777.
