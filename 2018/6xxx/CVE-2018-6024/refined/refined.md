Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6024:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw present in the "search" functionality of the Joomla! Component Project Log version 1.5.3.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `search` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Access:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to read, modify, or delete sensitive data stored in the database.
- **Data Breach:**  Confidential information could be leaked or stolen.
- **Application Compromise:** Attackers could potentially take control of the Joomla! application and underlying server depending on database permissions

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:**  The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable application component.
- **`search` Parameter:** The `search` parameter in the URL is the entry point for the malicious SQL injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target Joomla! application.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** Knowledge of HTTP requests and URL parameters is required.
- **SQL Knowledge:** The attacker must have knowledge of SQL to craft malicious queries.
- **No Authentication Required:** The provided information does not indicate any authentication requirements for exploiting this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
The exploit-db entry provides a proof of concept (POC) that demonstrates how to inject malicious SQL code. The vulnerable URL structure is:
`http://localhost/[PATH]/index.php?option=com_projectlog&view=cat&search=[SQL]`
The provided example payload is URL-encoded and meant to demonstrate the SQL Injection vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerable component is "Project Log" version 1.5.3.
- The component is available through the Joomla! extensions directory.
- The component has been unpublished due to "broken links".
