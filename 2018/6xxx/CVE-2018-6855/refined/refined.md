Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-6855:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `lcencvm.sys` kernel driver of Sophos SafeGuard products.
- Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted input buffer to the driver through the IO Control Code `0x80202014`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Uncontrolled Write:** The crafted input buffer manipulates the execution flow of the driver, causing the constant `0xFFFFFFFF` to be written to an address controlled by the user in kernel space. This uncontrolled write allows modification of arbitrary kernel memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local Privilege Escalation:** By leveraging the arbitrary memory write, an attacker can modify the `SEP_TOKEN_PRIVILEGES` structure of their own process's token.
- **SYSTEM Level Code Execution:** Specifically, an attacker can grant themselves the `SE_DEBUG_NAME` privilege. With this privilege, the attacker can interact with higher-privileged processes (including those running as SYSTEM), enabling the execution of arbitrary code in the security context of the SYSTEM user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
- **IOCTL Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a specially crafted input buffer to the vulnerable driver through its IOCTL interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to interact with the `lcencvm.sys` driver which requires the ability to open a handle to the driver and issue IOCTLs.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft and send the input buffer that causes the uncontrolled write.
- The attacker needs to know the structure of the kernel objects that they are manipulating, like `SEP_TOKEN_PRIVILEGES`.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `lcencvm.sys` driver.
- The affected products and versions are listed in the content.
- The content also includes a description of how the attack can grant `SE_DEBUG_NAME` privilege by modifying `SEP_TOKEN_PRIVILEGES` structure in the process token.
- It's also mentioned that this method can be used to execute code in the context of SYSTEM user.
- The blog post references the vulnerability being one of a series of vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-6851 to CVE-2018-6857) found in the same Sophos product line.
