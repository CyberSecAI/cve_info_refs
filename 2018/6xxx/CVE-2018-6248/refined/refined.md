- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer handler for `DxgkDdiEscape`. The software uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer but uses an incorrect length value.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read/write due to incorrect length value when accessing a buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service or potential escalation of privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is located in the kernel mode layer, and an attacker would need to leverage the `DxgkDdiEscape` handler.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Local access with low privileges is required, and no user interaction is needed.
