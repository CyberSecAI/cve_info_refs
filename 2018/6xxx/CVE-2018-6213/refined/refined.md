{
  "CVE-2018-6213": {
    "Description": "A backdoor account exists in the firmware of D-Link DIR-620 routers, that can be exploited by attackers to access the deviceâ€™s web panel and take over devices exposed online.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The firmware has hardcoded default credentials for a backdoor account, which allows unauthenticated attackers to gain privileged access to the firmware and extract sensitive data.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Hardcoded credentials",
      "Lack of proper access control",
      "Vulnerable web interface allows arbitrary JavaScript execution"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can gain full control of the router, including access to the web panel, ability to execute commands on the OS, and data exfiltration, potentially leading to further network compromise.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Unauthenticated access to the web panel via the internet."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Unauthenticated remote attacker able to reach the router's admin panel over the network."
