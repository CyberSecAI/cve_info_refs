{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `hidRuleId` parameter in `editPolicy.jsp` is not sanitized before being used in a DELETE SQL query.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection [CWE-89]"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands, leading to potential data loss or manipulation. In the provided example, the attacker is able to truncate the `RulesEmailIndex`, `SubRuleIndex`, and `RulesEngine` tables.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious HTTP POST request to the `/editPolicy.jsp` endpoint with a crafted `hidRuleId` parameter.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint and needs to be authenticated within the web console to access the vulnerable page. However, the provided exploit chains this vulnerability with others, in order to obtain remote code execution as an unauthenticated attacker."
