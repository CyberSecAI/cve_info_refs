Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-6147:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a flaw in the "Views" component of the Chromium browser. Specifically, password fields within this component were not taking advantage of operating system (OS) protections. This means that the way the password fields were handled didn't leverage the security mechanisms provided by the underlying OS to safeguard password inputs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of OS Protection:** The primary vulnerability is the failure of password fields to use OS-level protections. This implies a weakness in how Chromium implemented password input handling within the "Views" component.
*   This lack of OS-level protection leaves the password entry field vulnerable to potential exploits that the OS is designed to prevent.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The specific impact is not detailed in the provided information, but generally, not using OS protections for password fields could lead to exposure of sensitive password data through methods such as keylogging or other input monitoring techniques that the OS might otherwise prevent or mitigate.
*   This could potentially lead to unauthorized access to user accounts and associated data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the user interacting with a password field within the Chromium browser that does not implement the appropriate OS security protections.
*   This could be any password input field within a website or application rendered in the Chromium browser's views component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker would need the ability to monitor or intercept input events intended for password fields within the Chromium browser. This could be achieved through various malicious methods including malware on a user's system or through browser extensions with malicious intent.
* The attacker would likely need local access to the targeted system or a method of injecting malicious code into the browser environment.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Michail Pishchagin from Yandex.
*   The issue was fixed in Chromium version 67.0.3396.62.
*   The bug report for this issue is tracked under [https://crbug.com/818133](https://crbug.com/818133).
*   Red Hat assigned this vulnerability a severity of "Important".
*   The fix was included in Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2018:1815.
*   The Debian Security Advisory for this issue is DSA-4237-1

In summary, CVE-2018-6147 is due to the chromium browser failing to utilise OS protections for password fields, potentially allowing malicious software to intercept sensitive password information.
