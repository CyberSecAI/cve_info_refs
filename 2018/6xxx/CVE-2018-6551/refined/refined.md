{
  "CVE-2018-6551": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow in `_int_malloc` function due to increased `MALLOC_ALIGNMENT` on certain architectures (ppc and i386).",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Integer overflow in `_int_malloc` leading to incorrect memory allocation sizes. This affects `malloc` and aligned memory allocation functions that use `_int_malloc` internally.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Incorrect memory allocation, potentially leading to heap corruption or other memory-related issues. Specifically, posix_memalign may incorrectly return success when a very large allocation is requested.",
     "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through calls to memory allocation functions, specifically `malloc`, `posix_memalign` and other functions that rely on `_int_malloc`.  A large size is requested during allocation, causing an integer overflow.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs the ability to control the size argument passed to memory allocation functions. Local user access is sufficient to trigger the vulnerability."
