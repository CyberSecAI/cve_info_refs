Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6558:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from incorrect privilege handling within the `pam_fscrypt` module of the `fscrypt` software. Specifically, the module attempts to drop privileges to perform actions on behalf of a user and then restore those privileges. However, the restoration process was flawed, causing the module to incorrectly restore the primary and supplementary group IDs to those of the root user (gid 0) instead of the original user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect privilege restoration:** The core issue is that `pam_fscrypt`'s privilege dropping and restoration logic incorrectly set the effective group ID (egid) and supplementary groups of a process to those of the root user upon exiting the PAM module.
- **Lack of reversibility:** The initial implementation of privilege changes, especially concerning keyring linking, did not ensure that the changes could be reversed reliably, leading to errors in scenarios like `su <user>` usage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** An unprivileged user can gain membership in the root group (gid 0). This allows the user to perform actions that should be restricted to root, such as modifying or deleting files owned by the root group if they have write permissions.
- **System Error:**  The incorrect privilege handling could cause a system error when an unprivileged user tries to switch to another user using `su`, preventing the user from switching accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Successful Login:** The vulnerability is triggered during successful logins through applications that use Linux-PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules).
- **`su` Command:** The `su` command, when used by an unprivileged user to switch to another user, exposes the vulnerability if `pam_fscrypt` is enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system where the `fscrypt` package with the vulnerable `pam_fscrypt` module is installed.
- **Ability to Login:** The attacker needs to be able to log into the system or switch users using the `su` command.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was discovered in August 2018 by a user named Mark and was quickly addressed by the fscrypt maintainers.
- The fix involves ensuring that the original euid, egid, and supplementary groups of the process are properly saved and restored.
- Patches were developed and released to fix the issue and also to ensure privilege changes related to user keyrings are reversible.
- The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2018-6558 and is tracked under the GitHub Advisory ID GHSA-qj26-7grj-whg3.
- The vulnerable versions of fscrypt are prior to 0.2.4. Version 0.2.4 and later contain the fix.
- The vulnerability is categorized as "Moderate" severity with a CVSS score of 6.5
- The vulnerability has a low attack complexity, low privileges required, and no user interaction is needed for exploitation. The impact is a high potential for integrity compromise.
