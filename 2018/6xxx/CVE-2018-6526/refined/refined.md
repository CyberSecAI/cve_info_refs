Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6526:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an incorrect initialization of the `$t_filter` variable in the `current_user_get_bug_filter()` function within `/core/current_user_api.php`.
*   The variable was initially set as a string (`''`) instead of an array (`array()`).
*   When a `filter` parameter was passed in the URL, the function `filter_ensure_valid_filter()` expected an array as input and would throw an error when receiving a string. This is because it expects an array to be passed into the function, but a string is given, causing an error.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Disclosure:** The error message revealed the full server path to the affected file (`/srv/www/bugs/core/current_user_api.php`). This information can be leveraged by attackers to gain knowledge about the system's file structure, aiding in further attacks.
*   **Type Error:** A type error occurs when a string is passed to a function that expects an array, leading to an application error.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** The primary impact is the disclosure of the server's internal file path. While not directly allowing for remote code execution, it exposes sensitive information to potential attackers.
*   **Denial of Service (Potential):** While not explicitly stated, the error condition could potentially contribute to a denial of service if exploited repeatedly.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/bugs/view_all_bug_page.php` endpoint.
*   The malicious request includes a `filter` parameter with a non-array value, such as an integer (e.g., `?filter=1`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Special Privileges:** No authentication or special privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to send HTTP requests to the affected MantisBT instance.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes a fix where the `$t_filter` variable is correctly initialized as an empty array (`$t_filter = array();`).
*   The issue was present in the master branch after a change to the error handler during the introduction of exceptions. It was not present in version 2.10.0
*   The vulnerability was fixed before a release, so it was not present in a released version, however CVE was still generated for the vulnerability. The CVE incorrectly states the vulnerability affects version 2.10.0 and below.

In summary, CVE-2018-6526 is a path disclosure vulnerability caused by an incorrect variable type initialization that exposes the serverâ€™s file structure. This is a low-complexity issue that can be exploited by sending an HTTP GET request with a specific query parameter, and can be used to aid further attacks.
