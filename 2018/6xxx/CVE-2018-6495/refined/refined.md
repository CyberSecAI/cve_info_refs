Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

* **Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization or encoding within the Micro Focus Universal CMDB/CMS and Micro Focus UCMDB Browser. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.
* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The specific weakness is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
* **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    * Session hijacking
    * Cookie theft
    * Defacement of the user interface
    * Redirecting users to malicious websites
    * Performing actions on behalf of the user
* **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is remote, meaning an attacker can exploit this vulnerability over a network. The specific method of injection (e.g., via a crafted URL parameter, form input, or other user-supplied data) is not specified in this document.
* **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script into the application, which can be done remotely. No specific user privileges on the server are needed.
