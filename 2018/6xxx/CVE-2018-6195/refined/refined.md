Based on the provided information, the content relates to CVE-2018-6195. Specifically, it details a PHP Object Injection vulnerability in the WordPress Splashing Images Plugin before version 2.1.1.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability:** PHP Object Injection
*   **Affected Component:** `admin/partials/wp-splashing-admin-main.php` in the wp-splashing-images plugin
*   **Root Cause:** The application unserializes data from the `session` HTTP GET parameter after base64 decoding it.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Crafted serialized data in the 'session' HTTP GET parameter to `wp-admin/upload.php`.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Authenticated attacker with administrator, editor, or author role.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary file deletion to arbitrary code execution depending on available classes and actions performed in magic methods (`__wakeup()` or `__destruct()`).
*   **Technical Details:** The code `$data = unserialize(base64_decode($_GET['session']));` in `wp-splashing-images/admin/partials/wp-splashing-admin-main.php` is vulnerable.
*   **Proof of Concept:** A sample payload is provided: `http://<host>/wp-admin/upload.php?page=wp-splashing&session=TzoyMDoiUEhQX09iamVjdF9JbmplY3Rpb24iOjA6e30%3D`
*   **Fix:** Update to version 2.1.1.  The fix involved using `unserialize(base64_decode($_GET['session']), ['allowed_classes' => false]);`
