Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6347:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in how Proxygen handles HTTP/2 header and trailer parsing. Specifically, the logic for tracking the last processed stream ID (`lastStreamID_`) was flawed. It could be lowered in certain situations, which could lead to incorrect processing of headers and trailers. This incorrect processing could be exploited to trigger a denial-of-service condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Stream ID Tracking:** The core issue is the flawed logic for updating `lastStreamID_`, where it could be lowered incorrectly, leading to misinterpretation of subsequent header and trailer frames.
*   **Denial of Service:**  The vulnerability manifests as a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. An attacker can send specially crafted HTTP/2 requests, exploiting this parsing flaw to cause the server to malfunction or crash.
*   **Improper Input Handling**: Specifically with how HTTP2 headers and trailers are parsed which can be triggered by sending malformed requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a denial-of-service, making the affected server or service unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending malicious HTTP/2 requests over the network to a vulnerable server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable server.
*   **HTTP/2 knowledge**: The attacker needs to have the ability to craft malicious HTTP/2 requests.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No specific privileges or authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided commit `223e0aa6bc7590e86af1e917185a2e0efe160711` addresses this issue by ensuring `lastStreamID_` is not lowered improperly.
*   The fix ensures that `lastStreamID_` is only updated if the new stream ID is greater and session is not closed.
*   The vulnerability is classified as high severity with a CVSS score of 7.5.
*   The affected Proxygen versions are prior to `v2018.12.31.00`.
*   The vulnerability is related to CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation)

**In summary,** CVE-2018-6347 is a high severity vulnerability in Proxygen's HTTP/2 parsing logic that can be exploited to cause a denial-of-service. The root cause is incorrect stream ID tracking.
