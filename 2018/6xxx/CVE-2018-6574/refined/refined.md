{
  "CVE-2018-6574": {
    "description": "Go before 1.8.7, Go 1.9.x before 1.9.4, and Go 1.10 pre-releases before Go 1.10rc2 allow \"go get\" remote command execution during source code build, by leveraging the gcc or clang plugin feature, because -fplugin= and -plugin= arguments were not blocked.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how the `go get` command handles compiler flags, specifically `-fplugin=` and `-plugin=`, which allows for loading of malicious plugins during the build process.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation of compiler flags",
        "Arbitrary code execution via C compiler plugins"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary command execution on the client side during the `go get` process.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "A remote attacker hosting malicious repositories.",
         "Typosquatting or other means of tricking a user into using a malicious repository"
      ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": [
        "Ability to host a malicious Go package repository containing a malicious plugin",
          "Ability to convince the victim to run `go get` with the malicious repository"
      ]
    },
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is triggered during the build step of `go get` due to the ability to insert malicious compiler flags through #cgo directives in Go source files. The fix implemented in Go 1.8.7, 1.9.4, and 1.10rc2 includes a whitelist of allowed compiler flags and restrictions of cgo directives outside of specific use cases."
