```
{
  "CVE-2018-6559": {
    "Root cause": "The overlayfs implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly verify directory contents permissions from within an unprivileged user namespace.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper permission verification in overlayfs",
        "Information Disclosure"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (protected file names).",
    "Attack vectors": "A local attacker must create user and mount namespaces, and then mount an overlayfs inside of the namespace, where the lower directory is the root and the upper directory is attacker controlled. They then create a directory in the upper layer with the same name as the directory in the root they wish to see the contents of (for example, a directory named 'root' to see the contents of /root).",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user with the ability to create user and mount namespaces and mount an overlayfs."
  }
