Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-6180:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper session cookie validation within the Online Voting System's profile section. The application updates user passwords based on an incremental identifier without requiring the current valid password, which allows an attacker to set an arbitrary password for any registered account.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Authentication Bypass:** Unauthenticated users can modify the password of other users.
    *   **Insufficient Session Validation:** The application does not verify the validity of the session cookie.
    *   **Insecure Password Update Mechanism:** The password update process relies on an easily guessable incremental identifier and lacks proper authorization.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to any user account by setting a new password. This can lead to full compromise of the user accounts, data breaches, and other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `admin/profile.php` endpoint.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. The attacker does not need to be authenticated with the application prior to exploiting the vulnerability. The attacker needs to know or guess the target user's ID (an incremental identifier in the reported system).

The provided exploit script demonstrates how to:
1.  Craft a POST request to `admin/profile.php` with the target user's ID and a new password.
2.  Login to the targeted account using the modified password.
