  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a misaligned memory access when handling disk64_trailer local entries in the __zzip_fetch_disk_trailer function of src/zzip/zip.c. The struct zzip_disk_trailer \"orig\" can be manipulated by a crafted zip file, leading to a misaligned memory access and a bus error.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Misaligned memory access"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by triggering a bus error, which could crash the application.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted ZIP file"
    ],
     "required_capabilities": [
      "The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted ZIP file to be opened by an application using the zziplib library."
