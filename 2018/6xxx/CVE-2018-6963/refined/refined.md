Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6963:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from multiple NULL pointer dereference issues within the RPC (Remote Procedure Call) handler of VMware Workstation and Fusion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The core issue is that the code attempts to dereference a NULL pointer, leading to a crash. This indicates a lack of proper input validation or error handling within the RPC handler.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service condition for the guest machine. This means the virtual machine becomes unresponsive or crashes, disrupting its functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **RPC Handler:** The vulnerability is triggered through the RPC handler, suggesting that an attacker needs to interact with this interface, most likely via a specially crafted request or command.
*   **Guest Machine:** The attacker needs to be in a position to interact with the guest machine.
*   **Limited Privileges:** The attacker is described as having "limited privileges on the guest machine," meaning they do not need administrative or root access to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to the Guest Machine:** The attacker needs to have some form of access to the guest operating system running inside the virtual machine.
*   **Ability to interact with RPC handler:** The attacker must be able to send some kind of RPC call or request that triggers the vulnerability.
*   **Limited privileges are sufficient**: The attacker doesn't need administrative or root privileges on the guest.

**Summary of CVE-2018-6963:**

CVE-2018-6963 describes a vulnerability in VMware Workstation and Fusion caused by NULL pointer dereference issues in their RPC handlers. An attacker with limited privileges on the guest machine can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service condition for the guest virtual machine by interacting with its RPC interface.
