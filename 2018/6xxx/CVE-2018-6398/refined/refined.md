Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6398:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `id` parameter of the `com_cpeventcalendar` component in Joomla.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input (`id` parameter) before using it in a SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Data Breach: An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials, personal data, and other confidential information.
- Data Modification: An attacker could also modify or delete data within the database, potentially causing significant damage to the application's functionality.
- Arbitrary Code Execution (potentially): In some SQL injection scenarios, it is possible to achieve remote code execution on the underlying server, although the provided exploit doesn't directly demonstrate this.
- Privilege Escalation: If the database user has higher privileges, exploitation can result in privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET Request: The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable Joomla component, specifically the `com_cpeventcalendar` component, with a malicious payload in the `id` parameter.
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target Joomla installation, which means the vulnerability is reachable from the network

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network connectivity to the target Joomla installation.
- Ability to send HTTP requests.
- Knowledge of the vulnerable component and the vulnerable parameter (`id`).
- Basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.
- No authentication is explicitly mentioned as being required, suggesting the vulnerability is accessible to unauthenticated users.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerable component is `CP Event Calendar` version 3.0.1
- The exploit information on Exploit-DB provides different SQL injection payloads for demonstration:
    - Boolean-based blind SQL injection
    - Error-based SQL injection
    - Time-based blind SQL injection
    - UNION query-based SQL injection
- The provided exploit shows how an attacker can use the SQL injection vulnerability to extract information such as database user, database name, and database version.
