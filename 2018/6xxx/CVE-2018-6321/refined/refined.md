Root cause of vulnerability: The "panda_url_filtering" service in Panda Global Security 17.0.1 uses an unquoted service path in its binary path name.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Unquoted service path vulnerability. The service's binary path "C:\Program Files\Panda Security URL Filtering\Panda_URL_Filteringb.exe" is not enclosed in quotes.
Impact of exploitation: An authorized but non-privileged local user can execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges. A malicious executable placed in a directory within the service path (e.g., C:\Program.exe) will be executed when the service starts.
Attack vectors: A local attacker can place a malicious executable in a higher-priority location within the unquoted service path and cause it to be executed by the service, which runs with LocalSystem privileges.
Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to have local access and the ability to write files to the system.
