{
  "CVE-2018-6914": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Dir.mktmpdir method in the tmpdir library in Ruby does not properly sanitize the prefix argument, allowing directory traversal through '../' sequences.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Directory traversal"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can create arbitrary directories or files outside the intended temporary directory, potentially leading to file overwrite or arbitrary code execution if the created directory or file is used in an unsafe manner.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by passing a malicious prefix containing '../' sequences to the Dir.mktmpdir method.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to control the prefix argument of the Dir.mktmpdir method. If the ruby process has inappropriate privileges, the attacker can create a file/directory at any directory."
  },
  "CVE-2018-8779": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The UNIXServer.open and UNIXSocket.open methods in Ruby do not properly check for NULL bytes in the path argument of a socket, allowing for unintended socket creation or access.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Improper input validation",
     "Unintended socket creation or access"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially connect to an unintended socket or create a socket in an unintended path by injecting a NULL byte into a socket's path.",
    "Attack vectors": "Exploitation involves manipulating the path argument supplied to the UNIXServer.open or UNIXSocket.open methods to include a null byte character.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to control or influence the path argument passed to the vulnerable functions. If a script accepts external input as an argument of one of these methods, an attacker could control the path."
  },
 "CVE-2018-8778": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The String#unpack method in Ruby does not properly handle a large number passed with the specifier @, which can lead to a buffer under-read.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
     "Buffer under-read",
      "Information disclosure"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can trigger an out-of-buffer read and potentially disclose data on the heap if a Ruby script accepts external input as an argument of the String#unpack method.",
    "Attack vectors": "This vulnerability is triggered when a large number is passed with the specifier @ to the String#unpack method while the code handles tainted strings improperly.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to control the format string passed to the `String#unpack` method."
  },
 "CVE-2018-8777": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The WEBrick server in Ruby does not properly handle large HTTP requests, leading to excessive memory consumption.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Denial of Service (DoS)",
      "Memory exhaustion"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a denial of service by sending large HTTP requests with crafted headers or bodies, leading to excessive memory usage and potentially crashing the WEBrick server.",
     "Attack vectors": "Exploitation involves passing a large HTTP request with a crafted header or body to a WEBrick server.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to send network requests to a vulnerable WEBrick server. No specific authentication or user privileges are needed."
  },
  "CVE-2018-8780": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Some methods in the Dir module in Ruby do not properly check for NULL bytes in their parameter.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Directory traversal",
         "Improper input validation"
    ],
     "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can cause unintentional directory traversal and may create or access files or directories at arbitrary locations.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by passing a path with null bytes to vulnerable methods in the Dir module.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to control or influence the path argument passed to the vulnerable methods in the Dir module."
  },
    "CVE-2018-16395": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The OpenSSL::X509::Name equality check in Ruby does not work correctly, potentially leading to incorrect verification of X.509 certificate names.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
     "Improper validation",
     "Incorrect name comparison"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Non-equal X509 names may be evaluated to be equal leading to the acceptance of illegitimate certificates. The attacker could then use these certificates in signing or encryption operations.",
    "Attack vectors": "By crafting certificates with carefully constructed X509 names an attacker could exploit the improper comparison.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to create an illegitimate certificate with a crafted X509 name. No specific privileges or authentication are required."
  },
  "CVE-2018-16396": {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Tainted flags are not properly propagated in Array#pack and String#unpack methods when used with specific directives.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Tainted data not propagated",
        "Data integrity issues"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Tainted data might be processed unsafely. Untrusted input is not marked as tainted when using certain format directives in Array#pack and String#unpack.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by unpacking a tainted string or by using the Array#pack method with certain directives, and then using the unpacked or packed data without proper sanitization.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position":"The attacker needs to be able to control or influence a tainted string that will be used by the vulnerable function."
