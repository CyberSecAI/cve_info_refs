- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of the `widgetID` variable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application's output, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions within the context of the user's browser.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can craft a malicious URL containing the malicious script in the `widgetID` variable. When a victim clicks this link, the script is reflected and executed in their browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs and lure victims to click on them. The attacker does not need to have any prior access to the application.
