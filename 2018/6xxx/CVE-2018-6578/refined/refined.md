Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `usr_plan` parameter when processing SQL queries in the Joomla! Component JE PayperVideo.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection.  The application directly incorporates the user-supplied `usr_plan` value into an SQL query without proper escaping or sanitization.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL commands into the database, potentially allowing them to:
        *   Extract sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, and other confidential data.
        *   Modify or delete data in the database.
        *   Gain control of the database server.
        *   Potentially compromise the entire Joomla! application.
    *   The proof-of-concept provided demonstrates how an attacker can extract the database user, database name, and database version through the SQL injection.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to the vulnerable URL, with the malicious SQL payload embedded within the `usr_plan` parameter.
        *   Specifically, `http://localhost/[PATH]/index.php?option=com_jepaypervideo&view=myplans&task=myplans.usersubscriptions`

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Joomla! application.
    *   No authentication is explicitly stated, suggesting that this vulnerability may be exploitable by unauthenticated users, though more information would be needed to confirm.
    *   The attacker must be able to craft a malicious SQL query and insert it into the `usr_plan` parameter.

**Summary:** The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Joomla! Component JE PayperVideo 3.0.0. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious SQL code via the `usr_plan` POST parameter, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or manipulating the database.
