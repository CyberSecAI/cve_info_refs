- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A vulnerability in the `secryptocfg export` command of Brocade Fabric OS allows bypassing export file access restrictions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control, allowing unauthorized file copying.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker can initiate a file copy from the source to a remote system by bypassing access restrictions on the export file, potentially exfiltrating sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker must have local access to the Brocade Fabric OS command-line interface (CLI) and be able to execute the `secryptocfg export` command.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Local access to the Brocade Fabric OS CLI.
