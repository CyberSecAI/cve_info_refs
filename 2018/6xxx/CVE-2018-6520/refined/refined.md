- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The whitelisting mechanism for user-provided URLs used a flawed regular expression to extract the host information for validation. This regex did not properly account for the *authority* part of the URL, allowing attackers to craft URLs that would pass validation but redirect to a different, attacker-controlled host.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Insecure regular expression used for URL parsing and host extraction.
    - Open redirection vulnerability due to insufficient validation of user-provided URLs.
    - Bypass of the whitelisting mechanism.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can craft URLs that bypass the whitelisting mechanism, leading to open redirection. This can be used for phishing attacks, where users are redirected to malicious sites under the guise of legitimate ones.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious URL that exploits the flawed regex parsing to redirect to an attacker-controlled host. The crafted URL passes the whitelist check.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to craft a specific malicious URL that exploits the vulnerable regex to bypass the whitelisting mechanism.
