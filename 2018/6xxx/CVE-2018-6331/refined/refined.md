Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6331:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `buck parser-cache` command in Buck was vulnerable due to its use of Java serialized objects for loading and saving state. The deserialization process was not properly restricted, allowing for the possibility of arbitrary code execution if a malicious serialized object was loaded.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted deserialization of Java objects: The `ObjectInputStream` used by the `ParserCacheCommand` was not properly configured to only allow the deserialization of specific, trusted classes. This allowed for the possibility of attackers providing specially crafted serialized objects to trigger arbitrary code execution by exploiting Java deserialization vulnerabilities.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the machine running the `buck` command. This could lead to complete compromise of the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted parser cache data: An attacker could craft a malicious serialized Java object and inject it into the parser cache data. If an unsuspecting user loads this malicious cache data using the `buck parser-cache --load` command, the malicious object would be deserialized, leading to code execution.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create/modify parser cache data: The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious serialized object and somehow make the affected user load it through the `buck parser-cache` command with the `--load` option. This could be achieved by various means, such as:
  - Intercepting the parser cache data while in transit if transmitted.
  - If the user is running the `buck` command from a directory writable by the attacker.
  - Convincing the user to load the crafted data by trickery.

**Additional Details:**
The provided content includes a commit that addresses the vulnerability by introducing a `ParserStateObjectInputStream` which restricts deserialization to only `RemoteDaemonicParserState` objects. This effectively mitigates the vulnerability by preventing the deserialization of arbitrary objects.

The provided CVSS v3 base metrics are:
- Attack vector: Network
- Attack complexity: Low
- Privileges required: None
- User interaction: None
- Scope: Unchanged
- Confidentiality: High
- Integrity: High
- Availability: High

The overall score is 9.8, which corresponds to a "Critical" severity.
