NeoRecruit is a recruitment component. You can propose job and internship offers. The offers are classified in various categories and are allotted to a recruiter to which you can give access to the management of his offers from the website.

NeoRecruit it is not simply a system which presents offers, it makes it possible to recover the CV and the covering letters of the applicants when they apply to an offer or when they submit an unsolicited application. Then, the recruiter will receive all the details of the application by email, and he will find all these informations on the website. You thus create a true CV database, manageable from the backend or the frontend for recruiters.

Furthermore, the component has its own multi criteria search form, that you can easily customize, without any technical knowledge. You will also find many options in the configuration panel of the component to customize the lists of offers, the offer page and the application forms.

You can manage the offers for your company, or you can let your customers or members publish their own offers. They will also be able to manage the applications from their user account.

NeoRecruit is a commercial component, available in english, french, spanish and german. Three modules are also available with the component : NeoRecruit Categories, NeoRecruit Latest Offers and NeoRecruit Search Offers.

Not necessary to read because component is very intuitive. Documentation was good also and all features are display in good manner.

Absolutely. I searched a lot which component will be the best for recruitment needs and this one is simply the best one I found.

###### Functionality

Yes is great! It has all necessary functionality for jobs recruitment sites.

Amazing support Raphael is very helpful and made several modifications to the core software for me.

Great yes and support is available for any questions you may have.

Yes great value for money! And a lifetime license! Amazing value! :)

I used this to:
Ive used several joomla jobs/recruitment extensions in the past which was VERY disapointed with, neorecruit is absolutely great! The only usable joomla extensions for jobs/recruitment!

#### [Great functionality for small and medium businesses](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/ads-a-affiliates/jobs-a-recruitment/neorecruit/#rev-101415)

[Alexander Lenz (4).](/profile/profile/details/113060)

###### Functionality

This component offers more than just displaying a list of job offers. It helps to reduce the communication efforts aswell.

###### Ease of use

After about 10 minutes the component is ready to be filled with jobs in different sections. There is no much time needed to get familiar.

###### Support

I had a very great experiance with the developers support. He even helped me to get the component´s design work with my template - THANK YOU

###### Documentation

Everything that is needed to get this component started is well described and the UI is intuitively designed. Not too much - nothing missing

###### Value for money

It is good a developer gets some money for their work. Here the money is a good investment.

I used this to:
The companies job offers are displayed with this component. The only thing that is really missing are multilanguage capabilities. But I´m sure this will come with one of the next updates, ;-)

#### [Decent Component and Great Support](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/ads-a-affiliates/jobs-a-recruitment/neorecruit/#rev-87543)

###### Functionality

Overall it has everything my client needed to run a job board, so excelent.

###### Ease of use

Fairly easy to set-up and customise once you find where everything is.

###### Support

Fantastic support! There were some small bugs on the new release and the developer was super fast to respond and fix then for us.

###### Value for money

It's not a cheap component, but given it works well out of the box and the support is great I think it's a fair price.

I used this to:
Client job board in a recruitment agency.

#### [This component has not much funtionality](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/ads-a-affiliates/jobs-a-recruitment/neorecruit/#rev-3477)

[Nelke (6).](/profile/profile/details/219368)

Posted on 11 September 2013

This component does not have much functionality

The component is too expensive for the little Funkionlität.

Since the somewhat appealing and partly responsive design can not justify the price.

The component is ok for a internal company job offer ... but not more.

In this directory you get also non-commercial components with similar functionality.

I never publish comments but as Raphael, the component editor, helped me a lot, I think I can post a comment to show him my gratitude.

Since 2008, I have used the component and I've never had any problem until early February 2013 when I updated the component, it did not work very well afterwards.

Our site generates hundreds of thousands of visitors, dysfontionnement was very annoying and Raphael gave us a free outstanding support.

Today everything is back in order, offers are published on a daily basis and candidates apply every day without any problem.

Congratulations and long life to Recruit Neo.

I have this product since 2008 (Joomla 1.5) until now (Joomla 5.2).

Easy to install, easy to operate.

Great works, is stable.

Support has always been very good.

I never had a problem when the error has always been resolved up to 1 day up to 2 days.

thank you

For a Client i had evaluate JobBoard before. It is also a goog component, but the publishing date couldnt change in the backend nor in the frontend. I switched to Neorecruit. It was very easy to setup. Now he can change the publishing date. Also very fine are the url's. The are taken from the categories and title.

What i'm missing are the social plugins. I asked the support and they said this feature is planned, but if needed urgently, they can help me out.

Cheers

For years i am working with NeoRecruit and in the beginning it was a very handy coded Jobs system.

Latest years development is slow, too slow and the support is dramatic (i never receive feedback or a solution to my problemm i asked them on their website) response is very slow (weeks +)

I am switching to another component soon!

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
