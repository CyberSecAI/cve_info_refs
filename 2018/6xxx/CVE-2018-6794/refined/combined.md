### Suricata 3.x.x and 4.x.x do not parse HTTP responses if tcp data was sent before 3-way-handshake completed

Added by [ajaxtpm ajaxtpm](/users/792) [about 7 years](/projects/suricata/activity?from=2018-01-25 "01/25/2018 11:47 AM") ago.
Updated [over 4 years](/projects/suricata/activity?from=2020-09-01 "09/01/2020 10:35 AM") ago.

Status:ClosedPriority:NormalAssignee:[Victor Julien](/users/4)Target version:[4.1beta1](/versions/105 "03/23/2018")
Affected Versions:Label:CVE:[2018-6794](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-6794)Git IDs:

e1ef57c848bbe4e567d5d4b66d346a742e3f77a1

Severity:Disclosure Date:

---

**Description**

If we break a normal tcp packets flow order and send data before client sends ACK packet and thus complete tcp 3whs then both currently active Suricata versions will not recognize it as HTTP response data. The impact is a complete http response signatures bypass - if an attacker is close to a web client enough he can spoof http response from a legitimate server and send an exploit payload instead of legitimate one and this attack will no be detected by IDS signatures.

Such TCP packets scheme looks as the following:
```
Client    ->  [SYN] [Seq=0 Ack= 0]           ->  Evil Server     # Client starts a TCP 3-way handshake
Client    <-  [SYN, ACK] [Seq=0 Ack= 1]      <-  Evil Server     # Server responses as it should, but ...
Client    <-  [PSH, ACK] [Seq=1 Ack= 1]      <-  Evil Server     # It sends HTTP response before the 3whs is completed
Client    <-  [FIN, ACK] [Seq=83 Ack= 1]     <-  Evil Server     # Moreover it finishes TCP session
Client    ->  [ACK] [Seq=1 Ack= 84]          ->  Evil Server     # Client finishes TCP 3whs by sending ACK packet and confirms data from server
Client    ->  [PSH, ACK] [Seq=1 Ack= 84]     ->  Evil Server     # Then it sends a HTTP GET request as nothing wrong happened

```

In spite of broken TCP flow client accepts "injected" data from server and process it as a normal HTTP Response. Browsers and cli tools like wget/curl were confirmed to process this normally.

If we apply the following signatures agains PCAP file in attachment:
```
alert tcp any any -> any any (msg: "TCP BEEN RULE"; content: "been"; sid: 5; )
alert http any any -> any any (msg: "HTTP BEEN RULE"; content: "been"; sid: 6; )
alert tcp any any -> any any (msg: "TCP GET RULE"; content: "GET"; sid: 7; )
alert http any any -> any any (msg: "HTTP GET RULE"; content: "GET"; sid: 8; )

```

We will see only sids 5, 7 and 8 in alerts log file.

Also we see no sid 2260001 alert ("SURICATA Applayer Wrong direction first Data") there.

stream: still inspect packets dropped by stream

```
The detect engine would bypass packets that are set as dropped. This
seems sane, as these packets are going to be dropped anyway.

However, it lead to the following corner case: stream events that
triggered the drop could not be matched on the rules. The packet
with the event wouldn't make it to the detect engine due to the bypass.

This patch changes the logic to not bypass DROP packets anymore.
Packets that are dropped by the stream engine will set the no payload
inspection flag, so avoid needless cost.

-----------------------------------------------------
Vulnerability Type: Detection Bypass
Affected Product: Suricata
Vulnerable version: <4.0.4
CVE number: CVE-2018-6794
Found: 25.01.2018
By: Kirill Shipulin (@kirill_wow), Positive Technologies
Severity: Medium
------------------------------------------

About Suricata:
---------------
Suricata is a high performance Network Threat Detection, IDS, IPS and Network Security Monitoring engine. Open Source and owned by a community run non-profit foundation, the Open Information Security Foundation (OISF). Suricata is developed by the OISF, its supporting vendors and the community

Attack Description:
-------------------
If as a server side you break a normal TCP 3 way handshake packets order and inject some response data before 3whs is complete then data still will be received by the a client but some IDS engines may skip content checks on that.

Attack scenario TCP flow scheme:
Client    ->  [SYN] [Seq=0 Ack= 0]           ->  Evil Server
Client    <-  [SYN, ACK] [Seq=0 Ack= 1]      <-  Evil Server
Client    <-  [PSH, ACK] [Seq=1 Ack= 1]      <-  Evil Server  # Injection before the 3whs is completed
Client    <-  [FIN, ACK] [Seq=83 Ack= 1]     <-  Evil Server
Client    ->  [ACK] [Seq=1 Ack= 84]          ->  Evil Server
Client    ->  [PSH, ACK] [Seq=1 Ack= 84]     ->  Evil Server

IDS signature checks for tcp stream or http response body will be skipped in the case of data injection. This attack technique requires all three packets from a malicious server to be received by a client side together before it completes 3whs. Proof of concept server was written in C to reproduce this and it works reliably in local networks. Since some network devices may affect packets transmission exploitation is not so reliable for the internet scenario.

This attack possibly may impact other network monitoring or intrusion detection systems because is not limited to Suricata IDS: an old Snort IDS version 2.9.4 is also affected.

Successful exploitation leads to a complete TCP-Stream response or HTTP response signatures bypass and may be used to prevent malicious payloads from network detection.

PoС:
----
A Working PoC server is available here: https://github.com/kirillwow/ids_bypass
There is also a traffic capture of this data injection technique.

Timeline Summary:
-----------------
2018-01-25: Issue submitted to the bug tracker.
2018-01-30: Patch ready.
2018-02-14: Suricata 4.0.4 containing the fix has been released.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Package        : suricata
Version        : 2.0.7-2+deb8u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-7177 CVE-2017-15377 CVE-2018-6794
Debian Bug     : 856648 889842 856649

Several issues were found in suricata, an intrusion detection and
prevention tool.

CVE-2017-7177

    Suricata has an IPv4 defragmentation evasion issue caused by lack
    of a check for the IP protocol during fragment matching.

CVE-2017-15377

    It was possible to trigger lots of redundant checks on the content
    of crafted network traffic with a certain signature, because of
    DetectEngineContentInspection in detect-engine-content-inspection.c.
    The search engine doesn't stop when it should after no match is
    found; instead, it stops only upon reaching inspection-recursion-
    limit (3000 by default).

CVE-2018-6794

    Suricata is prone to an HTTP detection bypass vulnerability in
    detect.c and stream-tcp.c. If a malicious server breaks a normal
    TCP flow and sends data before the 3-way handshake is complete,
    then the data sent by the malicious server will be accepted by web
    clients such as a web browser or Linux CLI utilities, but ignored
    by Suricata IDS signatures. This mostly affects IDS signatures for
    the HTTP protocol and TCP stream content; signatures for TCP packets
    will inspect such network traffic as usual.

TEMP-0856648-2BC2C9 (no CVE assigned yet)

    Out of bounds read in app-layer-dns-common.c.
    On a zero size A or AAAA record, 4 or 16 bytes would still be read.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
2.0.7-2+deb8u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your suricata packages.
