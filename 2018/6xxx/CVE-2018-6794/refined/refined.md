{
  "CVE-2018-6794": {
    "Description": "Suricata is prone to an HTTP detection bypass vulnerability. If a malicious server breaks a normal TCP flow and sends data before the 3-way handshake is complete, the data sent by the malicious server will be accepted by web clients but ignored by Suricata IDS signatures.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to Suricata not properly handling TCP packets received before the TCP 3-way handshake is complete.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of TCP packets received out of order.",
      "Failure to recognize HTTP responses sent before the completion of the TCP 3-way handshake."
     ],
    "Impact": "Complete bypass of HTTP response signatures, allowing attackers to inject malicious payloads undetected by Suricata.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious server sends HTTP response data to a client before completing the TCP 3-way handshake.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be in a position to send spoofed TCP packets and needs to be close enough to the web client to inject data before the 3-way handshake is completed."
