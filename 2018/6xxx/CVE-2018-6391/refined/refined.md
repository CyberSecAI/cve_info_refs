Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**CVE ID:** While the provided content doesn't explicitly mention CVE-2018-6391, it does detail a CSRF vulnerability in Netis WF2419 router which is likely related.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The root cause is a lack of CSRF protection in the Netis WF2419 router's web interface. Specifically, the `netcore_set.cgi` script doesn't validate the origin of requests, allowing for malicious cross-site requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The primary vulnerability is CSRF. The router's web interface is susceptible to unauthorized actions performed on behalf of an authenticated user without their consent or knowledge.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Configuration Manipulation:** An attacker can erase the Address Reservation List, causing misconfiguration of the router.
*   **Client-Side Account Theft:** Attackers can use redirects or phishing to steal client-side accounts.
*   **Malicious Redirects:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites.
*   **Manipulation of Application Functions:** Non-persistent manipulation of router functions is possible.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Embedded HTML:** The vulnerability can be exploited by embedding malicious HTML code in a website or email that the user visits.
*   **External Redirects:** Attackers can redirect users from legitimate sites to malicious pages.
*   **Client Side:**  The attack vector is on the client-side of the router firmware.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote:** The attacker can be remote.
*   **No Privileged User Account:**  No privileged web application user account is needed.
*   **Medium or High User Interaction:** The user must interact with the malicious HTML (e.g. by visiting the page with the malicious code)

**Technical Details:**

The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates how a simple HTML form can be used to trigger the vulnerability:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <form action="http://192.168.10.2/cgi-bin-igd/netcore_set.cgi"
method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="mode&#95;name" value="netcore&#95;set" />
      <input type="hidden" name="reserve&#95;address&#95;set" value="1" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

This form, when loaded in a user's browser while they are logged into the router, sends a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint `/cgi-bin-igd/netcore_set.cgi` with specific parameters that cause the Address Reservation List to be erased.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit-db entry indicates the router version affected is Netis WF2419, V2.2.36123.
*   The exploit is classified as a "webapps" vulnerability on "Hardware" platform.
*   The exploit uses a GET request method.
