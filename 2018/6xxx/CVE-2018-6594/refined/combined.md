# Attack on PyCrypto's ElGamal Encryption with Proof-of-Concept (PoC) #253

## Description

[![@weikengchen](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14937807?u=5a6d940a1d1890b929697a6c657d4d660919c9e8&v=4&size=48)](/weikengchen)[weikengchen](https://github.com/weikengchen)opened [on Feb 2, 2018](https://github.com/pycrypto/pycrypto/issues/253#issue-293779836)

Joint work with [@TElgamal](https://github.com/TElgamal).

We attack [PyCrypto](https://github.com/dlitz/pycrypto/).

The textbook ElGamal implementation is not secure. PyCrypto, and its relevant implementations, PyCryptodome, and libgcrypt, use the wrong algorithm.

I would give the basic idea as follows. Readers with modern algebra background can jump to [@TElgamal](https://github.com/TElgamal) 's explanation [here](https://github.com/Legrandin/pycryptodome/issues/90#issuecomment-362217114).

## **The wrong implementation has two messages classes.**

Due to technical reasons, all messages are classified into two classes. A random message belongs to one of them (with 50% 50% possibility).

[![two_message_classes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14937807/35717581-0ef9bf16-0795-11e8-871e-a098c1ebb80c.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14937807/35717581-0ef9bf16-0795-11e8-871e-a098c1ebb80c.png)

In some applications, there are only several possible messages. Consider we are sending a military message. There are only two outcomes: the army moved forward or retracted. With a high possibility, they belong to different classes.

## **Encrypt the two messages.**

We now encrypt two messages with ElGamal.

[![encrypt_message](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14937807/35717704-bb596aa4-0795-11e8-9e68-41484304765b.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14937807/35717704-bb596aa4-0795-11e8-9e68-41484304765b.png)

The encrypted result is called a ciphertext. It should reveal NO information about the original message.

## **Expectation: encrypted message has indistinguishability.**

We expect a secure encryption scheme to provide message indistinguishability. No adversary can learn what is encrypted inside the ciphertext better than a random guess.

[![message_ind](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14937807/35718018-4a85f5f2-0797-11e8-88da-a6df08153b1f.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14937807/35718018-4a85f5f2-0797-11e8-88da-a6df08153b1f.png)

Let us assume the headquarter sent the second message -- no adversary should to able to learn.

## **Truth: the adversary can distinguish messages in two different classes.**

Due to the wrong implementation, the adversary can distinguish messages in different classes.

[![truth](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14937807/35718185-2dd16828-0798-11e8-9305-df72ff2a8571.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14937807/35718185-2dd16828-0798-11e8-9305-df72ff2a8571.png)

If the outcomes differ in which classes they belong to, then an adversary can infer more information.

## **Proof-of-Concept (PoC).**

We release our attack code in this GitHub repo: <https://github.com/TElgamal/attack-on-pycrypto-elgamal>

A running trace is collected by Travis CI: <https://travis-ci.org/TElgamal/attack-on-pycrypto-elgamal/builds/336735857>

Showing that our adversary makes 0% mistakes in guessing the messages if the two outcomes differ in the classes they belong to.

## **Discussion**

The problem can be fixed by using ElGamal carefully on the correct algebra group. Some results are given by [@TElgamal](https://github.com/TElgamal) and me on issue [Legrandin/pycryptodome#90](https://github.com/Legrandin/pycryptodome/issues/90) .

This bug is prevalent. It exists in PyCryptodome and libgcrypt (if used directly to encrypt messages).

Hash: SHA256

Package        : python-crypto
Version        : 2.6-4+deb7u8
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-6594
Debian Bug     : 889999

python-crypto generated weak ElGamal key parameters, which allowed attackers to
obtain sensitive information by reading ciphertext data (i.e., it did not have
semantic security in face of a ciphertext-only attack).

For Debian 7 "Wheezy", these problems have been fixed in version
2.6-4+deb7u8.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-crypto packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# Attack on the ElGamal implementation in PyCrypto

*UPDATE:* PyCrypto's implementation does not only allow chosen-plaintext attacks, but also ciphertext-only attacks. In some sense, this is what our source code already does anyways. More precisely, the attacker computes the Legendre symbol of the ciphertext and correlates with the Legendre symbols of the public key and Elgamal's random coin ($g^r$).

Here is the original README:

Chosen-plaintext attack on the ElGamal implementation in PyCrypto

All versions of PyCrypto generate weak key parameters. Specifically, Elgamal encryption takes places over Z\*\_p where the DDH does not hold. By computing the Legendre symbol, the attacker breaks IND-CPA.

# PyCrypto: Weak key generation — GLSA **202007-62**

A flaw in PyCrypto allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive
information.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-python/pycrypto** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **2.6.1-r2** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

### Background

PyCrypto is the Python Cryptography Toolkit.

### Description

It was discovered that PyCrypto incorrectly generated ElGamal key
parameters.

### Impact

Attackers may be able to obtain sensitive information by reading
ciphertext data.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

Gentoo has discontinued support for PyCrypto. We recommend that users
unmerge PyCrypto:

# emerge --unmerge “dev-python/pycrypto”

NOTE: The Gentoo developer(s) maintaining PyCrypto have discontinued
support at this time. PyCryptodome is the canonical successor to
PyCrypto.
