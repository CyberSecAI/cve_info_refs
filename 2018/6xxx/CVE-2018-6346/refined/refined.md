Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6346:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Proxygen's handling of invalid HTTP2 priority settings, specifically circular dependencies in the priority settings. The HTTP2 codec could enter an invalid state after processing a header with such invalid priorities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation: The code doesn't properly validate HTTP2 priority settings, allowing for circular dependencies.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The vulnerability leads to a potential denial-of-service issue by causing the HTTP2 codec to enter an invalid state which could lead to the service becoming unavailable.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: An attacker can send specially crafted HTTP2 requests with invalid priority settings over the network to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP2 requests to the vulnerable Proxygen server. No special privileges or user interaction is required.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix for this issue involves checking for circular dependencies in the HTTP2 priority settings and returning a `PROTOCOL_ERROR` if such a dependency is detected.
- The fix is implemented in commit `52cf331743ebd74194d6343a6c2ec52bb917c982` of the facebook/proxygen repository.
- The vulnerability affects Proxygen prior to version v2018.12.31.00.
- The provided code diff shows the code changes that were implemented to fix the vulnerability.
