{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists in McAfee Application and Change Control (MACC). Executable files from a hard drive solidified by MACC, of an external system, can be executed on the system that did not generate the inventory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of solidified executable files",
     "Inadequate validation of the source of executable files"
    ],
    "impact": "Compromise of the Human-Machine Interface (HMI) and by extension the drive system.  Malicious files transferred via removable USB storage can be executed, potentially leading to unauthorized control or data manipulation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local attack using removable USB storage devices"
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs local access to the HMI and the ability to transfer malicious files via USB storage devices. The attacker needs to have the executable files from a hard drive solidified by MACC, of an external system."
  },
  "affected_products": [
    "SINAMICS PERFECT HARMONY GH180 Drives with HMIs produced between November 4th, 2015 and October 9th, 2018, using MACC, specifically when option A30 was part of the order"
    ],
  "remediation": "Upgrade to MACC V8.2.0 or greater using recommendations from McAfee. Protect local access to the drive, ensure USB based storage media is blank and malware free before connecting to the drive and Apply cell protection concept and implement Defense-in-Depth.",
  "additional_notes": "Siemens recommends the installation of MACC 8.2.0 instead of version 8.0.0, hotfix 5 as mentioned in SB10250. This vulnerability affects HMIs with MACC installed and can be exploited by transferring malicious files via USB storage devices."
