SUMMARY

McAfee has issued Security Bulletin SB10250 to address a vulnerabilty in McAfee Application and
Change Control (MACC). SINAMICS PERFECT HARMONY GH180 Drives with HMIs produced between
November 4th, 2015 and October 9th, 2018, use MACC as part of their software package, if option A30
was part of the order.

Siemens has analyzed the vulnerability and has determined that this vulnerability applies to these HMIs.

HMIs with this vulnerability can be compromised via local attack using removable USB storage devices to
transfer malicious ﬁles. These ﬁle can be executed to compromise the HMI and by extension the drive
system.

For compatibility reasons, Siemens advises the installation of MACC 8.2.0 instead of version 8.0.0, hotﬁx
5 as mentioned in SB10250.
