- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Easy Hosting Control Panel (EHCP) allows a user to change the password for a database user without verifying the original password or using any other form of authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unverified password change.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could change the database user's password, thereby gaining the privileges associated with that user, leading to unauthorized access and control of the database.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by accessing the EHCP interface and using the functionality to change a database user's password through `index.php?op=dbedituser&id=[user_id]`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs network access to the EHCP interface to exploit the vulnerability. The attack can be performed locally if the attacker has local network access.
