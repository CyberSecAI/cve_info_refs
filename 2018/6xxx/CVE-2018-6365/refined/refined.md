Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6365:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in TSiteBuilder 1.0.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization or parameterization when constructing SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. The following files are vulnerable:
- index.php (login page)
- site.php (likely related to displaying individual site content)
- pagelist.php (likely related to listing pages)
- page_new.php (likely related to creating new pages)

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:
- Bypass authentication: By injecting SQL in the login form (index.php), they can log in as any user.
- Retrieve sensitive information: Using SQL injection in site.php, pagelist.php, and page_new.php, they can potentially access the database and extract usernames, passwords, and other data.
- Modify or delete data: They can also use SQL injection to manipulate the website's data, potentially altering content, or deleting data.
- Potentially gain full control: Depending on the database permissions, the attacker might be able to execute arbitrary code on the database server and potentially the web server itself.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vectors are HTTP requests targeting specific PHP pages, injecting SQL code into parameters within those requests. The identified entry points are:
- The login form in `index.php`
- The `id` parameter in `site.php`
- The `id` parameter in `pagelist.php`
- The `id` parameter in `page_new.php`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target web server hosting the vulnerable TSiteBuilder instance.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated before exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability.
- Basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.
- The web server must be accessible to the attacker via network.

**Additional technical details:**
The exploit-db entry provides example SQL injection payloads that can be used to exploit the vulnerability, including a detailed payload for site.php demonstrating how to extract database related information. The provided example uses a union-based SQL injection.
