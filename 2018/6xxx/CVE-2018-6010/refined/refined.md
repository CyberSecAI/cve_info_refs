Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2018-6010:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the `yii\web\ErrorHandler` displaying the exception message directly in the response, even when `YII_DEBUG` is disabled and no custom error action is configured, instead of displaying a generic message. This behavior occurs specifically during AJAX requests where the response format is set to `Response::FORMAT_HTML`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is that the system leaks potentially sensitive information included within exception messages when `YII_DEBUG` is turned off, which is contrary to the intended behavior of hiding detailed error information in production environments.
- **Inconsistent Error Handling:** The `ErrorHandler` behaves inconsistently depending on the request type (AJAX vs non-AJAX) when debug mode is off.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive internal information, such as database connection strings, file paths, or other configuration details, if these details are inadvertently included in exception messages. This information could then be leveraged for further attacks.
- The leaked information can aid attackers in understanding the internal workings of the application, which can lead to more targeted attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **AJAX Request:** The vulnerability is triggered specifically through AJAX requests with `Response::FORMAT_HTML` set. By making such a request to a page that throws an exception, the attacker can view the exception message in the response body when debug mode is off.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make AJAX requests to the target application. No special privileges are needed beyond being able to send web requests to the application.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have privileged access to the system. The vulnerability can be triggered from any request that results in an exception.

**Additional details:**
- The fix implemented in commit `6b0be47e0fa9c532e03b07b4369050582fcf5c7a` addresses this issue by ensuring that a generic error message "An internal server error occurred." is displayed when `YII_DEBUG` is disabled and the request is AJAX, and not revealing the exception message.
- The fix includes changes to `framework/base/ErrorHandler.php`, `framework/log/Dispatcher.php`, `framework/views/errorHandler/exception.php` and `tests/framework/log/DispatcherTest.php`.
- The issue was initially reported in issue #14711 and resolved via pull request #15534.
