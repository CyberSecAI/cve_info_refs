Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6313:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization when modifying page content in the wbcms admin panel. Specifically, the application fails to prevent the injection of malicious code when using the "source mode".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. The application allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into the page content through the source mode editor.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of the victim's browser when they view the affected page. This can result in various malicious activities, including:
    *   Stealing user session cookies
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user
    *   Defacing the website
    *   Other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the wbcms admin panel.
*   Specifically, the "Pages" modification section allows content editing.
*   The attacker utilizes the source mode editor within this section to insert malicious JavaScript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have valid admin credentials to log into the wbcms administration panel.
*   The attacker must be able to access and modify pages within the admin panel, specifically using the source code editing mode.

**Additional Information:**

* The provided content includes an example payload ` <img src=x onerror=alert(0)>` used to demonstrate the XSS vulnerability.
* The screenshots highlight the steps involved in injecting the payload and its execution, resulting in an alert box on the target page.
