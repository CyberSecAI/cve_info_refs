{
  "CVE-2018-6222": {
    "Root cause": "The location of log files can be changed in the logConfiguration.do page. The MimeBuildServer logs can be controlled by an attacker through the web interface",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper restriction of log file location.",
      "Improper input handling for log configuration."
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote command execution as root.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attacker first redirects the MimeBuildServer logs to a web-accessible location and then inserts arbitrary JSP code into the MimeBuilder configuration. Upon service restart, the crafted JSP is written to the log file, allowing for command execution through web request.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Requires an authenticated user to access the log configuration page to change the log file path and to update the MimeBuilder configuration."
  }
