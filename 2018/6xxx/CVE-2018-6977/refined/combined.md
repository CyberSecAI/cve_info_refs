VMware Fusion 10.x
VMware Workstation Player 14.x (Linux)

#### Resolution

The following steps should be followed to disable 3D acceleration feature on VMware Workstation and VMware Fusion

**For Fusion:**
1. Shutdown the Virtual Machine.
2. From the VMware Fusion menu bar, select **Window** > **Virtual Machine Library**.
3. Select a virtual machine and click **Settings**.
4. In the **Settings** Window, in the **System Settings** section, select **Display**.
5. Uncheck **Accelerate 3D graphics**.

**For Workstation:**
1. Shutdown the virtual machine.
2. Select the virtual machine and select **VM** > **Settings**.

##### 1. Summary

VMware ESXi, Workstation, and Fusion workarounds address a denial-of-service vulnerability

##### 2. Relevant Products

* VMware vSphere ESXi (ESXi)
* VMware Workstation Pro / Player (Workstation)
* VMware Fusion Pro, Fusion (Fusion)

##### 3. Problem Description

**Denial-of-service vulnerability in 3D-acceleration feature**

VMware ESXi, Workstation and Fusion contain a denial-of-service vulnerability due to an infinite loop in a 3D-rendering shader. Successfully exploiting this issue may allow an attacker with normal user privileges in the guest to make the VM unresponsive, and in some cases, possibly result other VMs on the host or the host itself becoming unresponsive.

Because many graphics API's and hardware lack pre-emption support, a specially crafted 3D shader may loop for an infinite amount of time and lock up a VM's virtual graphics device. Such a shader cannot always be validated by VMware hypervisors, since it may be well-formed but still cause problems if designed to run for an extremely long time. In such cases, VMware hypervisors then rely on the host's graphics driver to ensure that other users of 3D graphics on the host are not impacted by the malicious VM. However, many graphics drivers may themselves get into to a denial-of-service condition caused by such infinite shaders, and as a result other VMs or processes running on the host might also be affected.

The workaround for this issue requires disabling the 3D-acceleration feature as documented in the Mitigation/Workaround column of the below table.

The issue can only be exploited if 3D-acceleration feature is enabled. It is not enabled by default on ESXi and is enabled by default on Workstation and Fusion. The 3D-acceleration settings can be reviewed as follows.

**ESXi**
 With Host Client or vCenter, go to the individual VM > configure >  hardware > video card >

3D Graphics --> Check if "3D Graphics" is enabled.
    OR

Go to individual VMX file and then check for "mks.enable3d", if the VMs have the option

"mks.enable3d=TRUE", then 3D-acceleration  feature is enabled

**Workstation**
   - Select virtual machine and select VM > Settings.
   - On the Hardware tab, select Display
    If the "Accelerate 3D graphics" is checked then 3D-acceleration feature is enabled.

 **Fusion**
   -From the VMware Fusion menu bar, select Window > Virtual Machine Library.
   -Select a virtual machine and click Settings.
   -In the Settings Window > select Display.
    If the "Accelerate 3D graphics" is checked then 3D-acceleration feature is enabled.

VMware would like to thank Piotr Bania of Cisco Talos for reporting this issue to us.
