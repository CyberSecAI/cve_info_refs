Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-6852:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `lcencvm.sys` module of Sophos SafeGuard products.
*   Specifically, it is triggered through a crafted input buffer sent via the IOCTL `0x80202298`.
*   This crafted input leads to the execution of `nt!memset` with user-controlled address as the destination.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Uncontrolled Memory Zeroing:** The core issue is the ability to force the kernel to zero out a memory region at an address controlled by the attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain SYSTEM level privileges on the local machine.
*   **Code Execution in SYSTEM Context:** By zeroing out the security descriptor pointer in the object header of a privileged process, the attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the SYSTEM user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker requires local access to the system.
*   **IOCTL Manipulation:** The attack is performed by sending crafted input buffers via the `0x80202298` IOCTL to the vulnerable driver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the system.
*   **Ability to Interact with Driver:** The attacker needs the capability to send IOCTLs to the `lcencvm.sys` driver.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit leverages a memory manipulation technique, specifically by zeroing out the security descriptor pointer within the object header of a privileged process, enabling code execution in SYSTEM context.
*   The vulnerability is similar to a technique discussed in the provided link <https://labs.nettitude.com/blog/analysing-the-null-securitydescriptor-kernel-exploitation-mitigation-in-the-latest-windows-10-v1607-build-14393/>, and affects Windows versions prior to Windows 10 v1607.
