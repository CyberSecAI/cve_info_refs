Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2018-6312:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a combination of a weak default password for a privileged account and the ability to enable the Telnet service via the web interface, which subsequently allows passwordless root login.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-   **CWE-521: Weak Password Requirements:** A privileged account ("foxconn") has a weak default password that is easily cracked via dictionary attacks
-   **CWE-284: Improper Access Control:** The web interface allows enabling of the Telnet service, which is not properly access-controlled
-   **CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password:** The root account has no password, implying a hardcoded or unset password.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-   **Full system compromise:** Attackers gain root access to the femtocell.
-   **Information disclosure:**  Attackers can access sensitive information, including user communications and IPsec keys.
-   **Code execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the device.
-   **Denial of Service:** Attackers may be able to render the device inoperable.
-   **Privilege escalation:** Attackers escalate from a web interface user to a full root privileged user

**Attack vectors:**
-   **Remote:** The attack is initiated by accessing the web management interface of the femtocell.
-   **Weak default password:** The attacker uses the easily guessed or cracked default password to access a privileged account.
-   **Telnet service:** The attacker uses the privileged account to enable the Telnet service via the web interface.
-   **Passwordless root login:** The attacker logs in to the root account via Telnet without requiring a password

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the femtocell to access its web interface.
-   **Basic password cracking skills:** The attacker needs to use basic brute force or dictionary attacks to crack the weak password.
-   **Knowledge of the web interface:** The attacker needs to know how to navigate the web interface to enable the Telnet service.

**Additional notes:**
-   The vulnerability is described as being present in Foxconn femtocell FEMTO AP-FC4064-T version AP\_GT\_B38\_5.8.3lb15-W47 LTE Build 15.
-   The "admin" account is not privileged, but another "foxconn" account has higher privileges with a weak password.
-   The Telnet service allows root login without a password, which is enabled via the web interface with the foxconn account.
-   The exploit can be automated, as the root password is blank.
-   The vulnerabilities have been patched by the vendor.
