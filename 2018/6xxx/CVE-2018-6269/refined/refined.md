Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2018-6269:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the NVIDIA Tegra kernel driver's input/output control (IOCTL) handling for user mode requests. Specifically, a non-trusted pointer dereference can be made.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Non-trusted pointer dereference vulnerability in the IOCTL handling mechanism.
- Insufficient validation of user-provided pointers.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
- Information disclosure
- Denial of service
- Escalation of privileges
- Code execution

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access is required.
- The vulnerability is triggered through user mode requests, specifically via IOCTL calls.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted IOCTL requests to the kernel driver.
- For some devices, the attacker needs to have low-level privileges.
- For other devices, the attacker only needs user privileges.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the NVIDIA Tegra kernel driver.
- It affects both NVIDIA Jetson TX1 and TX2 devices, though the documents address them separately.
- The vulnerability is present in the `tegra-se-elp` driver in SHIELD TV devices.
- The base CVSS v3 score is 8.8, indicating a high severity.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS vector of AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H which indicates:
    - Attack Vector (AV): Local
    - Attack Complexity (AC): Low
    - Privileges Required (PR): Low
    - User Interaction (UI): None
    - Scope (S): Changed
    - Confidentiality Impact (C): High
    - Integrity Impact (I): High
    - Availability Impact (A): High
