- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A vulnerability exists in the Brocade Fabric OS Secure Shell (SSH) implementation that allows a local attacker to manipulate environment variables.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the insecure handling of environment variables within the restricted configuration shell of the Brocade Fabric OS SSH implementation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** By injecting arbitrary environment variables, a local attacker can bypass the intended restrictions of the configuration shell. This could lead to unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or other malicious activities within the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have some level of access to the affected system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires local access to the Brocade Fabric OS and the ability to interact with its Secure Shell.
