Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-6394

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the 'invite_type' parameter of the InviteX component for Joomla.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `invite_type` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, enabling them to read, modify, or delete sensitive data. This could lead to data breaches, privilege escalation, or complete compromise of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the component's `index.php` file, specifically targeting the `invite_type` parameter with malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla instance. They do not need to be authenticated. The attacker only needs to know the location of the vulnerable component and its `index.php` file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable component is "InviteX" version 3.0.5, a Joomla extension for content sharing and invitations.
- The exploit-db entry provides a sample URL demonstrating the vulnerable parameter: `http://localhost/[PATH]/index.php?option=com_invitex&view=invites&invite_type=[SQL]&invite_anywhere=1`
- The exploit database entry also provides a sample exploit string which is a URL encoded string designed to be injected into the SQL query.
