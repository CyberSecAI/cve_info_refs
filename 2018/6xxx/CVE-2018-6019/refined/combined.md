# Content Injection in Samsung Display Solutions Application for Android [CVE-2018-6019]

[March 1, 2018March 1, 2018](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2018/03/01/content-injection-in-samsung-display-solutions-application-for-android-cve-2018-6019/) [nightwatchcyber](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/author/nightwatchcyber/)
[Advisories](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/category/advisories/)[Android](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/android/), [samsung](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/samsung/)

# Summary

**Samsung Display Solutions App for Android** did not use encryption (SSL) for information transmission, thus allowing an MITM attacker to inject their own content into the app. The vendor fixed this issue and users should install the latest version (**3.02 or above**). MITRE has assigned **CVE-2018-6019** to track this issue.

# Details

**Samsung** makes an Android application that allows users to browse B2B content related to Samsung’s display products. While performing network level testing, we discovered that the content shown in the app was loaded via server calls made by the application without any kind of encryption (SSL). This allowed an MITM attacker to inject their own content into the app.

To observe the issue on v3.01:

1. Install the application on the device.
2. Setup an MITM proxy but do not install the SSL certificate on the device (we used PacketCapture).
3. Start the proxy. At this point all network traffic will be going through the proxy with the SSL traffic being encrypted by a self-signed certificate which is not trusted by the device.
4. Open the app.
5. Go back to the proxy and observe captured traffic.

All testing was done on Android 7 and application version 3.01. Network captures were performed using an on-device proxy (PacketCapture) without a trusted SSL certificate.

Screenshots of captured traffic attached:

# Vendor Response

The vendor fixed this issue and users should install the latest version (**3.02 or above**).

# Content Injection in Samsung Display Solutions Application for Android [CVE-2018-6019]

[March 1, 2018March 1, 2018](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2018/03/01/content-injection-in-samsung-display-solutions-application-for-android-cve-2018-6019/) [nightwatchcyber](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/author/nightwatchcyber/)
[Advisories](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/category/advisories/)[Android](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/android/), [samsung](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/samsung/)

# Summary

**Samsung Display Solutions App for Android** did not use encryption (SSL) for information transmission, thus allowing an MITM attacker to inject their own content into the app. The vendor fixed this issue and users should install the latest version (**3.02 or above**). MITRE has assigned **CVE-2018-6019** to track this issue.

# Details

**Samsung** makes an Android application that allows users to browse B2B content related to Samsung’s display products. While performing network level testing, we discovered that the content shown in the app was loaded via server calls made by the application without any kind of encryption (SSL). This allowed an MITM attacker to inject their own content into the app.

To observe the issue on v3.01:

1. Install the application on the device.
2. Setup an MITM proxy but do not install the SSL certificate on the device (we used PacketCapture).
3. Start the proxy. At this point all network traffic will be going through the proxy with the SSL traffic being encrypted by a self-signed certificate which is not trusted by the device.
4. Open the app.
5. Go back to the proxy and observe captured traffic.

All testing was done on Android 7 and application version 3.01. Network captures were performed using an on-device proxy (PacketCapture) without a trusted SSL certificate.

Screenshots of captured traffic attached:

# Vendor Response

The vendor fixed this issue and users should install the latest version (**3.02 or above**).

# References

# Bounty Information

This issue was originally reported to the [Samsung Mobile Security Bounty Program](https://security.samsungmobile.com/rewardsProgram.smsb) but was deemed to be out of scope. However, after being transferred to the Display Solutions team, this issue qualified for the [Samsung TV Bounty Program](https://samsungtvbounty.com/).
