The provided content is related to CVE-2018-6019.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Samsung Display Solutions App for Android was transmitting data without encryption (SSL).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of encryption (SSL) during network communication. This allowed for a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker performing a MITM attack could inject arbitrary content into the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- MITM attack on the network traffic between the application and the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept and modify network traffic between the Android device and the server. This is typically achieved by being on the same network as the victim or by controlling a network node along the path.
- The attacker does not need to install a trusted SSL certificate on the device for a MITM attack to succeed.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was present in version 3.01 of the application.
- The vendor fixed the issue in version 3.02 and above by implementing SSL encryption
- Testing was performed using an on-device proxy (PacketCapture) without a trusted SSL certificate.
