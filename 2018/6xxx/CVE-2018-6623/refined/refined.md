The provided content describes a vulnerability in Hola VPN version 1.79.859, which is related to CVE-2018-6623.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the insecure service permissions assigned to the `hola_svc` and `hola_updater` services. These services have `SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS` rights granted to the "Everyone" group, which allows any unprivileged user to modify or overwrite the service executables.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure service permissions
- `SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS` is granted to the "Everyone" group for the `hola_svc` and `hola_updater` services.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can modify or overwrite the service executables with arbitrary code. When the service is started, the attacker's code will be executed with the privileges of the service's user, potentially leading to privilege escalation to SYSTEM level.

**Attack vectors:**
An unprivileged user can replace the original service executable with a malicious one.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have local access to the system where Hola VPN is installed.
- The attacker must have the ability to write to the service executable file path due to the `SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS` permission.
