{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Memory leak in coders/dcm.c due to overwriting pointers to allocated memory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory leak due to reassigning pointers without freeing previously allocated memory."
    ],
    "impact": "Memory leak, potentially leading to denial of service if repeated.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Processing specially crafted DICOM (DCM) image files."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Ability to provide a crafted DCM file to a system using ImageMagick."
  },
    "additional_notes": "The issue arises in the ReadDCMImage function within coders/dcm.c, where 'redmap', 'greenmap', and 'bluemap' are repeatedly allocated, but the old pointers are not freed when new ones are assigned. The provided code snippets show that the memory leak occurs when opening the crafted dcm files, and the issue is detected by AddressSanitizer."
