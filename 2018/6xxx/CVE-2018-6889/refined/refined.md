Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The TypeSetter CMS 5.1 application does not properly validate or sanitize the `Host` header in HTTP requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Host Header Injection: The application accepts and uses the value of the `Host` header without verification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Web Page Redirection: An attacker can manipulate the `Host` header to redirect users to a malicious site.
- Cache Poisoning: The vulnerability could be used to poison web caches, serving malicious content to users.
- Password Reset Attacks: An attacker may be able to leverage the host header injection in password reset flows.
- Application Modification: The attacker can potentially modify application behavior through the host header.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP Request Manipulation: The attacker alters the `Host` header of an HTTP request sent to the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and manipulate the `Host` header. This is typically possible from any network location that can reach the web server hosting the application.

**Technical Details**
The application processes the Host header without validation and uses the provided hostname to construct redirect URLs.
An attacker can send a crafted request like
```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: google.com
```
to force the application to generate a redirect to the attacker controlled host.

**Mitigation:**
The provided solution is to configure the application to only allow whitelisted host names.
