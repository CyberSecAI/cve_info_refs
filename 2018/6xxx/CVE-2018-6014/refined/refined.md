- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improperly configured `crossdomain.xml` file, which allows read access to all resources from any Flash player instance.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-domain policy misconfiguration. The `crossdomain.xml` file is overly permissive, granting access to all domains.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can craft a malicious SWF file to send read requests to the vulnerable application. This allows the attacker to retrieve sensitive user information.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed remotely by delivering a crafted SWF file to a user who interacts with the Subsonic application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to host a malicious SWF file and trick a user into accessing it in a Flash enabled browser while being logged into the vulnerable Subsonic instance.
