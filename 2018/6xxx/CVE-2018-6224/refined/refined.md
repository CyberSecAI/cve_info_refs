    "vulnerability": {
      "summary": "Trend Micro Email Encryption Gateway 5.5 (Build 1111.00) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).",
      "details": "The Trend Micro Email Encryption Gateway web interface lacks Anti-CSRF tokens in its forms, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.",
      "rootCause": "The web application does not implement proper CSRF protection mechanisms, such as the use of Anti-CSRF tokens.",
      "attackVectors": [
        "An attacker can craft malicious web pages that, when visited by an authenticated user, perform unauthorized actions on the vulnerable application."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Missing Anti-CSRF tokens."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can submit authenticated requests when an authenticated user browses an attacker-controlled domain. This can lead to remote command execution when chained with other vulnerabilities. For instance, it can be combined with CVE-2018-6222 to execute commands or used to force updates and exploit CVE-2018-6220 or CVE-2018-6221 to gain remote code execution.",
        "requiredCapabilities": [
        "The attacker needs to lure an authenticated user to visit a malicious webpage."
