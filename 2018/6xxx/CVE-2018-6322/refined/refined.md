Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6322:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an insecurely created named pipe (`\\.\pipe\PSANMSrvcPpal`) in Panda Global Security 17.0.1. This named pipe has a NULL DACL (Discretionary Access Control List).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **NULL DACL:** The primary vulnerability is the use of a NULL DACL on the named pipe. A NULL DACL grants full access to any user, bypassing normal security checks.
- **Insecurely Created Named Pipe:** The named pipe `\\.\pipe\PSANMSrvcPpal` is created without proper access controls, allowing any user to interact with it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A low-privileged user can gain elevated privileges by accessing and modifying the DACL of the pipe, or by impersonating the pipe.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Exploitation could potentially lead to a denial of service by interfering with the pipe's intended functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local. An attacker would need to have local access to the system where Panda Global Security 17.0.1 is installed.
- **Named Pipe Interaction:** The attacker would need to interact with the insecure named pipe (`\\.\pipe\PSANMSrvcPpal`) to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a low-privileged user account on the target system.
- The attacker must be able to interact with the file system, specifically with named pipes.
