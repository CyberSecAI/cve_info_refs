- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Inadequate input filtering in the Uri class (formerly JUri).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Execution of malicious scripts in the context of the user's browser.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability lies in the Uri class of the Joomla! CMS, which does not properly filter input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious input through the vulnerable `Uri` class, though the specific method is not detailed in this document.
