{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `irda_setsockopt` function in the IRDA subsystem of the Linux kernel incorrectly reinserts existing IAS objects into the LM_IAS database, corrupting the doubly linked list used for hashbin implementation. This, combined with a memory leak in `irda_bind`, leads to a use-after-free vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Incorrect handling of data structures",
      "Memory leak"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (system crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have local access to the system."
