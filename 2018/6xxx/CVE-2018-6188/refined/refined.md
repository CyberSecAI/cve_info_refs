Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-6188:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A regression in Django 1.11.8 caused the `AuthenticationForm` to execute its `confirm_login_allowed()` method even when an incorrect password was provided.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Leakage:** The `confirm_login_allowed()` method, when executed with an invalid password, could reveal sensitive information about a user.
*   Specifically, if `confirm_login_allowed()` was not overridden, an attacker could determine if a user account was set to `is_active=False`.
*   If `confirm_login_allowed()` was overridden, even more sensitive details could be leaked depending on the custom logic in that function.
*   The default authentication backend, `ModelBackend`, has been configured to reject inactive users since Django 1.10, but this behavior was circumvented by this bug.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could potentially gain information about the existence and status of user accounts (specifically, whether a user is inactive) on a Django-powered website.
*  If confirm_login_allowed() is overridden, more sensitive details could be leaked.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker would attempt to log in with an arbitrary username and an incorrect password.
*   The vulnerability lies in the handling of the login attempt before checking the validity of the credentials, which triggers `confirm_login_allowed()`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need any special privileges, and can be an unauthenticated user.
*   The attacker only requires network access to the Django application.

**Affected Versions:**

*   Django master branch
*   Django 2.0 and 2.0.1
*   Django 1.11.8 and 1.11.9

**Resolution:**

* The issue was resolved by fixing `AuthenticationForm` to not call `confirm_login_allowed()` on failed login attempts, but this introduced a caveat that 'This account is inactive' is no longer raised when an inactive user attempts to log in.
* Patches were released for Django's master branch, as well as the 2.0 and 1.11 release branches.
* Django 1.11.10 and 2.0.2 were released to address the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Jack Cushman.
*   Older Django versions (1.10, 1.9, 1.8) were not affected.
