Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2018-6268:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `libnvmmlite_video.so` component of the NVIDIA Tegra OpenMax driver (`libnvomx`). It involves referencing memory after it has been freed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Use-after-free vulnerability, which occurs when a program attempts to access memory that has already been released.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to:
* Denial of service (crashing the application or system).
* Escalation of privileges (allowing the attacker to gain higher level access).

**Attack Vectors:**
Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to have local access to the system and the ability to interact with the vulnerable `libnvomx` driver. User level privileges are sufficient for exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in NVIDIA Jetson TX1, TX2, and potentially other Tegra-based systems.
*   The issue is addressed in the R28.3 release of the Linux for Tegra (L4T) driver package for Jetson TX1 and TX2 devices, and R21.8 for Jetson TK1.
*   It also affects NVIDIA SHIELD TV devices and is fixed with SHIELD Experience Upgrade 8.0.
*   CVSS v3 score: 7.8, with vector string AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.
*   The vulnerability is located in the `libnvmmlite_video.so` library.
