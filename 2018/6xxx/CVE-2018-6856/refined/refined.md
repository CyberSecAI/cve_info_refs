{
  "CVE-2018-6856": {
    "Description": "Local Privilege Escalation via IOCTL 0x8020601C",
    "Root cause": "By crafting an input buffer, an attacker can control the execution path to write a global variable [lcencvm+0x6725c (8907d25c)] to a user-controlled address (0xF8F8F8F8).",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the IOCTL handler, allowing an attacker to redirect a write operation to an arbitrary memory address."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can gain SYSTEM privileges by exploiting the arbitrary write vulnerability. This allows them to execute arbitrary code within the kernel, ultimately allowing them to take complete control of the system.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "Local attacker crafts an input buffer and sends it to the vulnerable driver (lcencvm.sys) via the IOCTL 0x8020601C."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "The attacker must have local access to the system and the ability to send IOCTL requests to the vulnerable driver."
    ]
