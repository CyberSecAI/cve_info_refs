Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the CVE-2018-6383 vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an insufficient blacklist of file extensions in the file upload functionality of Monstra CMS. While common PHP extensions are blocked, the `.pht` and `.phar` extensions are not included in the blacklist.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Incomplete blacklist:** The application uses a blacklist to prevent the upload of files with specific extensions. However, this blacklist is incomplete.
*   **File upload vulnerability:**  The CMS allows authenticated users to upload files.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Due to the ability to upload files with the `.pht` or `.phar` extensions, which are executable by PHP, attackers can inject malicious code.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server by uploading a malicious file. This allows for complete compromise of the server.
*   **Full System Access:** With RCE, the attacker can gain complete control over the web server, access sensitive data, modify files, install malware, and other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **File Upload:** The primary attack vector is uploading a file with the `.pht` or `.phar` extension through the CMS's file management interface.
*   **Web Interface:** Exploitation occurs via the web interface of Monstra CMS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user, specifically an administrator or editor, with the ability to upload files.
*   **Access to the CMS:** The attacker must have network access to the Monstra CMS web application.
*   **Malicious file:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious PHP file with the `.pht` or `.phar` extension containing the desired payload.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The exploit code provided in the exploit database entry, uses python to exploit the vulnerability by first authenticating and then upload the malicious phar file.
*   The vulnerability exists because the web server's PHP configuration permits the execution of `.pht` and `.phar` files as PHP code. The default configuration of `libapache2-mod-php` allows execution of files with .pht extension and `libapache2-mod-php7.1` allows the execution of files with .phar extension.
*   The exploit script uses multipart form data to upload the file and uses cookies to authenticate.
*   The attacker can execute arbitrary commands by calling the uploaded shell.phar file with a parameter named "feature=shell" and passing the command using POST parameter named `cmd`.

This detailed breakdown confirms that the provided content is highly relevant to CVE-2018-6383 and contains valuable information for understanding the nature of the vulnerability and its exploitation.
