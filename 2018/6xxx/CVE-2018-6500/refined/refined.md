The provided content is a security bulletin for Micro Focus ArcSight Management Center, and it is related to the specified CVE.

**Root cause of vulnerability**: The root cause is not specifically detailed, but the bulletin mentions "Insufficient Access Control." This likely refers to improper authorization checks allowing unauthorized access to functions or data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
*   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
*   Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   Arbitrary File Download
*   Information Disclosure
*   Access Restriction Bypass
*   Directory Traversal

**Impact of exploitation**:
*   CSRF: An attacker could potentially perform actions on the application on behalf of a legitimate user without their consent.
*   XSS: An attacker could inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to session hijacking or other malicious activities.
*   Arbitrary File Download: An attacker could download sensitive files from the server.
*   Information Disclosure: An attacker could gain access to sensitive information.
*   Access Restriction Bypass: An attacker could access restricted features or functionalities.
*   Directory Traversal: An attacker could access files and directories outside of the intended web root.

**Attack vectors**: These vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely. The specific methods of exploitation are not detailed but would involve crafting malicious requests or payloads to exploit the weaknesses listed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the affected ArcSight Management Center. They do not require prior authentication for some of the vulnerabilities (e.g., Unauthenticated File Download).
