  "CVE-2018-6927": {
    "description": "The futex_requeue function in kernel/futex.c in the Linux kernel before 4.14.15, might allow attackers to cause a denial of service (integer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impacts by triggering a negative wake or requeue value. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although we believe it is unlikely.",
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the futex_requeue function due to lack of validation for negative wake or requeue values.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Lack of Input Validation"

    "impact": "Denial of service (system crash), or possibly other unspecified impacts. Privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out.",
