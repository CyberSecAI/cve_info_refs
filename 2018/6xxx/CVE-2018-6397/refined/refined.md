Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The Joomla! Component Picture Calendar for Joomla 3.1.4 is vulnerable to a directory traversal issue.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The `list.php` script in the component doesn't properly sanitize the `folder` parameter. This allows an attacker to traverse the file system on the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary file access:** An attacker can access files and directories on the server that should not be publicly accessible. This could potentially lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, including configuration files, source code, or user data.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `list.php` script, including the malicious `folder` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target Joomla! instance.
*   **Basic understanding of web requests:** The attacker needs to craft the URL with the malicious `folder` parameter.

**Technical Details**

*   The vulnerable parameter is `folder`.
*   The vulnerable script is `list.php`.
*   The exploit URL format is `http://localhost/[PATH]/list.php?folder=[DIRECTORY]`.
