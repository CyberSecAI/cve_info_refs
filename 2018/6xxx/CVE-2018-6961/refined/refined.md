Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-6961:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a command injection flaw in the local web UI component of VMware SD-WAN Edge by VeloCloud.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unauthenticated Command Injection: The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication. This means an attacker does not need valid credentials to execute commands.
- The local web UI component is vulnerable. While it's disabled by default, enabling it exposes the device to the vulnerability, especially on untrusted networks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected device. This can lead to a complete compromise of the system, including data theft, malware installation, and denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable through HTTP requests to the vulnerable web UI component.
- Specifically, the `/scripts/ajaxPortal.lua` endpoint is vulnerable as it takes user-controlled data and executes it in a command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: An attacker needs network access to the SD-WAN Edge device. This could be from a local network if the web UI is exposed internally or from a remote network if the device is accessible through the internet.
- No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in SD-WAN Edge versions 3.x and 2.x running on Linux.
- The vulnerability is triggered by injecting code into the `destination` or `name` parameters of the POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.
- The exploit script available at exploit-db uses parameters like `source`, `lhost`, `lport`, `func`, to craft specific requests.
- The script exploits the `traceroute`, `ping`, or `dns` functions within the web UI by injecting arbitrary commands within those functions' arguments.
- The provided exploit sends the output of executed commands (e.g., `/etc/shadow`) to a netcat listener controlled by the attacker.

**Resolution:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in VMware SD-WAN Edge by VeloCloud build R312-20180716-GA.
- VMware recommends reviewing the patch/release notes and verifying checksums when downloading updates.
- A workaround was provided by disabling the local web UI component, but the long-term fix was to patch to the latest version.
