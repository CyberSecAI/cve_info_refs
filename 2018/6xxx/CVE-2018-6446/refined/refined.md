- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The presence of an undocumented user credential with an encrypted default password providing access to the JBoss Web Console Management interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Hard-coded credentials and access to the JBoss web console management interface.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated, remote attacker could log in to the JBoss Administration interface and install additional JEE applications, potentially gaining full control of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote access to Network Advisor client libraries, followed by decryption of the Jboss credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs access to Network Advisor client libraries and the ability to decrypt the JBoss credentials. The attacker also needs network access to the JBoss web console.
