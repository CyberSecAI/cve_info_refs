Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6360:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of protocol validation in the `ytdl_hook.lua` script of the mpv media player. This script uses `youtube-dl` to extract video URLs from web pages. `youtube-dl` doesn't validate the extracted URLs, and neither did the `ytdl_hook.lua` script before the fix. This allowed an attacker to inject arbitrary URLs that could be used by mpv, bypassing the usual safe-protocol checks within the `stream.c` code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of URL validation in `ytdl_hook.lua`.
- `youtube-dl` returns URLs without sanitization.
- mpv did not check protocols for URLs coming from the `ytdl_hook.lua` script.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the host system of the mpv user. This is achieved by crafting a malicious web page that contains a `<video>` tag with a `src` attribute pointing to a malicious URL such as `av://lavfi:ladspa=file=/path/to/malicious.so`. This is possible due to the way ffmpeg handles such URLs, allowing to load arbitrary shared libraries using `dlopen()`.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker crafts a malicious HTML page with a `<video>` tag pointing to a malicious URL in the `src` attribute, or by injecting malicious URLs via youtube-dl extractors
- The victim is tricked into opening this page using mpv.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage or control a source that youtube-dl will process.
- The attacker needs to convince the victim to open the malicious URL with mpv.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability exists because the `ytdl_hook.lua` script does not validate the protocols of the URLs extracted by `youtube-dl` before passing them to mpv.
- The vulnerability is fixed by introducing a whitelist of safe protocols in the `ytdl_hook.lua` script.
- The fix involves checking the extracted URLs against a list of allowed protocols such as "http", "https", "ftp", "ftps", "rtmp", "rtmps", "rtmpe", "rtmpt", "rtmpts", "rtmpte", and "data". Any URLs with protocols not in this list are ignored.
- The vulnerability can be exploited by using the `av://` protocol with the `lavfi` ladspa plugin to load arbitrary files from the filesystem as shared libraries.
- This vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
