- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient validation in the ELF header parser. Malformed or invalid ELF binaries were not rejected.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The kernel's ELF header parser lacks proper validation, allowing it to process malformed or invalid ELF binaries.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Execution of a malicious ELF binary may result in a kernel crash or may disclose kernel memory.
- **Attack vectors**: Executing a crafted, malicious ELF binary.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Ability to execute a malicious ELF binary on the vulnerable system.
