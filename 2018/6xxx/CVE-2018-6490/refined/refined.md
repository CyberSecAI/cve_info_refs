Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6490:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The default configuration of Micro Focus Operations Orchestration exposes the JMiniX JMX console to unauthenticated remote users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The JMX console is accessible without any authentication, allowing anyone with network access to interact with it.
- **Information Disclosure:**  Attackers can use the JMX console to retrieve sensitive system information, including system properties, potentially exposing paths, usernames, and other configurations.
- **Remote Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can leverage the JMX console to execute commands that can disrupt the service by stopping the web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive system information can be exposed, which can be used for further attacks or reconnaissance.
- **Denial of Service:** The Operations Orchestration web interface can be shut down, leading to a denial of service and impacting business operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
- **HTTP Requests:** Attackers can interact with the JMX console via HTTP POST requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable system.
- **No Authentication Required:** No credentials or prior authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of JMX Console:** Basic understanding of how to interact with the JMX console is required to exploit specific functions like system property retrieval or service shutdown.

**Additional Notes:**
- The Tenable advisory notes that Micro Focus scored this vulnerability with "Access Complexity: High" (AC:H). Tenable disagrees, stating the default configuration and ease of exploitation warrants an "Access Complexity: Low" (AC:L) and adjusts their CVSS score accordingly.
- The vulnerability was initially reported to HPE (before Micro Focus acquired the product).
- The provided information includes examples of how to exploit this vulnerability, such as retrieving system properties and stopping the web interface using `curl` commands.
