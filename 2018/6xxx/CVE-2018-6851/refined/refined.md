Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-6851:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `lcencvm.sys` module of Sophos SafeGuard products.
*   Specifically, a crafted input buffer to the driver via IOCTL `0x80206040` allows control of the execution path to write a constant DWORD `0` to an arbitrary memory address.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Arbitrary Memory Write:** The driver allows a user-controlled address to be overwritten with a constant `0` value. This is a fundamental memory corruption vulnerability.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The driver doesn't properly validate the input buffer, allowing an attacker to control the write destination address.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** The arbitrary memory write can be leveraged to gain SYSTEM privileges. By overwriting specific memory locations related to the security tokens of a user process, an attacker can elevate their privileges to the SYSTEM level. The article notes that the same method as used previously can be used to exploit this issue.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** With SYSTEM privileges, an attacker can execute arbitrary code, allowing full control over the compromised system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access Required:** The attacker needs local access to the machine where the vulnerable Sophos software is installed.
*   **Crafted Input Buffer to Device Driver:** The exploit involves sending a specially crafted input buffer to the vulnerable `lcencvm.sys` device driver using the specified IOCTL code `0x80206040`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have the ability to interact with the device driver on the local machine.
*   They need to be able to send IOCTL requests with crafted input buffers.
*   Some understanding of Windows kernel exploitation techniques is required to leverage the arbitrary memory write and escalate privileges successfully.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided content gives significantly more detail than the description placeholder in the original CVE.
*   It indicates that the vulnerability can be exploited in a similar manner to the other vulnerabilities described, specifically by modifying the `SEP_TOKEN_PRIVILEGES` structure or zeroing out the security descriptor.
*   The blog post also describes the process of disclosure with a timeline.
