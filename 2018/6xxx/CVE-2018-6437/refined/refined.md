- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A vulnerability exists in the Brocade Fabric OS command line interface (CLI). Specifically, the `help` command can be exploited.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `help` command within the restricted CLI shell allows a local attacker to escape the shell.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to gain root access to the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local access to the Brocade Fabric OS CLI, specifically by using the `help` command.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access to the Brocade Fabric OS CLI.
