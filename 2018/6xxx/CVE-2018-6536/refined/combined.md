## Description

[![@orlitzky](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1432135?v=4&size=48)](/orlitzky)[orlitzky](https://github.com/orlitzky)opened [on Jan 16, 2018](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/issues/5991#issue-289017877)

The icinga2 daemon creates its PID file after dropping privileges to the `ICINGA2_USER`. That may be exploited through the init script (or other management tools) by the `ICINGA2_USER` to kill root processes, since when the daemon is stopped, root sends a "kill" signal to the contents of the PID file (which are under the control of the runtime user).

For example,

```
 $ sudo ls -l /run/icinga2/
total 4
drwxr-s--- 2 icinga icingacmd 40 Jan 16 13:16 cmd
-rw-r--r-- 1 icinga icingacmd  5 Jan 16 13:43 icinga2.pid

```

However, the init script (`icinga2.init.d.cmake`) is executed as root, and does,

```
stop() {
    ...
    pid=`cat $ICINGA2_PID_FILE` # untrustworthy!
    ...
    kill -KILL $pid
```

If the daemon is in any way compromised, the `ICINGA2_USER` can write a PID of his choice into his own PID file. The next time the icinga2 service is stopped, his desired PID will be killed. That can be abused to kill off sshd, to reboot the machine, etc.

The "easy" way to work around this problem is to create the PID file as root, before dropping privileges. That comes with its own set of problems, in particular that you won't be able to modify or delete the PID file in the forked (non-root) process. It does however allow a very dumb, portable, init script to handle the PID file safely.
