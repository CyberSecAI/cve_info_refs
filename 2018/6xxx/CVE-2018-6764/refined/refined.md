Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2018-6764:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability arises from how `libvirt_lxc` handles hostname resolution within LXC containers. Specifically, `libvirt_lxc` resolves the hostname *after* the guest filesystem is mounted, but *before* the initialization of the guest system. This sequence of operations causes the system to load `libnss_dns.so` (a library used for DNS lookups) from the guest's filesystem rather than the host's.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Library Loading:** The primary weakness is that `libvirt_lxc` loads a critical library (`libnss_dns.so`) from the untrusted guest filesystem *before* the container is properly secured or file handles are closed. This exposes a window of opportunity for a malicious guest to inject code.
*   **Timing Issue:** The vulnerability relies on the specific timing between mounting the guest's file system and the execution of `init` within the guest, which creates a race condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker controlling the guest system can replace the host's `libnss_dns.so` with a malicious version. When the host loads the library (as part of host name resolution within the LXC container setup), it executes this malicious code, resulting in arbitrary code execution on the host system.
*   **Container Escape:** Successful exploitation allows a malicious guest to escape the confinement of its container environment, potentially gaining access to resources and data outside the container.
*   **Host System Compromise:** In severe cases, this could lead to a complete compromise of the virtualization host.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Guest:** A compromised or malicious guest LXC container that can modify its file system.
*   **Library Replacement:** The attacker needs to replace the legitimate `libnss_dns.so` with a malicious version in the guest's filesystem.
*   **Hostname Resolution:** The attacker relies on `libvirt_lxc` to perform a hostname resolution after mounting the guest filesystem but before securing the container and executing `init`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Control over a Guest LXC Container:** The attacker must have control over the contents of an LXC container's filesystem.
*   **Privileged Access within the Guest:** The attacker typically needs root or administrative privileges within the guest container to modify the system library.
*   **Timing:** The attacker depends on the specific sequence of operations by `libvirt_lxc` during container startup for the exploit to function.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects `libvirt_lxc`, a specific driver within the libvirt virtualization library used for managing LXC containers.
*   The issue was addressed by ensuring hostname resolution happens on startup, before the guest filesystem is mounted.
*   The vulnerability primarily affects systems running libvirt versions prior to the fix.
*   Upstream fix for this issue is in git commit `759b4d1b0fe5f4d84d98b99153dfa7ac289dd167`.
*   Red Hat Product Security has rated the issue as Moderate.

**Affected Systems (as per the provided content):**

*   Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, 17.10
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.
*   Debian Stretch.
