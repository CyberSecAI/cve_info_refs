Package        : ming
Version        : 0.4.4-1.1+deb7u7
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-5251 CVE-2018-5294 CVE-2018-6315 CVE-2018-6359

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Ming:

CVE-2018-5251

    Integer signedness error vulnerability (left shift of a negative value) in
    the readSBits function (util/read.c). Remote attackers can leverage this
    vulnerability to cause a denial of service via a crafted swf file.

CVE-2018-5294

    Integer overflow vulnerability (caused by an out-of-range left shift) in
    the readUInt32 function (util/read.c). Remote attackers could leverage this
    vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service via a crafted swf file.

CVE-2018-6315

    Integer overflow and resultant out-of-bounds read in the
    outputSWF_TEXT_RECORD function (util/outputscript.c). Remote attackers
    could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial of service or
    unspecified other impact via a crafted SWF file.

CVE-2018-6359

    Use-after-free vulnerability in the decompileIF function
    (util/decompile.c). Remote attackers could leverage this vulnerability to
    cause a denial of service or unspecified other impact via a crafted SWF
    file.

For Debian 7 "Wheezy", these problems have been fixed in version
0.4.4-1.1+deb7u7.

We recommend that you upgrade your ming packages.

Most of the time, this actually ends up being a good thing.  I've tweaked the cups ebuild (1.1.13-r2, now on cvs) so this problem should now be fixed. ``` |  |
