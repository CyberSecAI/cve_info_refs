##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

#### [Superb support!](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/calendars-a-events/events/jticketing/#rev-125838)

[Rika (2).](/profile/profile/details/532106)

Posted on 08 August 2024

###### Functionality

Satisfied with functionality. Especially love the multi-vendor function, simple end-user interface, customizable multi-language message.

###### Ease of use

Simple and easy enough once you get used to it. Most of the functions are self-explanatory.

###### Support

Very responsive support. Quick reply and great support. They always listen to feature requests and willing to implement them when necessary.

###### Documentation

Simple but probably enough for getting started. Documentation for various kind of integration is also available.

###### Value for money

Great value for money, considering their reliable support and continuous improvement.

I used this to:
Online ticket booking platform for multi-vendors where each vendor create events and tickets.

#### [Best Functionality, Best Support](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/calendars-a-events/events/jticketing/#rev-118277)

[Richard (3).](/profile/profile/details/492546)

Posted on 16 October 2020

###### Functionality

I have tried all of the events software at one time or another and for events/ticketing JTicketing functionality is by far the best.

###### Ease of use

There is a slight learning curve here but there is nothing really hard to learn. The user interface is simple and logical.

###### Support

I needed to have Jitsi Meet and Zoom for my online Venue choices and when I contacted Techjoomla they added them in the following release.

###### Documentation

I think the documentation is a little light on the new venue additions but I am sure they will come up to speed on this very soon.

###### Value for money

Techjoomla could easily ask three times as much for this component. Real value for this component.

I used this to:
I run a faith based website and we use this for both virtual and physical venues.

#### [My go to solution!](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/calendars-a-events/events/jticketing/#rev-118041)

[Stephen Monaghan (1).](/profile/profile/details/536346)

Posted on 07 September 2020

###### Functionality

Jticketing has been a lifesaver for me. The out of the box functionality was an eye opener and helped me realise how to move forward.

###### Ease of use

After a pretty short learning curve I found it easy to get me head into it. Any questions I had were swiftly answered by their solid support

###### Support

I am very impressed by their support. I ended up asking for many customisations that went very very well. 10 out of 10 to their support.

###### Documentation

Very good for getting started. I used this a lot while learning the system. All functions are well documented and easy to find.

###### Value for money

Absolutely! I have had outstanding support and customisations added without extra costs. I happily paid for 1 major customisation on top.

I used this to:
A ticket purchase system for my event company. Together with the Membership Pro component to control guest/member ticket variations. Works!

#### [Too many bugs](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/calendars-a-events/events/jticketing/#rev-117673)

[Whats On (4).](/profile/profile/details/337951)

Posted on 14 July 2020

###### Functionality

Promised much but failed to deliver. Continually needed support After 3 months removed it and used Event Booking by Joomdonation instead.

###### Ease of use

Fairly straightforward and easy enough to navigate if only it worked the way it was supposed to

###### Support

Fairly responsive, made many changes on my version, promising stuff to be included in next update which never came. Caused other issues

###### Documentation

Easy enough to follow but out of date in places AND the instructions worked. Spent a lot of time ploughing through it all

###### Value for money

Not really as I tried to iron out all the probs and was too late to request a refund. Many hours cost trying to fix issues caused as well.

I used this to:
An events management website that required its own ticketing system and was also looking to build local ticketing platform
Owner's reply:
Hello, could you elaborate on the features that you were expecting to see in the next update?

#### [Great Extension & Fantastic Support](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/calendars-a-events/events/jticketing/#rev-116270)

[Scott Morgan (4).](/profile/profile/details/214009)

Posted on 06 March 2020

###### Functionality

Very functional and versatile with many features for different event types, good payment plugins and customisations

###### Ease of use

Once you know your way around it is very user friendly with WYSIWYG admin and easy to use features

###### Support

Support is fantastic, above and beyond, friendly and helpful support team

###### Documentation

It's all there, plus the support is great, all questions answered

###### Value for money

Good value for money for what the extension does, and the subscription price is reasonable in relation to level of support

I used this to:
1 client at the moment for an annual festival selling various types of tickets

#### [Reporting of Results Failure](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/calendars-a-events/events/jticketing/#rev-108469)

[Clint Davis (1).](/profile/profile/details/454476)

Posted on 14 February 2018

###### Functionality

It only works if you have the same kind of ticket for your event.

###### Ease of use

Not that easy. Many of my site users have difficulty with the GUI.

###### Support

Support has become so slow. Basically the only answer they can give is we cannot do that. Bad/slow support is what drives me away from this

###### Documentation

Documentation is basic and doesn't help answer questions. You'll need an in depth knowledge of CSS to make this work with your site.

###### Value for money

They could make it better and charge more money but wont. The reporting after ticket sales are done is awful.

I used this to:
managing an annual event via jomsocial. I have several ticket types, gen admin, sponsors, vip, etc. There is no way to see what kinds of tickets are sold only a dollar amount. I have used this extension for a few years but this will be the last.

#### [Great extension!! It has saved me thousands of dollars.](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/calendars-a-events/events/jticketing/#rev-106009)

[Mike Billings (1).](/profile/profile/details/428491)

Posted on 22 August 2017

###### Functionality

it does what it says it will do.

###### Ease of use

easy to install and use

###### Support

###### Documentation

###### Value for money

good value

I used this to:
I use this to sell tickets to a festival at our farm. we sell about 5,000 online tickets a year using it. The support is very good (once you figure out how to account for the time difference between them and you) and the extension is easy to use.

#### [Good job](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/calendars-a-events/events/jticketing/#rev-105894)

[Annie (2).](/profile/profile/details/427658)

Posted on 16 August 2017

###### Functionality

An interesting extension, it is all I need

###### Ease of use

Easy to install and use

###### Support

Don't need it

###### Documentation

Don't need it

###### Value for money

It's quite expensive, but I think with its value, it's ok

#### [Very nice feature to add to Jomsocial](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/calendars-a-events/events/jticketing/#rev-105317)

[Paul (2).](/profile/profile/details/195871)

Posted on 30 June 2017

###### Functionality

Does what it should do nicely

###### Ease of use

Very simple to install

###### Support

Takes a day or so to answer but always follows up and provide good solutions even to non standard issues.

They know what they are doing

###### Documentation

Didn't need it

###### Value for money

Excellent value for money

I used this to:
Providing tickets to a cycling event

#### [Good but too much bugs](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/calendars-a-events/events/jticketing/#rev-104443)

[Witty (5).](/profile/profile/details/168460)

Posted on 28 April 2017

###### Functionality

Not so good

###### Ease of use

Not too bad

###### Support

Takes sometimes 5 days to get a response.

###### Documentation

###### Value for money

Their way to solve issues: "Yes we can solve it, but you will have to pay for the solution"
