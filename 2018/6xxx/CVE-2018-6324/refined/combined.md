Feb 15, 2018
• Oscar Hjelm

CVE-2018-6324

https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2018-6324

# Summary

The application will upon successfully logging in redirect the user to a user-controlled destination. A victim user may
not recognise that a redirection takes place as they expect to be sent to a new page.

# Vendor Description

F-Secure Radar is a turnkey vulnerability scanning and management platform. It allows you to identify and manage both
internal and external threats, report risks, and be compliant with current and future regulations (such as PCI and GDPR
compliance). It gives you visibility into shadow IT - to map your full attack surface and respond to critical
vulnerabilities associated with cyber threats.

# Remediation

F-Secure has remediated this issue; no action required for cloud users or on-premise users receiving updates.

# Technical Details

Navigating to the Radar application at https://portal.radar.f-secure.com/ will result in the user being sent to
https://portal.radar.f-secure.com/login?ReturnUrl=~2Fdashboard.

Upon successful authentication, the value of the ReturnURL query parameter will be used to determine the redirect
destination. It is possible to set this to any arbitrary domain as the value is neither validated nor forced to be a
relative path.

The following URL would redirect the user to example.com after logging in:
https://portal.radar.f-secure.com/login?ReturnUrl=~2F~2Fexample.com

This could be used to send the user to a phishing site, prompting them to re-authenticate (e.g. “Wrong password or
username, please try again”).
