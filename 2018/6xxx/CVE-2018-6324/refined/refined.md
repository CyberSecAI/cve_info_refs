- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application redirects users to a user-controlled destination after successful login, using the `ReturnUrl` query parameter without proper validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unvalidated redirect, where the `ReturnUrl` parameter can be set to an arbitrary domain.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can redirect a user to a malicious site, such as a phishing page, after they log in to the legitimate application.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the `ReturnUrl` parameter set to a malicious domain, then tricks the user into clicking it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into clicking a malicious link to the legitimate login page with a crafted `ReturnUrl` parameter.
