The provided content is related to CVE-2018-6651.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the insufficient validation of the `Origin` header during the establishment of a WebSocket connection between the Parsec client's web frontend and the native client. The `uncurl_ws_accept` function uses `strstr` to check if the `Origin` header contains one of the allowed origins, which allows for origins like `https://parsecgaming.com.example.com` to pass validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insufficient origin validation:** The use of `strstr` for origin validation is too permissive, allowing for subdomains of the legitimate domain to be used.
- **Lack of strict origin matching:**  The code does not require an exact match with the allowed origin, making it vulnerable to spoofing.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Full control over the Parsec client:** An attacker can send arbitrary commands to the client, enabling full control over the victim's computer.
- **Privilege escalation within Parsec:** Attackers can grant their own accounts additional permissions within the Parsec application, even if the attacker's account had limited privileges before.
- **Denial of service:** Attackers can disconnect legitimate users remotely connected to the compromised machine.
- **Information disclosure:** Attackers can retrieve information from a compromised host via the Parsec API.
- **Remote connection enablement:** Attackers can enable remote connections on devices that were configured not to host connections.
- **Potential credential theft:** Attackers might retrieve stored Parsec credentials.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Specially crafted domain name:** The victim must visit a website with a specially crafted domain name controlled by the attacker.
- **JavaScript and WebSocket support:** The victim's web browser must support JavaScript and be able to establish WebSocket connections.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Control of a website:** The attacker needs to control a website that can be visited by the victim.
- **Ability to establish WebSocket connection:** The attacker must be able to make a websocket request to the Parsec client on the victims machine using a malicious origin.
- **Understanding of the Parsec API:**  The attacker needs to know the commands that can be sent to the Parsec client's API.
