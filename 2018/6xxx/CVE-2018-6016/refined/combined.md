]==============================================================

* System affected : 10-Strike Network Monitor [1]
* Software Version : 5.4. Other versions or models may also be affected.
* Impact : Allow an authorized but non-privileged local user to execute
arbitrary code with elevated privileges on the system. If an attacker
could copy a malicious file and place it on, for example, into the root
directory. This would cause windows to run the malicious executable in
the user context of the service account at the next service start.

## MAGAZINE REVIEWS

![](/img/PC-magazine-2015-logo.png)

**"Network Monitor"**

*PC Magazine/RE's annual software review "Best Soft 2015"*

"This pro­gram al­lows you to mon­it­or the IT in­fra­struc­ture start­ing from switches and serv­ers, and end­ing with UPS and door sensors in racks with equip­ment polled via the SN­MP pro­tocol. It is al­lowed to con­trol not only the device op­er­ab­il­ity, but to check wheth­er some device's para­met­ers are bey­ond crit­ic­al thresholds. For ex­ample, this can be the CPU tem­per­at­ure, voltage, toner level in a print­er, sig­nal level in a fiber op­tic line, or amount of free space on disks. There are sev­er­al meth­ods of no­ti­fic­a­tions avail­able for an ad­min­is­trat­or. Charts dis­play­ing para­met­ers help pre­dict­ing trends be­fore a real fail­ure oc­curs"

![](/img/PC-magazine-2014-logo.png)

**"Network Inventory Explorer"**

*Award Winner "RU Software 2014: innovations and achievements" by PC Magazine/RE.*

"PCs are polled in the back­ground mode provid­ing the ad­min­is­trat­or with up-to-date re­ports on com­pon­ents and pro­grams in­stalled on com­puters. The pack­age al­lows you to col­lect the in­form­a­tion from PC be­hind routers and NAT ex­tract­ing data from laptops and An­droid gad­gets of mo­bile em­ploy­ees."

![](/img/cnews-logo.png)

**"Network Inventory Explorer"**

"This is a power­ful tool for cent­ral­ized in­vent­ory of hard­ware and soft­ware of com­puters on a LAN. It al­lows you to dis­cov­er com­puters on the net­work and col­lect the in­form­a­tion about them in a data­base... The abil­ity to se­lect com­puters in the re­port whose con­fig­ur­a­tions sat­is­fy a giv­en con­di­tion sim­pli­fies tasks such as plan­ning up­grades."

![](/img/PC-magazine-2013-logo.png)

**"Network Inventory Explorer"**

*Award Winner "Best Software 2013" by PC Magazine/RE*

"The con­veni­ent sys­tem of the IT in­fra­struc­ture in­vent­ory is es­pe­cially use­ful in SMB com­pan­ies with their "zoo" of equip­ment. The sys­tem re­cords hard­ware brands, PC con­fig­ur­a­tion, soft­ware ver­sions and li­censes. One of the most use­ful fea­tures is track­ing changes in equip­ment, which makes it pos­sible to de­tect fail­ure, loss or re­place­ment of com­pon­ents."

![](/img/network-computing-awards-2014.png)

**"LANState"**

 *Network Computing Awards 2014*
"LAN­State Pro 7 is a fi­nal­ist for the 2014 Net­work Com­put­ing Awards. The pro­gram was nom­in­ated for the "New Product of the Year" Award cat­egory by the "Net­work Com­put­ing" magazine (UK)."

![](/img/PC-magazine-2005-logo.png)

**"LANState"**

*PC Magazine/RE's annual software review "Best Software 2005"*

"It is not so mighty and "heavy" as HP Open­View, but it is quite func­tion­al and easy to use. The soft­ware provides auto­mat­ic form­ing of a net­work map, and al­lows or­gan­iz­ing serv­er and work­sta­tion mon­it­or­ing, provides ba­sic re­mote man­age­ment fa­cil­it­ies..."

![](/img/PC-magazine-2010-logo.png)

**"Network Diagram"**

10-Strike Net­work Dia­gram was awar­ded by PC Magazine/RE in the "Best­Soft 2010" con­test!

![](/img/network-computing-awards-2015.png)

**"Bandwidth Monitor"**

10-Strike Band­width Mon­it­or 3.0 is a fi­nal­ist for the 2015 Net­work Com­put­ing Awards. The pro­gram was nom­in­ated for the "IT Op­tim­isa­tion Product of The Year" Award cat­egory by "Net­work Com­put­ing UK" - a pop­u­lar net­work­ing magazine in the Great Brit­an.

## SUCCESS STORIES

![](/img/lanstate-logo.png)

**"LANState"**

*Joe B:*

"I have been us­ing LAN­State for a month now, and it has al­lowed me to fix the net­work is­sues be­fore users real­ize something happened. It keeps my VPN con­nec­tions up and al­lows me to mon­it­or and ac­cess the print­er serv­er's and work­sta­tion re­sources all from one place.
I have 109 net­work en­tit­ies lis­ted so far and will be adding an­oth­er 35 later this month. Your soft­ware has saved me hours of work be­ing able to work from my desk in­stead of go­ing to dif­fer­ent build­ings and of­fices to ac­cess the re­sources. The abil­ity to keep my VPN con­nec­tions alive 24/7 is a bless­ing in it­self. I highly re­com­mend the soft­ware."

![](/img/netmon-logo.png)

**"Network Monitor"**

*Cristian Locicero, C.L. INFORMATICA, Italy:*

"Con­grat­u­la­tions on the speed with which you have up­dated the "Net­work Mon­it­or Pro" pro­gram. I have been try­ing NM Pro for a few days and I think it is an ex­cel­lent product that is simple, very func­tion­al and scal­able, the type of NMS that I could of­fer to my cus­tom­ers (PMI)."

![](/img/netmon-logo.png)

**"Network Monitor"**

*Ivan Simkin, MTS, Russia:*

"10-Strike Net­work Mon­it­or has been re­peatedly noted for good func­tion­al­ity from the top man­age­ment of our com­pany. The last hap­pi­ness / mis­for­tune was a big ac­ci­dent on our net­work, no­ti­fic­a­tions of which reached the man­age­ment via SMS."

![](/img/lanstate-logo.png)

**"LANState"**

*Scott M.:*

"I was very im­pressed with the amount of con­trol that the soft­ware could give you over a net­work that I am man­aging. I was test­ing a num­ber of oth­er map­ping soft­ware at the time but none could do what LAN­State pro could do."

![](/img/lanstate-logo.png)

**"LANState"**

*Andrew H:*

"I also wanted to tell you how much I like the abil­ity of im­port­ing pre­vi­ous scans in­to a cur­rent scan. This pro­gram has been the most valu­able net­work tool I have used yet."

![](/img/lanstate-logo.png)

**"LANState"**

*Renato M:*

"Many thanks for your ex­cel­lent sup­port. Ac­tu­ally it works very fine and it even finds the un­man­aged switches (hub) in between; it is a won­der­ful tool."

![](/img/lanstate-logo.png)

**"LANState"**

*Arthur B:*

"After con­duct­ing an ex­tens­ive search for soft­ware that would auto­mat­ic­ally de­tect net­work devices, and then pro­duce a net­work dia­gram to graph­ic­ally rep­res­ent the net­work lay­out, we found LAN­State Pro. This soft­ware saves time and money pro­du­cing pro­fes­sion­al net­work schem­at­ics with ease. LAN­State Pro provides not only a snap­shot of the net­work but also the de­tails such as IP, MAC, and status in­form­a­tion at the touch of a but­ton. From a se­cur­ity point of view it also al­lows the cli­ent to see who is con­nec­ted to the net­work to as­sist in pre­vent­ing un­au­thor­ized ac­cess. Simply a great product. Thanks."

![](/img/lanstate-logo.png)

**"LANState"**

*Ivan S:*

"Thank you very much. Your LAN­State is the best pro­gram!
Now, I know ex­actly what hap­pens on my net­work at every mo­ment. It is very simple to man­age all com­puters us­ing your pro­gram. LAN­State com­bines a friendly in­ter­face and many ne­ces­sary fea­tures for the net­work ad­min­is­tra­tion and man­age­ment"
