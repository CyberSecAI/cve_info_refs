      "content": "The ElGamal implementation in libgcrypt is not secure for general purposes. If libgcrypt is used to encrypt messages directly, rather than using for hybrid encryption, the security can be broken. This is a ciphertext-only attack. It is recommended that libgcrypt should announce that ElGamal in libgcrypt should only be used for hybrid encryption or implement ElGamal with semantic security. One problem is about current ElGamal's prime generation which is hard to make fast and secure.",
