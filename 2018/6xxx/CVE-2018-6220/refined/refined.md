Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6220:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an insecure update mechanism in Trend Micro Email Encryption Gateway 5.5. Specifically, the `rpmFileName` variable, which dictates the path where the update file is downloaded, is directly controlled by an attacker via a crafted update file response. This enables an attacker to specify an arbitrary file path on the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Write:** The application downloads an update file to a path controlled by the attacker.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not validate or sanitize the `rpmFileName` before using it in the file download path.
*   **Insecure Update Mechanism:**  The update process lacks certificate validation or public key pinning.
*   **Cleartext Communication:** The update process uses unencrypted HTTP.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Write as Root:** An attacker can write arbitrary files to the file system with root privileges, because the application downloads the update file as root user with 0644 permissions.
*   **Remote Code Execution as Root:** By writing a malicious cron job or other executable files, the attacker can gain remote code execution with root privileges.
*    **Man-in-the-Middle Attack**: This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker positioned as a man-in-the-middle.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** An attacker intercepts the update request and injects a modified response that contains the attacker-controlled file name.
*   **HTTP Request Tampering:** The attacker manipulates the server's response to the update check to specify an arbitrary file name and path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle Position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and modify network traffic between the Trend Micro Email Encryption Gateway and the update server.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the target system and the update server, or have the ability to intercept the communications.
*   **Knowledge of the Update Mechanism:** The attacker needs knowledge of how the update mechanism works to craft a malicious response.
* **Ability to craft a malicious HTTP response**: The attacker needs the ability to craft a specific HTTP response to the update check request.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content gives a very detailed explanation of the vulnerability, a proof of concept, and instructions for how an attacker could gain root command execution.
*   The content provides specific details on vulnerable code snippets within the application (`com/identum/pmg/web/CheckForUpdates.java`).
*   The exploit demonstrates how to create a cron job using the arbitrary file write vulnerability, which then executes a reverse shell, establishing root access.
* The vulnerability is part of a series of vulnerabilities found in Trend Micro Email Encryption Gateway 5.5 (Build 1111.00)
