- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability occurs due to how a Spectrum network service handles invalid data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of invalid data by a Spectrum network service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can send a request that may disrupt a Spectrum service and potentially cause further product instability, resulting in a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can send a request containing invalid data to the vulnerable Spectrum network service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable Spectrum service. No authentication is required.
