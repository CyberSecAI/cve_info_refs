Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6307:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a heap use-after-free in the server code of the LibVNCServer's file transfer extension. Specifically, it occurs within the `HandleFileDownloadCancelRequest` function in `handlefiletransferrequest.c`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Use-After-Free:** The `rfbCloseClient` function, when called during a file download cancellation, frees the `rtcp` extension data. However, the code then proceeds to use `rtcp` as an argument to `CloseUndoneFileTransfer`, resulting in the use of already freed memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system. This is due to the ability to manipulate memory after it has been freed.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected systems running a LibVNCServer instance.
- **File Transfer Extension:** The tight file transfer extension must be enabled on the server to trigger the vulnerability.
- **File Download Cancel Request:** The attacker sends a specially crafted File Download Cancel Request, which triggers the vulnerable code path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must be able to establish a network connection to the vulnerable server.
- **User Privileges:**  Successful exploitation requires user privileges on the server.
- **Knowledge of VNC Protocol:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of the VNC protocol and how to craft specific messages to trigger the file transfer cancellation and use-after-free.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability exists in LibVNCServer versions prior to 0.9.12.
- The provided information includes a PoC demonstrating the vulnerability.
- The fix for this vulnerability involves updating to LibVNCServer 0.9.12 or a newer version.
- The issue was reported by Pavel Cheremushkin from Kaspersky Lab ICS CERT Vulnerability Research Group.
- The vulnerability is also present in `iTALC` which uses a patched version of LibVNCServer.
