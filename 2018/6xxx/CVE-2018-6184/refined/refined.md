Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2018-6184:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a directory traversal issue within the `/_next` request namespace of Next.js.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Directory Traversal: The application allows an attacker to craft a request to access files outside of the intended webroot.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: An attacker can potentially access sensitive information in the filesystem. This could include source code, configuration files, or other data that should not be publicly accessible. The impact is lessened in container-based deployments, `chroot` environments, or virtualized environments, with the majority of impact limited to frontend javascript.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted HTTP request: The attacker crafts a malicious request, specifically targeting the `/_next` namespace, to exploit the directory traversal vulnerability. The specific method is not detailed.
- The attacker uses `..` in the crafted request to traverse directories.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated, as this is a server-side vulnerability affecting the way Next.js handles requests to the `/_next` namespace.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected Next.js server.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Orange Tsai from DEVCORE.
- A similar path traversal vulnerability existed previously in the `/static` directory.
- The fix for this vulnerability includes precautions to prevent similar problems in the future.
- A common security test file, `security.js`, was created to avoid future regressions regarding path traversal.
- Deployments on `now.sh` (and presumably Vercel) were not affected because a platform-wide mitigation was implemented upon receiving the report. Static deployments via `next export` were also not affected.
- The content recommends that all users of Next.js prior to the patched version upgrade, regardless of whether they can reproduce the issue.
- Logs of affected sites can be filtered by the `..` sequence to identify potential exploitation.
- The fix was released in patch versions of stable and beta releases of Next.js.
