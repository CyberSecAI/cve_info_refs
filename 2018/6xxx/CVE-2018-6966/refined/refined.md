Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6966:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is located in the shader translator of VMware ESXi, Workstation, and Fusion. It is due to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The shader translator attempts to access memory outside of the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation may lead to the disclosure of sensitive information from the memory.
- **VM Crash:** Attackers with normal user privileges can potentially crash the virtual machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is within the shader translator component, suggesting the attack vector involves manipulating the shader processing within a virtualized environment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have the ability to influence the shader translator. This suggests they need to be able to execute code within a guest OS that utilizes the vulnerable component.
- Normal user privileges within a guest operating system may be sufficient to trigger the crash.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
- VMware ESXi 6.7
- VMware Workstation Pro/Player 14.x (fixed in 14.1.2)
