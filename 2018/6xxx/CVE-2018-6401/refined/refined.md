- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Meross MSS110 smart plug has an exposed telnet service with a hardcoded username ("admin") and a blank password, allowing for unauthorized access to the device's shell.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Hardcoded telnet credentials (username "admin", blank password)
    - Unauthenticated web interface exposed at `admin.htm`
    - Telnet service is crashing when scanned with nmap or nikto
    - The device stores wifi credentials (ESSID, WPA2 passphrase, BSSID) which can be accessed via the `Meross/wifi` tool from the shell.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Full control of the device
    - Ability to retrieve sensitive information such as Wi-Fi credentials.
    - Potential to manipulate device behavior
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Network-based attack using telnet
    - Network-based attack targeting the web interface
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Attacker must be on the same network as the device.

**Additional notes:**
- The telnet vulnerability was present in firmware version 1.1.18 and was disabled in 1.1.24. The `admin.htm` administrative interface remained exposed and unauthenticated in 1.1.24.
- The device's firmware was extracted from the manufacturer's APK.
- The vulnerability allowed access to a shell-like interface, which included commands such as get, set, del, and prof.
