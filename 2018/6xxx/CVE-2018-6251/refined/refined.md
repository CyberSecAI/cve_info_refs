Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-6251:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the NVIDIA D3D10 driver (nvwgf2umx.dll).
- It's caused by a malformed pixel shader that leads to the driver writing data beyond the allocated heap memory region.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
- The driver incorrectly calculates the destination address for memory writes within the `preBUG_BUG` function, using a controllable index and a fixed multiplier.
- The index value is incremented each time this function is called, and an attacker can control how often this function is called.
- This can lead to writing data outside the intended heap buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** The heap corruption can cause a crash of the application using the driver and the operating system or hypervisor leading to a denial of service.
- **Potential Code Execution:**  The vulnerability can potentially be exploited to achieve code execution due to memory corruption, though the report notes that whether the limited control allows for full code execution is uncertain.
- **VMware guest-to-host escape:** The vulnerability can be triggered in a VMware guest OS, which then affects the VMware host machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** A user on a local machine can trigger the vulnerability by supplying a crafted pixel shader file.
- **VMware Guest Attack:** A user within a VMware guest machine can trigger the vulnerability, which can impact the VMware host.
- **Theoretical Remote Attack:** It is theoretically possible to exploit the vulnerability through a website using WebGL, assuming the browser does not use ANGLE and passes the malformed shader to the vulnerable driver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to supply a specially crafted pixel shader file to the vulnerable NVIDIA driver. This could be in either text or binary format.
- On a local machine, this can be achieved through a regular application that uses the GPU for rendering.
- On a VMware guest, this can be achieved through a program that uses the GPU within the guest, which then impacts the host.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a specific sequence of operations within the `preBUG_BUG` function.
- The index is multiplied by 0xB0 and added to the heap memory region address to get a write destination.
- The crash reports show a heap error, with a heap-buffer-overrun, and an access violation.
- The affected driver version is NVIDIA nvwgf2umx.dll 22.21.13.8607 (x64) on Windows 10 x64.
- The vulnerability can affect the VMware host as well when exploited from a guest.
- The issue is fixed in NVIDIA driver versions 391.35 (GeForce), 391.33 and 386.28 (Quadro, NVS), and 391.29 and 386.28 (Tesla) for Windows.
- Patched versions for Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris are also mentioned.

This detailed breakdown provides a more comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability than the basic CVE description, which only mentions a vulnerability in the DirectX 10 Usermode driver, where a specially crafted pixel shader can cause writing to unallocated memory, leading to denial of service or potential code execution.
