Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-6942:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A NULL pointer dereference occurs in the `Ins_GETVARIATION` function within the `src/truetype/ttinterp.c` file of the FreeType library. This happens when the `coords` variable is NULL, and the code attempts to access its elements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The code attempts to access memory via a pointer (`coords`) that might be NULL, leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A specially crafted font file can trigger the NULL pointer dereference, causing the application using FreeType to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Font File:** An attacker needs to provide a malicious font file that, when processed by FreeType, will cause the `coords` variable to be NULL during the `Ins_GETVARIATION` execution, triggering the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide or make the vulnerable application process the malicious font file. This could be achieved through various attack vectors, such as embedding the font in a website, document, or other user-accessible content.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was reported by oss-fuzz
- The fix involves adding a check for the `coords` variable being NULL and, if so, setting the `args` array to zero.
- The fix was included in freetype version 2.10.1
