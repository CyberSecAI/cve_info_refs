Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-6182:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization on the server-side. The Mahara application relies on the TinyMCE editor to strip potentially harmful code (like `<script>` tags) from user input. However, this is not sufficient as an attacker can bypass TinyMCE by crafting custom POST requests with malicious payloads and send them directly to the server. The server-side code fails to properly sanitize this input, leading to the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS due to the lack of server-side input validation.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The system trusts TinyMCE's client-side sanitization and doesn't perform adequate sanitization on the server-side, specifically in PHP.
- **Bypassing Client-Side Controls:** Attackers can bypass client-side sanitization by crafting their own HTTP requests with malicious input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to the execution of arbitrary code in the victim's browser. This could allow the attacker to perform malicious actions like:
   - Stealing cookies
   - Hijacking user sessions
   - Redirecting users to malicious websites
   - Defacing the application
   - Performing other actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious POST Requests:** An attacker can send specifically crafted POST requests with malicious code injected into the "text" parameter of wall posts, annotations, or resume composite fields.
- **Bypassing TinyMCE:** The attacker directly interacts with the server by sending malicious POST data rather than through the TinyMCE editor.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the Mahara server.
- **Knowledge of POST Data Structure:** The attacker needs some knowledge of the expected data structure for the wallpost, annotation or resume composite fields API to craft the malicious requests.
