Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2018-6835:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how the application handled JSONP responses. Specifically, it was not properly sanitizing the `response` data before embedding it into the JSONP callback.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Improper Sanitization**: The code directly inserts the API response into the JSONP callback without sanitizing it.
- **JSONP Injection**: By controlling the response, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the JSONP callback.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, leading to a full XSS vulnerability. This could be used for cookie theft, session hijacking, data exfiltration, and other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- **JSONP Parameter Manipulation:** An attacker would need to manipulate the `jsonp` query parameter in an API request to inject malicious JavaScript code into the JSONP response.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious JSONP request to the affected API endpoint.
- No special privileges or internal network access is needed. The attack can be launched from the browser.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability was addressed by:

1.  **Adding `isVarName(response)` Check:** The code was modified to check if the `response` was a valid variable name before wrapping it into a JSONP callback. This prevents arbitrary code from being injected through the response data.
    ```diff
    - if(req.query.jsonp)
    + if(req.query.jsonp && isVarName(response))
    ```
2.  **Adding `is-var-name` dependency:** The `is-var-name` package was added to the `package.json` file.
   ```diff
   "supertest" : "1.2.0"
   + "is-var-name" : "1.0.0"
   ```
This fix ensures that the application only uses valid variable names when generating the JSONP callback, thus preventing the XSS vulnerability by preventing an attacker from injecting javascript through the API response.

This information aligns with the common understanding of JSONP vulnerabilities and how they are exploited via XSS.
