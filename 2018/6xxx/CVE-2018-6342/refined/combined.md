Use a whitelist to validate user-provided file names. This doesn't cover the entire range of valid filenames but should cover almost all of them in practice. Allows letters, numbers, periods, dashes, and underscores. Opting to use a whitelist instead of a blacklist because getting this wrong leaves us vulnerable to a RCE attack.

Should I submit a separate PR to the `master` branch?

Sorry, something went wrong.

| What if we opened a file explaining why their file didn't open when a request is rejected? This would encourage them to file an issue, rename their file, or check their system and package tree for integrity.  Something like rce.md in our package internals.  Is there a npm package that checks this with greater accuracy? |

| I released `react-scripts@1.1.5` which enforces a version of `react-dev-utils` with this change. For `react-dev-utils`, I cut patches for every major version:   * `react-dev-utils@1.0.4` contains the fix * `react-dev-utils@2.0.2` contains the fix * `react-dev-utils@3.1.2` contains the fix * `react-dev-utils@4.2.2` contains the fix * `react-dev-utils@5.0.2` contains the fix   I'll also cut a new release from the `next` branch since `react-dev-utils` is pinned in alphas. |

| I may be missing something. Shouldn't the `fs.existsSync(fileName)` check already prevent the RCE? |

| [@ForbesLindesay](https://github.com/ForbesLindesay) I double-checked in the vulnerability report, and indeed there is a way to fool this check by forcing a browser to download a file with a specially crafted name. It requires knowing some easily guessable things about the attack target but it's not implausible. |
