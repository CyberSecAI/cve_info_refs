# USN-4165-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

23 October 2019

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 19.10](/security/notices?release=eoan)
* [Ubuntu 19.04](/security/notices?release=disco)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service, bypass security

restrictions, bypass same-origin restrictions, conduct cross-site

scripting (XSS) attacks, bypass content security policy (CSP) protections,

or execute arbitrary code.

[## Chrome Releases](/.)

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update for Desktop](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2018/07/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html "Stable Channel Update for Desktop")

Tuesday, July 24, 2018

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 68 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux. This will roll out over the coming days/weeks.

Chrome 68.0.3440.75 contains a number of fixes and improvements -- a list of changes is available in the[log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/67.0.3396.99..68.0.3440.75?pretty=fuller&n=10000). Watch out for upcoming[Chrome](https://chrome.blogspot.com/)Â and[Chromium](https://blog.chromium.org/)Â blog posts about new features and big efforts delivered in 68.

**HTTP Sites Marked as "Not Secure"**
In Chrome 68, Chrome will show the âNot secureâ warning on all HTTP pages. We announced this in a [blog post](https://security.googleblog.com/2018/02/a-secure-web-is-here-to-stay.html) published on February 8th on Googleâs Chromium and Online Security blogs.

To ensure that the Not Secure warning is not displayed for your pages in Chrome 68, we recommend migrating your site to HTTPS. The following [migration guide](//goo.gl/jKrUKt) provides migration recommendations and addresses common migration concerns such as SEO, ad revenue and performance impact.

**Security Fixes and Rewards**
*Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but havenât yet fixed.*

This update includes [42](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M68&colspec=ID+Pri+M+Stars+ReleaseBlock+Component+Status+Owner+Summary+OS+Modified&x=m&y=releaseblock&cells=ids) security fixes. Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers.Â Please see the [Chrome Security Page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

[[866821](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=866821)] Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives

The following bugs were fixed in previous Chrome releases, but were mistakenly omitted from the release notes at the time:

[$1000][[812667](https://crbug.com/812667)] Medium CVE-2018-6150: Cross origin information disclosure in Service Workers. *Reported by Rob Wu on 2018-02-15*

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer](https://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/undefinedbehaviorsanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity), [libFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer), or [AFL](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/).
