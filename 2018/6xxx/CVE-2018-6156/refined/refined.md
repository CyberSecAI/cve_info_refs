Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6156:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a **heap buffer overflow** within the WebRTC component of the browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap buffer overflow:** This occurs when data is written beyond the allocated memory region on the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The provided information doesn't explicitly detail the impact. However, heap buffer overflows can lead to:
    *   **Arbitrary code execution:** An attacker could potentially overwrite critical data structures in memory with malicious code.
    *   **Denial of service (DoS):** Overwriting data could cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly, leading to a denial of service.
    *   **Bypass of security restrictions:** Depending on the data overwritten, an attacker could bypass security checks or gain unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves WebRTC, which is commonly used for real-time communications in browsers.
*   The attacker needs to be able to trigger the specific code path with the heap buffer overflow in WebRTC.
*   Based on the Ubuntu Security Notice, this could be achieved by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would need to create a malicious website or find a way to inject code that triggers the vulnerability in the WebRTC component of the browser.
*   The attacker would need to lure the victim to visit the malicious website.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was reported by Natalie Silvanovich of Google Project Zero.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "High" severity.
*   The fix for this vulnerability is included in the Chrome 68 update and Firefox 70 update for Ubuntu.
*   The provided information from the Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-4165-1) shows that this vulnerability is among several other security issues fixed in Firefox. It notes that an attacker could cause a denial of service, bypass security restrictions, conduct XSS attacks, bypass CSP protections, or execute arbitrary code by getting a user to open a crafted website.
