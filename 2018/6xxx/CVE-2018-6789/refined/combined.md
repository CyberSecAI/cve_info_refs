Package        : exim4
Version        : 4.80-7+deb7u6
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-6789
Debian Bug     : 890000

Meh Chang discovered a buffer overflow flaw in a utility function used
in the SMTP listener of Exim, a mail transport agent. A remote attacker
can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service, or
potentially the execution of arbitrary code via a specially crafted
message.

For Debian 7 "Wheezy", this problem has been fixed in version
4.80-7+deb7u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your exim4 packages.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Subject: Exim 4.90.1 released. (Was: CVE-2018-6789 Exim 4.90 and earlier:
 buffer overflow)

We released Exim 4.90.1 just now.
---------------------------------

This is mainly a security release to fix CVE-2018-6789, a buffer
overflow in base64d(). Please update your systems to 4.90.1.  The
reporter of the bug claims to have a working exploit.  See
<http://exim.org/static/doc/security/CVE-2018-6789.txt> for the timeline.

This release contains some other important bug fixes since 4.90, but no
additional features. Please see the ChangeLog
ftp://ftp.exim.org/pub/exim/exim4/ChangeLog

The Distros should have built packages already.

The sources can be obtained directly from the Git repos

    git://git.exim.org/exim.git     tag: exim-4_90_1
    git://git.exim.org/exim.git     tag: exim-4_90_1

The tag is signed with my GPG key¹.

Alternativly you may fetch the tarballs from the mirrors listed
on
    <https://www.exim.org/mirmon/ftp_mirrors.html>

or directly from

      ftp://ftp.exim.org/pub/exim/exim4/
    <https://ftp.exim.org/pub/exim/exim4/>

The tarballs are signed with my GPG key¹. Next to the tarballs you will
find a sha512sum.txt, in case you are happy with simple integrity check
only.

¹) If you get a "key expired" message, please refresh my key from
the public keyservers.

Thank you for using Exim.

## Latest Version: 4.98

[![Exim Logo](i/exim-blue-ld-87x65.png)](https://www.exim.org/)Exim is a message transfer agent (MTA) originally developed at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/ "University of Cambridge Home page") for use on Unix systems connected to the Internet. It is freely available under the terms of the [GNU General Public Licence](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html "GPL Information"). In style it is similar to Smail 3,
but its facilities are more general. There is a great deal of flexibility in the way mail can be routed, and there are extensive facilities for checking incoming mail. Exim can be installed in place of [Sendmail](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/sendmail-open-source "Sendmail home page"), although the configuration of Exim is quite different.

All versions of Exim previous to version 4.98 are now obsolete. The last 3.x release was 3.36. It is twenty years obsolete and should not be used.

The current version is 4.98.

If necessary, we publish maintenance releases. These releases are mainly intended for package maintainers.

There may be beta versions available from the ftp sites in the Testing directory. Many people are using these without problems, but they are not recommended unless you are willing to work with beta software.

[![](i/exim-book.png)](https://www.uit.co.uk/all-books/the-exim-smtp-mail-server.html)You may wish to purchase [The Exim SMTP Mail Server](https://www.uit.co.uk/all-books/the-exim-smtp-mail-server.html) book, written by the original author of Exim, [Philip Hazel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Hazel).

The following organizations provide services which help the Exim project:

* [Mythic Beasts](https://www.mythic-beasts.com/) provide us with a VM for running the buildfarm, for the testsuite.
* [![MacStadium](i/macstadium-150x61.png)MacStadium](https://www.macstadium.com/) provide us a Mac Mini for our buildfarm, keeping macOS supported.
* [Schlittermann - Internet & Unix Support](https://schlittermann.de/) provide us resources for hosting and administering the exim.org infrastructure.

# Preface

This short book is written for people who want to understand the internals of 'heap memory', particularly the implementation of glibc's 'malloc' and 'free' procedures, and also for security researchers who want to get started in the field of heap exploitation.

The first section of the book covers an in-depth, yet concise, description about heap internals. The second section covers some of the most famous attacks. It is assumed that the reader is unfamiliar with this topic. For experienced readers, this text might be good for a quick revision.

* This is not the final version and will keep on updating. For contributing see [this](https://github.com/DhavalKapil/heap-exploitation/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
* The source code for the book can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/DhavalKapil/heap-exploitation).
* The canonical URL for the book is <https://heap-exploitation.dhavalkapil.com>.
* You can subscribe for updates on [the book website](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dhavalkapil/heap-exploitation/details).

[Read for free online](https://heap-exploitation.dhavalkapil.com/) (recommended) or download the [PDF](https://www.gitbook.com/download/pdf/book/dhavalkapil/heap-exploitation) or [ePUB](https://www.gitbook.com/download/epub/book/dhavalkapil/heap-exploitation) or [Mobi/Kindle](https://www.gitbook.com/download/mobi/book/dhavalkapil/heap-exploitation) editions.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Subject: CVE-2018-6789 Exim 4.90 and earlier: buffer overflow

CVE-2018-6789 Exim 4.90 and earlier
===================================

There is a buffer overflow in an utility function, if some pre-conditions
are met.  Using a handcrafted message, remote code execution seems to be
possible.

A patch exists already and is being tested.

Currently we're unsure about the severity, we *believe*, an exploit
is difficult. A mitigation isn't known.

Next steps:

* t0:     Distros will get access to our "security" non-public git repo
          (based on the SSH keys known to us)
* t0 +7d: Patch will be published on the official public git repo

t0 will be around 2018-02-08.

Timeline
--------

* 2018-02-05 Report from Meh Chang <meh@...co.re> via exim-security mailing list
* 2018-02-06 Request CVE on <https://cveform.mitre.org/> (heiko)
             CVE-2018-6789
* 2018-02-07 Announcement to the public via exim-users, exim-maintainers
             mailing lists and on oss-security mailing list

Updates will follow. Here and on <https://exim.org/security/CVE-2018-6789.txt>
(Link will start to exist around 11.00 UTC).

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

CVE-2018-6789
=============
There is a buffer overflow in base64d(), if some pre-conditions are met.
Using a handcrafted message, remote code execution seems to be possible.
A patch exists already and is being tested.
Currently we're unsure about the severity, we \*believe\*, an exploit
is difficult. A mitigation isn't known.

## Overview

We reported an overflow vulnerability in the base64 decode function of [**Exim**](https://www.exim.org/) on 5 February, 2018, identified as [CVE-2018-6789](https://exim.org/static/doc/security/CVE-2018-6789.txt). This bug exists since the first commit of exim, hence **ALL versions** are affected. According to our research, it can be leveraged to gain **Pre-auth Remote Code Execution** and at least 400k servers are at risk. Patched version 4.90.1 is already released and we suggest to upgrade exim immediately.

## Affected

* All Exim versions below 4.90.1

# One byte overflow in base64 decoding

### Vulnerability Analysis

This is a calculation mistake of decode buffer length in `b64decode` function:
[base64.c: 153 b64decode](https://github.com/Exim/exim/blob/master/src/src/base64.c#L153)

```
b64decode(const uschar *code, uschar **ptr)
{
int x, y;
uschar *result = store_get(3*(Ustrlen(code)/4) + 1);

*ptr = result;
// perform decoding
}

```

As shown above, exim allocates a buffer of `3*(len/4)+1` bytes to store decoded base64 data. However, when the input is not a valid base64 string and the length is `4n+3`, exim allocates `3n+1` but consumes `3n+2` bytes while decoding. This causes one byte heap overflow (aka off-by-one).
Generally, this bug is harmless because the memory overwritten is usually unused. However, this byte overwrites some critical data when the string fits some specific length. In addition, this byte is controllable, which makes exploitation more feasible.
Base64 decoding is such a fundamental function and therefore this bug can be triggered easily, causing remote code execution.

### Exploitation

To estimate the severity of this bug, we developed an exploit targeting SMTP daemon of exim. The exploitation mechanism used to achieve pre-auth remote code execution is described in the following paragraphs. In order to leverage this one byte overflow, it is necessary to trick memory management mechanism. It is highly recommended to have basic knowledge of heap exploitation [[ref]](#heap_exp) before reading this section.

We developed the exploit with:

* **Debian(stretch)** and **Ubuntu(zesty)**
* **SMTP daemon of Exim4 package** installed with apt-get (4.89/4.88)
* Config enabled (uncommented in default config) **CRAM-MD5 authenticator** (any other authenticator using base64 also works)
* Basic SMTP commands (**EHLO, MAIL FROM/RCPT TO**) and **AUTH**

#### Memory allocation

First, we review the source code and search for useful memory allocation. As we mentioned in the previous article, exim uses self-defined functions for dynamic allocation:

```
extern BOOL    store_extend_3(void *, int, int, const char *, int);  /* The */
extern void    store_free_3(void *, const char *, int);     /* value of the */
extern void   *store_get_3(int, const char *, int);         /* 2nd arg is   */
extern void   *store_get_perm_3(int, const char *, int);    /* __FILE__ in  */
extern void   *store_malloc_3(int, const char *, int);      /* every call,  */
extern void    store_release_3(void *, const char *, int);  /* so give its  */
extern void    store_reset_3(void *, const char *, int);    /* correct type */

```

Function `store_free()` and `store_malloc()` calls `malloc()` and `free()` of glibc directly. Glibc takes a slightly bigger (`0x10` bytes) **chunk** and stores its metadata in the first `0x10` bytes (x86-64) on every allocation, and then returns the location of `data`. The following illustration describes structure of chunk:
![](/assets/img/blog/20180306/1.png)

Metadata includes size of previous chunk (the one exactly above in memory), size of current block and some flags. The first three bits of `size` are used to store flags. In this example, size of `0x81` implies current chunk is `0x80` bytes and the previous chunk is in use.
Most of released chunks used in exim are put into a doubly linked list called **unsorted bin**. Glibc maintains it according to the flags, and merges adjacent released chunks into a bigger chunk to avoid fragmentation. For every allocation request, glibc checks these chunks in an FIFO (first in, first-out) order and reuses the chunks.

For some performance issues, exim maintains its own linked list structure with `store_get()`, `store_release()`, `store_extend()` and `store_reset()`.
![architecture of storeblock](/assets/img/blog/20180306/2.png)
The main feature of storeblocks is that every block is at least `0x2000` bytes, which becomes a restriction to our exploitation. Note that a storeblock is also the `data` of a chunk. Therefore, if we look into the memory, it is like:
![](/assets/img/blog/20180306/3.png)

Here we list functions used to arrange heap data:

* EHLO hostname
  For each EHLO(or HELO) command, exim stores the pointer of hostname in `sender_host_name`.
  + `store_free()` old name
  + `store_malloc()` for new name

  [smtp\_in.c: 1833 check\_helo](https://github.com/Exim/exim/blob/master/src/src/smtp_in.c#L1833)

  ```
    1839 /* Discard any previous helo name */
    1840
    1841 if (sender_helo_name != NULL)
    1842   {
    1843   store_free(sender_helo_name);
    1844   sender_helo_name = NULL;
    1845   }
    ...
    1884 if (yield) sender_helo_name = string_copy_malloc(start);
    1885 return yield;

  ```
* Unrecognized command
  For every unrecognized command with unprintable characters, exim allocates a buffer to convert it to printable
  + `store_get()` to store error message

  [smtp\_in.c: 5725 smtp\_setup\_msg](https://github.com/Exim/exim/blob/master/src/src/smtp_in.c#L5725)

  ```
    5725   done = synprot_error(L_smtp_syntax_error, 500, NULL,
    5726     US"unrecognized command");

  ```
* AUTH
  In most authentication procedure, exim uses base64 encoding to communicate with client. The encode and decode string are stored in a buffer allocated by `store_get()`.
  + `store_get()` for strings
  + can contain unprintable characters, NULL bytes
  + not necessarily null terminated
* Reset in EHLO/HELO, MAIL, RCPT
  When a command is done correctly, `smtp_reset()` is called. This function calls `store_reset()` to reset block chain to a **reset point**, which means all storeblocks allocated by `store_get()` after last command are released.
  + `store_reset()` to reset point (set at the beginning of function)
  + release blocks added at a time

  [smtp\_in.c: 3771 smtp\_setup\_msg](https://github.com/Exim/exim/blob/master/src/src/smtp_in.c#L3771)

  ```
    3771 int
    3772 smtp_setup_msg(void)
    3773 {
    3774 int done = 0;
    3775 BOOL toomany = FALSE;
    3776 BOOL discarded = FALSE;
    3777 BOOL last_was_rej_mail = FALSE;
    3778 BOOL last_was_rcpt = FALSE;
    3779 void *reset_point = store_get(0);
    3780
    3781 DEBUG(D_receive) debug_printf("smtp_setup_msg entered\n");
    3782
    3783 /* Reset for start of new message. We allow one RSET not to be counted as a
    3784 nonmail command, for those MTAs that insist on sending it between every
    3785 message. Ditto for EHLO/HELO and for STARTTLS, to allow for going in and out of
    3786 TLS between messages (an Exim client may do this if it has messages queued up
    3787 for the host). Note: we do NOT reset AUTH at this point. */
    3788
    3789 smtp_reset(reset_point);

  ```

#### Exploit steps

To leverage this off-by-one, the chunk beneath decoded base64 data should be freed easily and controllable. After several attempts, we found that `sender_host_name` is a better choice. We arrange the heap layout to leave a freed chunk above `sender_host_name` for the base64 data.

1. Put a huge chunk into unsorted bin
   First of all, we send a EHLO message with huge hostname to make it allocate and deallocate, leaving a `0x6060` length (3 storeblocks long) chunk in unsorted bin.
2. Cut the first storeblock
   Then we send an unrecognized string to trigger `store_get()` and allocate a storeblock inside the freed chunk.
3. Cut the second storeblock and release the first one
   We send a EHLO message again to get the second storeblock. The first block is freed sequentially because of the `smtp_reset` called after EHLO is done.

   After the heap layout is prepared, we can use the off-by-one to overwrite the original chunk size. We modify `0x2021` to `0x20f1`, which slightly extends the chunk.

   ![](/assets/img/blog/20180306/5.png)
4. Send base64 data and trigger off-by-one
   To trigger off-by-one, we start an AUTH command to send base64 data. The overflow byte precisely overwrites the first byte of next chunk and extends the next chunk.
5. Forge a reasonable chunk size
   Because the chunk is extended, the start of next chunk of is changed to somewhere inside of the original one. Therefore, we need to make it **seems like** a normal chunk to pass sanity checks in glibc. We send another base64 string here, because it requires `NULL` byte and unprintable character to forge chunk size.
6. Release the extended chunk
   To control the content of extended chunk, we need to release the chunk first because we cannot edit it directly. That is, we should send a new EHLO message to release the old host name. However, normal EHLO message calls `smtp_reset` after it succeeds, which possibly makes program abort or crash. To avoid this, we send an **invalid** host name such as `a+`.
7. Overwrite the **`next`** pointer of overlapped storeblock

   ![](/assets/img/blog/20180306/6.png)
   After the chunk is released, we can retrieve it with AUTH and overwrite part of overlapped storeblock. Here we use a trick called **partial write**. With this, we can modify the pointer without breaking **ASLR** (Address space layout randomization). We partially changed the `next` pointer to a storeblock containing ACL (Access Control List) strings. The ACL strings are pointed by a set of global pointers such as:

   ```
    uschar *acl_smtp_auth;
    uschar *acl_smtp_data;
    uschar *acl_smtp_etrn;
    uschar *acl_smtp_expn;
    uschar *acl_smtp_helo;
    uschar *acl_smtp_mail;
    uschar *acl_smtp_quit;
    uschar *acl_smtp_rcpt;

   ```

   These pointers are initialized at the beginning of exim process, set according to the configure. For example, if there is a line `acl_smtp_mail = acl_check_mail` in the configure, the pointer `acl_smtp_mail` points to the string `acl_check_mail`. Whenever MAIL FROM is used, exim performs an ACL check, which expands `acl_check_mail` first. While expanding, exim tries to execute commands if it encounters `${run{cmd}}`, so we achieve code execution as long as we control the ACL strings. In addition, we do not need to hijack program control flow directly and therefore we can bypass mitigations such as **PIE** (Position Independent Executables), **NX** easily.
8. Reset storeblocks and retrieve the ACL storeblock
   Now the ACL storeblock is in the linked list chain. It will be released once `smtp_reset()` is triggered, and then we can retrieve it again by allocating multiple blocks.
9. Overwrite ACL strings and trigger ACL check
   Finally, we overwrite the whole block containing ACL strings. Now we send commands such as EHLO, MAIL, RCPT to trigger ACL checks. Once we touch an acl defined in the configure, we achieve remote code execution.

=head1 Exim Development Repository

This is the Exim (Mail Transport Agent) Development Repository. Please
read the following information if you wish to use or contribute to the
Exim development process - this is to prevent your or our time being
unnecessarily wasted.

If you just want to use, build or get information on Exim then have a
look at the pointers further down this file at L<General Exim Information>.

=head2 General Development Information

The general Exim development process and resources are documented in
the wiki page at L<http://wiki.exim.org/EximDevelopment> - although
the wiki is likely to be moved and rehashed in the near future.

The sections below this duplicate much of the information form the
wiki document.

=head2 Development Repositories

Exim development is kept within a  git (L<https://git-scm.com/>)
repository. The master repository is at L<git://git.exim.org/exim.git>
with a web interface giving change and source visibility at
L<https://git.exim.org/exim.git>

There is a secondary repository on github at
L<https://github.com/Exim/exim> managed by the Exim Organisation
- however this may currently fall out of synchronisation with the
main one.

=head2 Bug Tracking

Currently this is all done using Bugzilla at L<https://bugs.exim.org/>
- please do not use github issue tracking.

=head2 Mailing List

Development issues are normally discussed on the exim-dev mailing list
- see L<https://www.exim.org/maillist.html>

=head2 Exim Release Process

Some documentation on the release process can be found at
L<http://wiki.exim.org/EximRelease>.

=head2 General Exim Information

The best place to get general information is on the website at
L<https://www.exim.org/>.

You can find Download locations L<https://www.exim.org/mirrors.html>,
Mailing list info L<https://www.exim.org/maillist.html> and Full
Documentation L<https://www.exim.org/docs.html> on that website.

If you are using a Linux or other freely available Unix like operating
system it is very likely that your system will have Exim packaged for
it already. In this case it is probably prudent to use these packages
unless you have specialised requirements.

In any case you can always ask on the
Exim Users mailing list L<https://lists.exim.org/mailman3/postorius/lists/exim-users.lists.exim.org/>
for further information.

## Binary packages built by this source

[exim4](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/exim4):
metapackage to ease Exim MTA (v4) installation

Exim (v4) is a mail transport agent. exim4 is the metapackage depending

 on the essential components for a basic exim4 installation.

 .

 The Debian exim4 packages have their own web page,

 <http://wiki.debian.org/PkgExim4>. There is also a Debian-specific

 FAQ list. Information about the way the Debian packages are

 configured can be found in

 /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/README.Debian.gz, which additionally contains

 information about the way the Debian binary packages are built. The

 very extensive upstream documentation is shipped in

 /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/spec.txt.gz. To repeat the debconf-driven

 configuration process in a standard setup, invoke dpkg-reconfigure

 exim4-config. There is a Debian-centered mailing list,

 pkg-exim4-users@lists.alioth.debian.org. Please ask Debian-specific

 questions there, and only write to the upstream exim-users mailing

 list if you are sure that your question is not Debian-specific. You

 can find the subscription web page on

 <http://lists.alioth.debian.org/mailman/listinfo/pkg-exim4-users>

[exim4-base](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/exim4-base):
support files for all Exim MTA (v4) packages

Exim (v4) is a mail transport agent. exim4-base provides the support

 files needed by all exim4 daemon packages. You need an additional package

 containing the main executable. The available packages are:

 .

  exim4-daemon-light

  exim4-daemon-heavy

 .

 If you build exim4 from the source package locally, you can also

 build an exim4-daemon-custom package tailored to your own feature set.

 .

 The Debian exim4 packages have their own web page,

 <http://wiki.debian.org/PkgExim4>. There is also a Debian-specific

debug symbols for package exim4-base

Exim (v4) is a mail transport agent. exim4-base provides the support

 files needed by all exim4 daemon packages. You need an additional package

 containing the main executable. The available packages are:

 .

[exim4-config](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/exim4-config):
configuration for the Exim MTA (v4)

Exim (v4) is a mail transport agent. exim4-config provides the configuration

 for the exim4 daemon packages. The configuration framework has been split

 off the main package to allow sites to replace the configuration scheme

 with their own without having to change the actual exim4 packages.

 .

 Sites with special configuration needs (having a lot of identically

 configured machines for example) can use this to distribute their own

 custom configuration via the packaging system, using the magic

 available with dpkg's conffile handling, without having to do local

 changes on all of these machines.

 .

#### Vulnerability Information

Vulnerability Type

CWE-ID

Definition

Buffer Overflow

[CWE-119](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)

The software performs operations on a memory buffer, but it can read from or write to a memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer.

Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

[CWE-79](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

SQL Injection

[CWE-89](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)

The software constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Directory Traversal

[CWE-22](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)

The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the software does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

XML External Entity (XXE)

[CWE-611](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html)

The software processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.

Insecure Permissions

[CWE-276](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/276.html)

The software, upon installation, sets incorrect permissions for an object that exposes it to an unintended actor.

Incorrect Access Control

[CWE-284](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)

The software does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.

Integer Overflow

[CWE-190](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html)

The software performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or execution control.

Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

[CWE-352](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html)

The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

Missing SSL certification verification

[CWE-599](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/599.html)

The software uses OpenSSL and trusts or uses a certificate without using the SSL\_get\_verify\_result() function to ensure that the certificate satisfies all necessary security requirements.

Other or Unknown

N/A

The software contains a mistake other than above which can be directly used by a hacker to gain access to a system or network.
