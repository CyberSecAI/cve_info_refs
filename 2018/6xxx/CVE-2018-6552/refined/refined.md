**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of core dumps and missing `/proc` files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Denial of service
*   Escalation of privileges
*   Container escape

**Attack vectors:**
* Local attacker

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
* Local access to the system.
* Ability to trigger a crash in a process.

**Additional Details:**
The vulnerability was discovered by Sander Bos. The fix involves properly handling crashes originating from a PID namespace. This issue affects multiple versions of Ubuntu.

Sander Bos discovered that Apport incorrectly handled core dumps when

certain files are missing from /proc. A local attacker could possibly use

this issue to cause a denial of service, gain root privileges, or escape

from containers.
