Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6340:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from an improper use of `snprintf()` in the `Memcache::getextendedstats` function of HHVM. `snprintf()` returns the number of bytes that *would* have been written if the buffer had enough space, not the number of bytes actually written to the buffer. The code was using this return value as the length of a string, assuming that the output would be truncated. This incorrect assumption allowed for the creation of a string with a length longer than the buffer and thus a buffer over-read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Buffer Over-read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read due to the incorrect handling of the `snprintf()` return value. The code used the return value of `snprintf` as the length for a newly created String object, which could cause the string to read beyond the bounds of the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Leakage:** By controlling the hostname and port of memcached servers, an attacker could cause the `Memcache::getextendedstats` function to read from arbitrary locations on the stack, potentially leaking sensitive information.
- **Crash:** While not explicitly stated, an out-of-bounds read can lead to a crash of the HHVM process, causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability can be triggered through the `Memcache::getextendedstats` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Control over memcached server hostnames and/or ports:** An attacker needs to have the ability to control the hostnames and/or ports of the memcached servers that the HHVM instance is connecting to. This control allows them to specify lengthy hostnames/ports that trigger the `snprintf` overflow and the subsequent out-of-bounds read.

**Additional Information:**

- The fix involved constructing the output string by properly assembling it with the hostname and port, instead of relying on `snprintf`'s return value and a fixed buffer size.

- The vulnerability affects all supported versions of HHVM (3.30, 3.27.4, and below) prior to the fix.

- The provided GitHub commit ([4bff3bf](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/4bff3bfbe90d10451e4638c2118d1ad1117bb3e3)) shows the code changes that address this vulnerability.

- HHVM versions 3.30.1 and 3.27.5 include the fix for this issue.
