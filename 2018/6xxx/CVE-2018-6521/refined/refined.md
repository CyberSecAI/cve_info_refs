Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-6521:

**Root Cause:**
- The `sqlauth` module in SimpleSAMLphp, when using MySQL, utilized the `utf8` connection charset. This charset does not fully support UTF-8 encoding and truncates queries when encountering four-byte unicode characters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Insecure connection charset: The use of `utf8` instead of `utf8mb4` for MySQL connections leads to query truncation when handling specific unicode characters (those represented with four bytes).
- Potential for SQL query truncation

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- While the provided documents indicate that there is no known way to exploit the vulnerability directly due to the use of prepared statements and `select` queries, it does state the following potential impacts, in combination with unknown issues:
    - Authentication bypass: An attacker could potentially bypass authentication by manipulating the input in a way that bypasses the intended access restrictions.
    - Unauthorized database manipulation: An attacker could potentially gain access to modify the user's credentials database.
    - Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Although not directly exploitable in this instance due to the use of select queries, the potential exists for stored XSS attacks, running arbitrary code in the victimâ€™s web browser if used with insert/update statements.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability lies within the interaction between the `sqlauth` module and a MySQL database when processing user input containing four-byte unicode characters.
- Attack vector involves crafting specific usernames or passwords containing these unsupported characters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have the ability to input data into the authentication process of the SimpleSAMLphp system using the `sqlauth:SQL` authentication source with a MySQL backend.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the database schema and the fact that the vulnerable software is in use.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is considered low severity due to mitigating factors: the use of prepared statements prevents SQL injection and truncation, and the module utilizes `select` queries, which prevents the possibility of Stored XSS attacks. However, the issue is still being addressed with a fix.
- The vulnerability is fixed by changing the connection charset from `utf8` to `utf8mb4` when using a MySQL backend.
- The advisory notes that this vulnerability was discovered by Cure53 during a security audit.
