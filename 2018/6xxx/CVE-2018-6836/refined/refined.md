- Root cause of vulnerability: An invalid address is passed to the `free()` function due to parsing a crafted pcap file.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: A crafted pcap file can cause an illegal memory access by triggering a free() call on an invalid address.
- Impact of exploitation: The program crashes due to the invalid memory access.
- Attack vectors: A maliciously crafted pcap file.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted pcap file to the vulnerable application, such as by opening it.
