- **Root Cause:** Inadequate DoS protection in FreeBSD's IP fragment reassembly implementation.
- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The system is vulnerable to resource exhaustion due to crafted IP fragments, specifically:
    - Excessive CPU consumption by processing crafted fragments.
    - Consumption of mbuf clusters leading to denial of service.
- **Impact of Exploitation:** 
    -  System becomes temporarily unreachable through network interfaces.
    - System becomes temporarily unresponsive.
    -  Resource exhaustion (CPU and mbuf clusters).
- **Attack Vectors:** Sending streams of crafted IP fragments, without the need for two-way communication.
- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker can be remote and does not require two-way communication. They only need to be able to send network packets to the target.

This advisory provides more details than a basic CVE description, detailing specific impacts and attack vectors related to IP fragment reassembly.
