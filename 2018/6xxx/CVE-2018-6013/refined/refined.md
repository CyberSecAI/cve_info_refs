The provided content relates to CVE-2018-6013.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `directory` parameter of the `file-browser.php` script. The script directly uses the user-provided `directory` value in the construction of a file path, which allows for the injection of arbitrary script code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser session. This can lead to various malicious activities such as:
- Session hijacking
- Data theft
- Defacement of the web application
- Redirection to malicious websites.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to `core/admin/ajax/developer/extensions/file-browser.php` with a crafted `directory` parameter containing malicious JavaScript code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to send an HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoint with the malicious payload. No specific user privileges are mentioned to be required, and it appears the attacker would be able to exploit this vulnerability remotely.
