  "CVE-2018-6481": {
    "related_content": true,
    "description": "Disk Savvy Enterprise v10.4.18 suffers from an unauthenticated remote buffer overflow vulnerability. The vulnerability lies in the handling of a specific packet type. By sending a specially crafted packet with an oversized payload, an attacker can overwrite the Structured Exception Handler (SEH) and gain control of the execution flow.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to insufficient bounds checking when processing a specific packet type with a large payload. The server fails to validate the size of the incoming data before copying it into a fixed-size buffer.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer Overflow",
        "Insufficient Input Validation"
      ],
       "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain arbitrary code execution on the vulnerable server. This allows for complete control of the target system, potentially leading to data exfiltration, further network compromise, or denial of service.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack is performed remotely over a network via TCP port 9124. A specially crafted packet is sent to the server.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need prior authentication and requires the ability to send network packets to the target server.",
      "additional_details": "The provided exploit code demonstrates overwriting the SEH to redirect execution flow to attacker-controlled shellcode, specifically a reverse TCP shell. The exploit targets a specific version of Disk Savvy Enterprise on Windows x86."
