The provided content is related to CVE-2018-6948.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `ccnl_prefix_to_str_detailed` function in ccn-lite is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. This occurs when the function writes a prefix to a buffer (`buf`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer Overflow: The size of the buffer `buf` is equal to `CCNL_MAX_PREFIX_SIZE`. However, when NFN (Named Function Networking) is enabled, additional characters like "NFN" and "R2C" tags are also written to the buffer. This can cause an overflow of the buffer if the prefix is already at maximum size (`CCNL_MAX_PREFIX_SIZE`) when combined with the additional NFN/R2C tags.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability can lead to crashes, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted NFN-R2C packet with a prefix of maximum size (`CCNL_MAX_PREFIX_SIZE`) when NFN is enabled can trigger the overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to a system running ccn-lite with NFN enabled. Specifically, the attacker needs to craft a NFN-R2C packet with a prefix of maximum size.
