Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of **CVE-2018-6198**:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The w3m application doesn't handle temporary files properly when the `~/.w3m` directory is unwritable. Specifically, when `~/.w3m` is not writable, w3m uses `/tmp` for temporary files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure temporary file creation
-  The application creates temporary files in `/tmp` without proper precautions (e.g., using `mkdtemp` or similar).
- Symlink attack vulnerability: A local attacker can create a symlink in the `/tmp` directory, which w3m will follow when writing temporary files, resulting in arbitrary file overwrites.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A local attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the system.
- This could lead to data corruption, system instability, or potential privilege escalation if carefully crafted symlinks and target files are chosen.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access is required. An attacker needs to have shell access on the target machine.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs to have local user-level access on the system
- Attacker needs to know or be able to discover that `~/.w3m` is not writable by the victim user.
- The attacker must have write access to `/tmp` to create the malicious symlinks.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The fix implemented was to use `mkdtemp()` to create temporary directories in `/tmp`
- The issue is triggered when w3m attempts to create a temporary directory or file in `~/.w3m` but the directory is not writable for some reason.
- The vulnerability is also described as a "file race" issue.
- Some sources indicate a reliance on kernel hardening to mitigate the issue, but a proper fix in the application was still necessary.
