Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-6965:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read issue within the shader translator of VMware ESXi, Workstation, and Fusion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core issue is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. This means the software attempts to read data from a memory location that it is not authorized to access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers may be able to read sensitive data from memory.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers with normal user privileges could potentially crash their virtual machines.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the shader translator component of the affected VMware products, implying the attacker would need to trigger the vulnerable code path during shader processing. This means they would have to have some form of interaction with the VM and its graphics rendering process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to execute code that uses the vulnerable shader translation component within a virtual machine.
*   For a crash (DoS), the attacker needs only "normal user privileges" within the VM, according to the advisory.
*   For information disclosure, the necessary privileges might be the same but this is not explicitly mentioned.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was reported by RanchoIce of Tencent ZhanluLab and a member of Cisco Talos.
*   Patches were released to address this vulnerability in ESXi 6.7, Workstation 14.x, and Fusion 10.x.
*   ESXi versions 6.5, 6.0 and 5.5 are not affected.
