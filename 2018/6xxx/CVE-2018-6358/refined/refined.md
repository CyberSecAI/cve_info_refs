Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6358:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow in the `printDefineFont2` function (in `util/listfdb.c`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists when processing a crafted FDB file. Specifically, the `printDefineFont2` function allocates a buffer on the heap and writes to it without proper bounds checking, causing a buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) can be caused by the heap buffer overflow, potentially leading to application crashes.
- The Debian security advisory mentions "unspecified other impact" as a possibility.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted FDB file.
- Attackers can exploit the vulnerability remotely by providing a malicious FDB file to the affected software.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attackers need the ability to provide the vulnerable application with a crafted FDB file as input.
- No special privileges or authentication is explicitly mentioned.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects libming versions up to and including 0.4.8, including the master branch.
- A proof of concept (PoC) FDB file is available on GitHub at the provided URL, which can trigger the overflow.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by hlef.
- The issue was addressed in Debian by updating the ming package to version 0.4.4-1.1+deb7u8.
- Gentoo lists the vulnerability as part of GLSA 201904-24 and recommends updating to version 0.20181112 or later.
- The AddressSanitizer output shows a write of size 4 that overflows a 4-byte region.
