Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6075:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an "overly permissive cross-origin downloads" issue in the Chromium browser. This means that the browser was not properly restricting the ability of websites to initiate downloads from other origins (different domains, ports, or protocols).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is the browser's failure to enforce strict cross-origin download policies. This allows a malicious website to potentially trigger downloads from other origins without proper authorization or user consent.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The exploitation of this vulnerability could have various impacts:
- **Bypassing Security Policies:** It bypasses the intended restrictions on cross-origin interactions, allowing malicious sites to trigger unintended actions.
- **Potential for Data Exfiltration:** In some scenarios, it may enable an attacker to exfiltrate sensitive data by initiating downloads from a trusted origin to a location controlled by the attacker.
- **Malware Distribution:** Attackers could potentially leverage this to download and install malware on the victim's machine.
- **Phishing Attacks:** The ability to trigger downloads from seemingly trusted sources could be used to trick users into downloading malicious content.

**Attack Vectors:**
The primary attack vector involves a malicious website that exploits the relaxed cross-origin download policy. The website can trick the browser into initiating downloads from other origins, bypassing the security mechanisms.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website or inject malicious content into an existing website.
- The victim needs to visit the malicious website using a vulnerable version of the Chromium browser.

**Summary**

In summary, CVE-2018-6075 describes an overly permissive cross-origin download vulnerability in the Chromium browser. It allows a malicious website to bypass intended security measures and trigger downloads from different origins, potentially leading to data exfiltration, malware distribution, or phishing attacks. A user needs to visit a malicious website to be affected by this vulnerability.
