Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2018-6755:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The primary issue lies in the `SecureExecuteCommand::Execute` method of the McAfee True Key service, where it fails to properly validate the digital signature of the executable it's about to run. Instead of verifying the signature's validity, it merely extracts the X509 certificate from the security data directory using `X509Certificate.CreateFromSignedFile`. This method only extracts the certificate and doesn't check if it's a valid signature allowing an attacker to apply the security data directory from a valid signed file to an arbitrary file to bypass the verification checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1. **Improper Signature Validation:** The service doesn't verify the validity of the Authenticode signature, it just extracts the certificate.
2. **Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Vulnerabilities:** Multiple TOCTOU issues exist when accessing the file to be executed. The file is opened and closed multiple times during the execution flow. This allows an attacker to change the file between checks using symbolic links.
3. **Insecure File Deletion:** The service deletes arbitrary paths as the SYSTEM user.
4.  **Insecure Client Registration:** The service uses a provided TCP port number from the client to verify the process ID. It does not extract this from the TCP server.
5. **Process Path Spoofing:** The method used to extract the calling process' path is taken from the target process' memory and is therefore under attacker control.
6.  **Insecure Shared Data:** The CleanupCommand deletes values from a shared location that any user can manipulate.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
1. **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code as the SYSTEM user by exploiting the lack of proper signature validation or TOCTOU flaws.
2. **Arbitrary File Deletion:** Attackers can delete any file on the disk as a privileged user through symbolic links.
3. **Service Impersonation:** The vulnerability in client registration allows an attacker to spoof the connection.
4.  **Data manipulation:** The CleanupCommand can be abused to delete arbitrary files or directories via symbolic links in an insecure shared directory.

**Attack Vectors:**
1. **Local:** The vulnerabilities are exploitable by a local attacker who has the ability to execute code on the target system.
2. **Symbolic Link Manipulation:** Using mount point symbolic links to redirect file paths to different locations at different stages of the execution of `SecureExecuteCommand::Execute` to cause it to execute an attacker controlled binary or delete an attacker controlled file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1. **Local User Access:** The attacker needs to have local user access to the system where McAfee True Key is installed.
2. **Ability to Create Files and Symbolic Links:** The attacker needs to be able to create files, directories, and symbolic links on the file system.
3. **Ability to Execute Code:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the system.
