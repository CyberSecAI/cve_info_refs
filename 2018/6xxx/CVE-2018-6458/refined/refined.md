Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-6458

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Easy Hosting Control Panel (EHCP) v0.37.12.b lacks Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection. Specifically, it does not use security tokens to validate requests, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The primary weakness is the absence of CSRF protection mechanisms. This allows an attacker to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Database Manipulation:** An attacker can delete databases associated with the victim's account by luring the user to click a malicious link.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can stop critical services like Apache, Nginx, MySQL, and vsftpd, leading to a denial of service by the means of a CSRF attack.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Links/URIs:** The attack vector involves tricking an authenticated user into clicking on a specially crafted malicious link or URI. This link triggers actions on the EHCP control panel without the user's explicit consent.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need to directly interact with the EHCP server.
*   The attacker needs to be able to convince an authenticated user of EHCP to click a malicious link/URI.
*   The attacker doesn't need any special privileges on the server, as the vulnerability exploits the authenticated user's session.

**Additional Information:**
*   The provided document includes example URLs showing how to trigger the described vulnerabilities, such as deleting a database or stopping the Apache server.
*   The vendor was notified of the issue on January 26, 2018, and the public disclosure of the vulnerability occurred on May 9, 2018, after multiple requests for updates.
