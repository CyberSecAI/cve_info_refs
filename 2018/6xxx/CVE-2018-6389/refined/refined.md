Due to insufficient input sanitization, an attacker can supply a large number of valid file names within the `load[]` parameter, causing the server to perform multiple file reads and generate a large response, leading to resource exhaustion.",

This parameter is intended to load multiple JS modules in a single request, improving performance by reducing the number of requests made by a client. However, due to lack of input sanitization and authentication, an attacker can exploit this by sending a specially crafted request with a large list of valid JS modules. This forces the server to read and compile numerous files into a single response, consuming significant resources and potentially leading to a denial-of-service.",
