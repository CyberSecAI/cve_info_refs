Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-6074:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a "mark-of-the-web bypass" flaw in the Chromium browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Mark-of-the-Web Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability to bypass the "mark-of-the-web" security feature. This feature is designed to mark files downloaded from the internet with metadata indicating their origin. This metadata is then used by the operating system to determine if a file should be treated as potentially unsafe.  Bypassing this mechanism means a downloaded file could be treated as a local trusted file, thus potentially allowing it to execute with fewer restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Security Feature Bypass:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the "mark-of-the-web" security mechanism, leading to downloaded files being treated as if they originated from the local machine.
*   **Malware Execution:** If a user executes the bypassed downloaded file, they may be at a higher risk of malware infection.  This bypass could facilitate the execution of malicious code on the user's system without the usual warnings or restrictions associated with downloaded content from the internet.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Downloaded Files:** The attack vector is primarily through files downloaded from the internet. An attacker can distribute malicious files, and by using this vulnerability, they can make it appear as if these files are trusted and local.
*   **Web-based Attacks:** Attackers could leverage web-based attacks to deliver malicious files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Delivery of Malicious File:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious file to a user through a web browser.
*   **No specific user interaction beyond downloading the file is needed to trigger the vulnerability**

**Additional Notes:**

*   This CVE is part of a larger group of vulnerabilities fixed in Chromium version 65.0.3325.146.
*   The vulnerability affects Linux and likely other platforms where chromium browser is used.
*   Red Hat has issued RHSA-2018:0484 to address this vulnerability, indicating its importance.
