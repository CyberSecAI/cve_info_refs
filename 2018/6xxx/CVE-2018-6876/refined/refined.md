Based on the provided information, this issue report on GitHub describes a stack-buffer-underflow vulnerability in ImageMagick, specifically when processing FPX images.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stack-buffer-underflow in the `OLEProperty::operator=` function within the `libfpx` library, which ImageMagick uses for handling FPX images. This occurs when processing a crafted FPX image. The underflow happens when writing to a stack-allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-buffer-underflow in `OLEProperty::operator=(tagFILETIME const&)`. This occurs when an attempt is made to write data before the beginning of a stack-allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The stack-buffer-underflow can lead to a crash (as seen in the ASAN output) and potentially allow for further exploitation to achieve arbitrary code execution if the underflow corrupts critical parts of the stack.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the processing of a specially crafted FPX image. In this case, the user provides a malicious `not_kitty.bmp` input, that is converted to `not_kitty.FPX` causing the underflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted FPX image to be processed by ImageMagick.
- The attacker does not require any specific privileges as the vulnerability is triggered when a regular user uses `convert` utility provided by ImageMagick.

This report provides more details than the typical CVE description which would simply state a stack-buffer-underflow vulnerability exists. It provides the exact location, the input file to trigger it, and the stack trace.
