## Installation

#### Minimum Requirements

* WordPress 5.6 or greater
* PHP version 7.4 or greater
* MySQL version 5.7 or greater, OR MariaDB version 10.3 or greater.

#### Automatic installation

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Property Hive, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “Property Hive” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

#### Manual installation

The manual installation method involves downloading the Property Hive plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

#### Updating

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

## FAQ

### How do I install Property Hive?

Click the download button above or from within WordPress navigate to Plugins > Add New and search for ‘Property Hive’.

### Does the free core plugin contain everything I need to create a working property website?

Yes. It is possible to create a property website out of the box with Property Hive. You can also use our free Honeycomb theme, which compliments the plugin well.

### What kind of properties can I store?

Using the Property Hive plugin you can store and manage sales, lettings/rentals and commercial properties. You can also add additional departments such as student lets, new homes, farms and land etc.

### Can I import my properties with Property Hive?

With a [Property Hive Pro](https://wp-property-hive.com/pricing/?src=wordpress&link=b) subscription you can automatically import properties from all leading CRMs such as Alto, Street, Loop, Reapit, 10Ninety, SME Professional, dezrez, Kyero, agentOS, Juvo, Jupix, Arthur Online, VaultEA, Kato and more.

### Does Property Hive work with other themes?

You can use Property Hive with any standard non real estate theme. We also have a free theme of our own, Honeycomb. (https://wp-property-hive.com/theme-options/honeycomb/)

### Does Property Hive work with other plugins?

Property Hive is compatible with almost all other plugins. As long as the other plugins you are using don’t cause a conflict (for example they also add property search) then there shouldn’t be an issue. Contact us if you have questions on this.

### Where are you based?

We are based in the UK.

### I list properties that are not in the UK. Can I use this plugin?

Yes you can. Property Hive has a range of international options including the option to select which countries you operate in. We also support multiple currencies and store live currency exchange rates to aid with sorting and filtering properties in multiple currencies.

### Is Property Hive compatible with page builders such as Elementor and Divi?

Yes, you can use Elementor to build property details and search results pages. You can use Divi to build a property details page. Support for other page builders is coming!

### Do I need to know how to code to use Property Hive?

No, you have a few options for styling property pages:

* Use our free Honeycomb theme where everything comes styled by default. Simply add your logo and brand colours.
* Use any theme and use a page builder such as Elementor to build property pages by dropping in widgets that come with the page builder.
* With some HTML, CSS and/or PHP knowledge you can go completely bespoke and override the templates.

### Is Property Hive safe and secure?

Property Hive has been running since 2015 and since then has undergone multiple security reviews.

All input and output is validated and sanitised and to this date, we have not had one report of a site being compromised as a result of Property Hive.

Any issues surrounding security are taken seriously and addressed as a matter of priority.

### What’s the difference between the free core plugin and Property Hive Pro?

The free core plugin contains the foundations that you need to create a property website. With the free version you can also access a suite of front and back end tools and fully functioning Property Hive CRM (or use your own).

[Property Hive Pro](https://wp-property-hive.com/pricing/?src=wordpress&link=c) contains a wider suite of tools that enhance the core plugin. This includes a CRM import tool, portal feeds and much more.

First off – this is not intended to be a wholly negative post. It’s clear that the plugin is EXCEPTIONALLY powerful… however, during testing of the plugin I came across three areas which IMHO should be addressed. My hope was to speed up my workflow when creating property listing sites, as ATM we build from the ground up using ACF. However…1) Clucky documentation … it takes a while to search the docs to find how to’s or why something is not working as expected. overall, on-site documentation in parts can be so sparse, we had to revert to Facebook groups or Reddit to find the answers we needed.2) Page builder centric … We predominantly use either the Kadence or Blocksy Pro themes, alongside Guttenberg blocks including block plugins from Kadence, Stackable etc. But its seems to be able to create something truly unique (visually) you have to use either Divi, Elementor or Bricks. While we do have a Elemento Pro licence, we have not built a new site with it since 2022, and we’re actively pushing what remaining clients we have using Elementor over to Block-based designs, hopefully by the end of 2025. We could create our own theme and script our own dynamic blocks, but that defeats the point of switching to speed up our workflow.3) Could not get Google maps API to work. I’m sure it’s a problem at our end, but we could not figure out what was going wrong, and searching the docs (point 1) became a PITA. It frustrates as we can connect using ACF or the Easy Property Listings plugin we’ve tested side by side. Overall, we could live with point 1, most plugins/themes are poorly documented (Kadence)… but to not natively support blocks or even the WP code dynamic block is truly disheartening, for such a powerful feature rich plugin…As it stands, we can recreate most of the features Hive offers with ACF/SCF and some customisations. But it take use approx 200 man hours…. This could have cut that down to 10 to 30 man hours.Hopefully, Hive will address the lack of block support in the future. Or have a solution for using the dynamic block, that we have missed.

Very powerful plugin for creating real estate / property listing websites.
Works as a complete solution out the box but very customisable and endless dev docs on their site and resources on their github.
Our project was built using Elementor and the integration works great, giving us full creative freedom backed by the tools Property Hive includes. No other solution could have worked for our project, really good investment and we aren’t even utilising all the plugin has to offer!
Support has been nothing short of perfect, huge thank you to Steve & the team. Provided great solutions, helped with bug fixes and even sent code snippets over when my talent ran out.
I’ve never experience support as good before, and doubt I will again.
Thanks again

This plugin works so well. It was a breeze to set up and get running (took less than 1/2 a day to get everything set up just like I wanted). I’ve been using this solution for over 3 years. In that time, we’ve had one issue crop up which the development team worked quickly to resolve.

We’ve been using PropertyHive to migrate a website from Rex Software to Street. The overall developer experience was amazing. Lot of stuff that worked out of the box, and it’s quite easy to create your own custom functionalities by using the hooks.
Would definitely recommend this plugin. The support is excellent too.

I’ve used various plugins to streamline property management processes. However, nothing quite compares to the unparalleled excellence of Property Hive. From the moment I integrated it into my WordPress site, I was blown away by its extensive features and intuitive interface.
One of the standout qualities of Property Hive is its robust functionality. Whether it’s effortlessly creating and managing property listings or seamlessly handling inquiries and appointments, this plugin exceeds expectations at every turn. Its flexibility and customization options have allowed me to tailor the platform to suit my specific needs, ensuring a seamless and personalised experience.
But what also truly sets Property Hive apart is its exceptional support. In my years of working with various plugins, I’ve never encountered support as responsive, knowledgeable, and dedicated as Steve behind Property Hive. Above and beyond to address any queries or concerns promptly from Day 1, offering insightful solutions and guidance every step of the way. His commitment to customer satisfaction is truly commendable and has made all the difference.
Property Hive’s continuous updates and improvements demonstrate a commitment to staying ahead of the curve in an ever-evolving industry. With each new feature and enhancement, it becomes increasingly clear that Property Hive is not just a plugin but a dynamic tool that grows and evolves alongside its users. Look at the changelog for yourself, and it’s obvious how much detail, thought and incredible work has gone into Property Hive.
In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend Property Hive to any property professional looking to streamline their operations and elevate their business to new heights. With its unparalleled functionality, customisable features, and exceptional support, Property Hive is going to an indispensable asset in my arsenal, and I have no doubt it will do the same for anyone who chooses to harness its power.Thank you!

Brilliant plugin that is consistently being developed. We recently built a site using Bricks Builder, and I recently reached out to PropertyHive to see if they would consider an integration, and they said yes! They built the integration and now we can built Property Pages directly through Bricks. The team have worked with us to fix bugs and add additional functionalties. I can’t thank Steve enough for their support.
