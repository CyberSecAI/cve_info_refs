Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-6335:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from how Proxygen, a library used by HHVM for handling HTTP/2 requests, parses HTTP/2 header padding. Specifically, a malformed HTTP/2 frame with incorrect padding length can trigger an `std::out_of_range` exception when parsing priority metadata.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Improper Input Validation:** The code does not adequately validate the padding length specified in an HTTP/2 frame against the actual frame length. Specifically, the code calculates `header.length - padding` without ensuring that padding is less than or equal to header.length.
- **Out-of-bounds access**: By using the incorrect padding length calculation, the code attempts to access an index outside the valid bounds of an array or data structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The `std::out_of_range` exception leads to a crash in the HHVM service, causing a denial-of-service condition. The service becomes unavailable until it is restarted.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted HTTP/2 request to a vulnerable HHVM server.
- **Malformed HTTP/2 Frame:** The attack involves crafting an HTTP/2 frame with a padding length that exceeds the actual frame length.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable server.
- **HTTP/2 knowledge**: The attacker needs a basic understanding of the HTTP/2 protocol.
- **No Authentication Required:** No special authentication or privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability is located in the `HTTP2Framer.cpp` file within the Proxygen library used by HHVM.
- The fix involves adding a check to ensure that the padding length is not greater than the frame length before subtracting it.
- The commit `4cb57dd753a339654ca464c139db9871fe961d56` contains the patch.
- The vulnerability affects HHVM versions 3.25.2, 3.24.6, 3.21.10 and below when using the proxygen server to handle HTTP2 requests.

**Additional Notes:**
- The GitHub Advisory database entry for this CVE provides a CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 and categorizes it as High Severity.
- The fix is included in HHVM versions 3.25.3, 3.24.7, and 3.21.11.
