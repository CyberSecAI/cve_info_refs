Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6116:

**CVE Description:**

The provided information indicates this CVE is related to "Incorrect low memory handling in WebAssembly" within the Chromium browser.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause lies in how the WebAssembly component of the Chromium browser handles low memory conditions. The specific nature of this incorrect handling is not fully detailed but implies a flaw in resource management during low-memory situations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Low Memory Handling:** The primary weakness is the flawed logic in the WebAssembly implementation that fails to properly manage memory constraints, potentially leading to exploitable conditions when the system is low on memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   While the direct impact isn't clearly defined in the text, the "incorrect low memory handling" could result in a variety of issues, including:
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By triggering this flaw repeatedly, an attacker could force a crash of the browser by exhausting memory resources.
    *   **Unspecified Other Effects:**  Given the nature of memory corruption issues, it could potentially lead to other forms of unexpected behavior within the browser.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **WebAssembly Execution:** The attack vector would involve a malicious website or application that executes crafted WebAssembly code within the Chromium browser. This code would need to be designed to trigger the low-memory condition and thus exploit the flawed memory handling.
*   **Remote Attack:** Since WebAssembly is typically executed within the context of a web page, this flaw could be exploited remotely by enticing a user to visit a malicious page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Code Delivery:** The attacker needs the ability to deliver malicious WebAssembly code to a vulnerable browser, commonly through a website.
*   **Understanding of WebAssembly:** Exploitation likely requires knowledge of how the WebAssembly implementation within Chromium operates, specifically how it allocates memory.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability doesn't require any special authentication, so any user who visits a malicious web page can be affected.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Low Severity:** Both Red Hat and the upstream Chromium project classified this as a Low severity issue. This might suggest that the specific exploit is challenging or the direct consequences are not critical.

* **Fix:** The vulnerability was fixed in chromium version 66.0.3359.117

In summary, CVE-2018-6116 involves a vulnerability in Chromium's WebAssembly implementation related to handling low memory situations. An attacker could exploit this by providing malicious WebAssembly code, potentially leading to denial of service or other undefined issues.
