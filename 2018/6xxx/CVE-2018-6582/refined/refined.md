Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-6582

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The Joomla! Component Zh GoogleMap version 8.4.0.0 is vulnerable to SQL Injection. The vulnerability lies in the `id` parameter of several functions within the `controller.php` file: `getPlacemarkDetails`, `getPlacemarkHoverText`, `getPathHoverText`, and `getPathDetails`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `id` parameter, before using it in SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the underlying database. This could lead to:
   - Data exfiltration (reading sensitive data)
   - Data manipulation (modifying or deleting data)
   - Potential complete compromise of the database server if the database user has sufficient privileges
   - Possibly compromising the web server if the database user has sufficient privileges or through chained exploits.

**Attack Vectors:**
   - The attack vector is through HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable functions of the `com_zhgooglemap` component.
   - Specifically, the `id` parameter within the POST data is used as the injection point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the web application.
   - The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit this vulnerability

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit demonstrates four different injection points in the following functions, within the `controller.php` file
  - `getPlacemarkDetails` (Line 30)
  - `getPlacemarkHoverText` (Line 363)
  - `getPathHoverText` (Line 418)
  - `getPathDetails` (Line 763)
- Each injection point uses a variation of `UNION ALL SELECT` to extract table names from the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`.
