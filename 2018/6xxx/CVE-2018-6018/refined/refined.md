The provided content discusses a vulnerability in the Tinder mobile application, as discovered by Checkmarx. This vulnerability is related to the lack of proper encryption, and it matches the description for CVE-2018-6018.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper HTTPS encryption for photos transmitted through the Tinder mobile app, and insufficient padding of other encrypted data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
1.  **Lack of HTTPS encryption for photos:** Tinder was not using HTTPS encryption for photos, allowing an attacker on the same Wi-Fi network to intercept and view any images a user was viewing or sending.
2.  **Information leakage from encrypted commands:** While other data was encrypted using HTTPS, the encrypted commands still leaked enough information (such as size/length) for an attacker to differentiate between them, thereby revealing the user's actions within the app (swiping left/right, matching, etc.)
 
**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privacy violation:** Attackers could see the photos a user is viewing, and intercept and view their swipes and matches, providing a lot of information about their dating preferences.
- **Image injection:** The lack of encryption also enabled attackers to inject their own images into the victim's photo stream.
- **Voyeurism:** Attackers could monitor a victimâ€™s Tinder activity for personal gratification.
- **Blackmail:** The information obtained from this vulnerability could be used for blackmail.
- **Reconstruction of user's activity:** Attackers could reconstruct a target's entire session within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Same Wi-Fi Network:** The attack vector is a shared Wi-Fi network. The attacker must be on the same Wi-Fi network as the target.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same Wi-Fi network as the Tinder user they intend to target.
- The attacker needs the ability to monitor network traffic on that Wi-Fi network.
- The attacker needs software to analyze the network traffic and to interpret the Tinder app data, which was made publicly available by Checkmarx.

The article provides more technical detail than the official CVE description by explaining the specifics of the vulnerabilities (lack of photo encryption and information leakage from command sizes).
