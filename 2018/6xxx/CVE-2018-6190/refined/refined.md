Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6190:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data within the Netis WF2419 router's web interface. Specifically, HTML code injected into the MAC filter description field is not properly escaped, leading to an HTML injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **HTML Injection:** The primary vulnerability is HTML injection which can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML or script code into the context of the router's web interface.
*   This can lead to:
    *   Stealing cookie-based authentication credentials.
    *   Manipulating how the site is rendered to the user.
    *   Potentially other attacks as the injected code can execute within the user's browser context.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the web interface of the Netis WF2419 router.
*   Specifically, an attacker must navigate to the "Wireless Settings" and then the "MAC Filtering" tab.
*   The attacker then inputs malicious HTML/script code into the "Description" field while adding a new MAC filter entry.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to access the web interface of the Netis WF2419 router, typically on the local network. This could be from a machine on the local network or through an exposed interface depending on the router's configuration.
*  They must have the ability to navigate to the MAC filtering section of the router's configuration.
