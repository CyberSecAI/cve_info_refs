- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the Brocade Fabric OS command line interface (CLI). Specifically, the `supportsave` command is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The `supportsave` command in the Fabric OS CLI allows a local attacker to escape the restricted shell.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to gain root access.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by a local attacker who has access to the restricted CLI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have local access to the restricted shell of the Brocade Fabric OS.
