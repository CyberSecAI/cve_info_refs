Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update for Desktop](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2018/07/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html "Stable Channel Update for Desktop")

Tuesday, July 24, 2018

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 68 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux. This will roll out over the coming days/weeks.

Chrome 68.0.3440.75 contains a number of fixes and improvements -- a list of changes is available in the[log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/67.0.3396.99..68.0.3440.75?pretty=fuller&n=10000). Watch out for upcoming[Chrome](https://chrome.blogspot.com/) and[Chromium](https://blog.chromium.org/) blog posts about new features and big efforts delivered in 68.

**HTTP Sites Marked as "Not Secure"**
In Chrome 68, Chrome will show the “Not secure” warning on all HTTP pages. We announced this in a [blog post](https://security.googleblog.com/2018/02/a-secure-web-is-here-to-stay.html) published on February 8th on Google’s Chromium and Online Security blogs.

To ensure that the Not Secure warning is not displayed for your pages in Chrome 68, we recommend migrating your site to HTTPS. The following [migration guide](//goo.gl/jKrUKt) provides migration recommendations and addresses common migration concerns such as SEO, ad revenue and performance impact.

**Security Fixes and Rewards**
*Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.*

This update includes [42](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M68&colspec=ID+Pri+M+Stars+ReleaseBlock+Component+Status+Owner+Summary+OS+Modified&x=m&y=releaseblock&cells=ids) security fixes. Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chrome Security Page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

[[866821](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=866821)] Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives

The following bugs were fixed in previous Chrome releases, but were mistakenly omitted from the release notes at the time:

[$1000][[812667](https://crbug.com/812667)] Medium CVE-2018-6150: Cross origin information disclosure in Service Workers. *Reported by Rob Wu on 2018-02-15*

[$500][[805905](https://crbug.com/805905)] Medium CVE-2018-6151: Bad cast in DevTools. *Reported by Rob Wu on 2018-01-25*

[$2000][[805445](https://crbug.com/805445)] Medium CVE-2018-6152: Local file write in DevTools. *Reported by Rob Wu on 2018-01-24*

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer](https://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/undefinedbehaviorsanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity), [libFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer), or [AFL](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/).
