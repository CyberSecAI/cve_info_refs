- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Multiple vulnerabilities in the Brocade Fabric OS command-line interface (CLI) allow a local attacker to escape the restricted shell. Specifically, the `configdownload` command is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of the `configdownload` command within the restricted CLI, enabling a shell escape.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to gain root access to the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is local, requiring an attacker to have some level of access to the system's CLI. The specific vector is through the `configdownload` command.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be local and have access to the restricted CLI of the Brocade Fabric OS.
