Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6912:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from out-of-bounds read issues within the `utvideodec` component of FFmpeg. Specifically, the commit message states "avcodec/utvideodec: Add several out of array read related checks". This indicates that the vulnerability lies in how the utvideo decoder handles certain input, leading to attempts to read data from memory locations outside of allocated buffers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Out-of-bounds read:** The core issue is an out-of-bounds read, where the software attempts to access memory locations beyond the boundaries of an allocated array. This can lead to unexpected program behavior, information disclosure, and potentially crashes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** While not explicitly stated in the commit message, the Gentoo security advisory mentions that this vulnerability can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS). An out-of-bounds read can cause the program to crash, rendering the service unavailable.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (potentially):** The Gentoo advisory also indicates the possibility of arbitrary code execution, although not explicitly stated as a direct outcome from the commit message or code fix. Out-of-bounds reads can sometimes be leveraged for more severe exploits by malicious actors.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Maliciously crafted input:** The attack vector is a specially crafted file that, when processed by FFmpeg, triggers the out-of-bounds read within the `utvideodec` module.
- **Remote or Local:** The Gentoo advisory mentions that the vulnerability is "local, remote" exploitable. This means that an attacker can trigger this issue either by providing a local file to be processed, or by inducing a user or automated system to process a crafted file via network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must be able to provide input to an FFmpeg instance (local or remote), specifically a malformed input that triggers the vulnerable code path within `utvideodec`.
- No special privileges seem to be necessary.

**Additional Notes:**
- The git commit message includes "Fixes: OV_decode_plane.avi" which gives an example file that can trigger the vulnerability
- The commit message also credits GwanYeong Kim for discovering the vulnerability.
- The fix in the git commit specifically adds checks to prevent out of array reads.
- Gentoo lists this CVE as part of a larger advisory, indicating that multiple vulnerabilities were patched in the same FFmpeg update.
