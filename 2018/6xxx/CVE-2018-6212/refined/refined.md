    "summary": "A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the \"Quick Search\" admin panel field of D-Link DIR-620 routers. This allows attackers to inject malicious scripts that will be reflected back to users.",
    "details": [
      {
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The router's web interface does not properly sanitize user input in the 'Quick Search' field of the admin panel, leading to a reflected XSS vulnerability.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Malicious JavaScript code can be injected via the 'Quick Search' field.",
         "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser when the user interacts with the malicious input. This can lead to session hijacking, credential theft, or other client-side attacks.",
        "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the 'Quick Search' field in the router's administrative web interface. An attacker would craft a malicious URL with embedded JavaScript and trick a user into accessing the URL.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to entice a legitimate user into clicking on a malicious link containing the crafted XSS payload. No special privileges on the device are needed."
