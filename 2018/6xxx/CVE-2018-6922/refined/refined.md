{
  "ID": "CVE-2018-6922",
  "Summary": "A remote attacker with the ability to send TCP traffic to an affected system could cause a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.",
  "Root cause": "An inefficient algorithm is used to reassemble TCP segments in FreeBSD versions 11, 11.1, 11.2, 10, and 10.4.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Inefficient algorithm for TCP segment reassembly."
  ],
  "Impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow a remote attacker cause Denial of Service (DoS).  An attacker who has the ability to send TCP traffic to a victim system can degrade the victim system's network performance and/or consume excessive CPU with relatively small bandwidth cost.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "A remote attacker with the ability to send TCP traffic to an affected system."
  ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
    "Ability to send TCP traffic to the target system."
  ],

  "Remediation": "Patches are available for affected ONTAP versions. The patches limit the size of each TCP connection's reassembly queue. The value is controlled by a sysctl (net.inet.tcp.reass.maxqueuelen), which sets the maximum number of TCP segments that can be outstanding on a session's reassembly queue. This value defaults to 100."
