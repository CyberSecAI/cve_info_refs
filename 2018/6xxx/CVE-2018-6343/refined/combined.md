## Description

Proxygen fails to validate that a secondary auth manager is set before dereferencing it. That can cause a denial of service issue when parsing a Certificate/CertificateRequest HTTP2 Frame over a fizz (TLS 1.3) transport. This issue affects Proxygen releases starting from v2018.10.29.00 until the fix in v2018.11.19.00.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
