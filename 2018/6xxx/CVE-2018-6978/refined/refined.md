- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper permissions on support scripts within vRealize Operations (vROps)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Local privilege escalation vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An admin user (non-sudoer) with shell access to the vROps application can escalate their privileges to root on the vROps machine.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs shell access to the vROps machine as an admin user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have an account on the vROps system with admin privileges and have shell access.
