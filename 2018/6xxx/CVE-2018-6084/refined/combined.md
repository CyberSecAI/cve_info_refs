**Vulnerable App:**

```
/*
Google software updater ships with Chrome on MacOS and installs a root service (com.google.Keystone.Daemon.UpdateEngine)
which lives here: /Library/Google/GoogleSoftwareUpdate/GoogleSoftwareUpdate.bundle/Contents/MacOS/GoogleSoftwareUpdateDaemon

This service vends a Distributed Object which exposes an API for updating google software running on the machine.

Distributed Objects are very very hard to safely use across a privileged boundary.

The GoogleSoftwareUpdateDaemon process attempts to "sanitize" objects passed to it by serializing
and deserializing them to a plist, however this still means we can attack the plist serializing code!

Specifically, with D.O. we can pass proxy objects which allow us to overload all objective-c
method calls. We can make the plist code think it's serializing a CFString, and then change our behaviour
to return a different CFTypeID so we become a dictionary for example.

The plist serialization code is not written to defend against such proxy objects, because D.O. should not be
used across a privilege boundary.

In this case I'm targetting the following code in CoreFoundation:

static void _flattenPlist(CFPropertyListRef plist, CFMutableArrayRef objlist, CFMutableDictionaryRef objtable, CFMutableSetRef uniquingset);

plist will be a proxy for the FakeCFObject I define. We can first pretend to be a CFString to pass some other type checks, then become a CFDictionary
(by simply returning a different return value for the _cfTypeID method.) We can then reach the following code:

    CFIndex count = CFDictionaryGetCount((CFDictionaryRef)plist);
    STACK_BUFFER_DECL(CFPropertyListRef, buffer, count <= 128 ? count * 2 : 1);
    CFPropertyListRef *list = (count <= 128) ? buffer : (CFPropertyListRef *)CFAllocatorAllocate(kCFAllocatorSystemDefault, 2 * count * sizeof(CFTypeRef), __kCFAllocatorGCScannedMemory);
    CFDictionaryGetKeysAndValues((CFDictionaryRef)plist, list, list + count);
    for (CFIndex idx = 0; idx < 2 * count; idx++) {
      _flattenPlist(list[idx], objlist, objtable, uniquingset);
    }

Since we're not a real CFDictionary we can return an arbitrary value for count. If we return a value < 0 it will be used to calculate the size of a stack buffer.
By passing a carefully chosen value this lets you move the stack pointer down an arbitrary amount, off the bottom of the stack and potentially into another thread's stack
or on to the heap, allowing memory corruption.

There will be dozens of other places where attack-controlled proxy objects will be able to interact with system code that was not written expecting to have
to deal with proxy objects.

The correct fix is to not use Distributed Objects across a privilege boundary, as per Apple's advice:
https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/DesigningDaemons.html

build this PoC:
clang -o ks ks.m -framework Foundation -framework CoreFoundation

start lldb waiting for the daemon to start:
sudo lldb --wait-for -n "/Library/Google/GoogleSoftwareUpdate/GoogleSoftwareUpdate.bundle/Contents/MacOS/GoogleSoftwareUpdateDaemon"

continue lldb and run the poc, you should see that the stack ends up pointing well outside the stack :)

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update for Desktop](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2018/04/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html "Stable Channel Update for Desktop")

Tuesday, April 17, 2018

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 66 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux. This will roll out over the coming days/weeks.

Chrome 66.0.3359.117 contains a number of fixes and improvements -- a list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/65.0.3325.181..66.0.3359.117?pretty=fuller&n=10000). Watch out for upcoming[Chrome](https://chrome.blogspot.com/) and[Chromium](https://blog.chromium.org/) blog posts about new features and big efforts delivered in 66.

**Site Isolation Trial**
Chrome 66 will include a small percentage trial of [Site Isolation](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/site-isolation), to prepare for a broader upcoming launch.  Site Isolation improves Chrome's security and [helps mitigate the risks posed by Spectre](https://security.googleblog.com/2018/01/todays-cpu-vulnerability-what-you-need.html).

To diagnose whether an issue is caused by Site Isolation, use chrome://flags#site-isolation-trial-opt-out as described [here](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/site-isolation#TOC-Diagnosing-Issues). Please [report](https://goo.gl/XBoKtY) any trial-specific issues to help us fix them before Site Isolation is launched more broadly.

**Security Fixes and Rewards**

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

Chrome 66 will not trust website certificates issued by Symantec's legacy PKI before June 1st 2016, continuing the phased distrust outlined in our [previous announcements](https://security.googleblog.com/2018/03/distrust-of-symantec-pki-immediate.html).

This update includes [62](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+os%3DAndroid%2Cios%2Clinux%2Cmac%2Cwindows%2Call+label%3ARelease-0-M66) security fixes. Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chrome Security Page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.
As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[833889](https://crbug.com/833889)] Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer](https://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/undefinedbehaviorsanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity), [libFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer), or [AFL](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/).
