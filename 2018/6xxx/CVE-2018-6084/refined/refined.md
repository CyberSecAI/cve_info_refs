CVE-2018-6084
```
**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Google Software Updater daemon on macOS uses Distributed Objects (D.O.) across a privilege boundary, which is unsafe. The daemon attempts to sanitize objects passed to it by serializing and deserializing them to a plist, but this does not prevent attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unsafe use of Distributed Objects across a privilege boundary.
- The plist serialization code does not defend against proxy objects that can overload Objective-C method calls, leading to type confusion.
- The code uses a stack buffer whose size is calculated based on a value controlled by the attacker. This can be manipulated to cause a stack overflow by providing a negative value.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Local privilege escalation, leading to arbitrary code execution with root privileges.
- By manipulating the stack pointer, an attacker can cause memory corruption, potentially overwriting data or code in other threads or the heap.
- The exploit can execute arbitrary shell scripts as root.

**Attack vectors:**
- A local attacker can connect to the Google Software Updater daemon's exposed Distributed Object.
- The attacker crafts a malicious proxy object that, when serialized to a plist, causes a stack buffer overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs local access to a macOS system where Google Chrome and the Google Software Updater are installed.
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the exposed Distributed Object of the GoogleSoftwareUpdateDaemon.
- No special privileges are required before exploitation.
