  "CVE-2018-6126": {
    "description": "A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in the Skia component of the Chromium browser. When Skia fills a path with antialiasing turned off, SkScan::FillPath gets called. SkScan::FillPath first checks that the path fits in the current drawing area (Clip). If the clipping test passes at this point, then no other clipping checks will be performed when drawing this path. However, due to precision errors, it is possible that the drawing algorith is going to end up drawing outside of the current drawing area, which results in a heap overflow. In this case, the precision errors happens when drawing cubic splines. In SkCubicEdge::setCubicWithoutUpdate, when calculating fCDx, some precision will be lost because C and D end up being shifted to the right. Because of that, it is possible that the fCDx value is going to end up smaller than it should be.",
    "vulnerability": "Heap buffer overflow due to a precision error when drawing cubic splines in Skia library.",
    "impact": "A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web page, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the process or a Denial of Service condition.",
    "attack_vector": "By rendering a specially crafted SVG image with antialiasing turned off via the affected browsers (Chromium, Firefox).",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to entice a user to visit a malicious web page.",
      "root_cause": "Precision errors in calculations within the Skia library, specifically when handling cubic splines, cause incorrect bounds checks leading to a heap buffer overflow during rendering of paths with antialiasing turned off."
