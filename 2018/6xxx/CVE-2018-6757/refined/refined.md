Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2018-6757:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The primary vulnerability stems from the improper implementation of the `SecureExecuteCommand::Execute` method within the McAfee True Key service. Specifically, the method attempts to verify the signature of an executable before executing it, but the verification process is flawed. Additionally, there are TOCTOU race conditions and a cleanup command issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Incorrect Signature Verification:** The `CheckCertificates` method extracts the X509 certificate from the security data directory of a file, but it doesn't verify the signature itself, allowing an attacker to apply the security data directory from a valid signed file to any arbitrary file.
2.  **TOCTOU Vulnerabilities:** The `SecureExecuteCommand::Execute` method suffers from Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race conditions. The method opens the file multiple times to perform checks, which creates a window where an attacker can use symlinks (mount points) to change the target file before it gets executed.
3.  **Insecure CleanupCommand:** The CleanupCommand deletes values from the shared location `C:\ProgramData\McAfee\TrueKey` without proper access control, which can be manipulated using symlinks for arbitrary file deletion.
4.  **PID Verification Issues:** The service looks up the PID based on a TCP port provided by the client, which allows a malicious client to pass in its own port and trick the service into verifying itself.
5.  **Process Path Spoofing:** The method for retrieving the process path of the calling process is vulnerable to spoofing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges due to the insecure signature check and TOCTOU vulnerabilities in `SecureExecuteCommand::Execute`.
*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** Attackers can delete any file on the system due to insecure cleanup command using symbolic links.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker requires local access to the machine where the McAfee True Key service is running.
*   **RPC calls:** The vulnerabilities can be triggered via RPC calls to the vulnerable service method.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the system.
*   **Ability to interact with the McAfee True Key service:** The attacker needs to be able to send commands to the vulnerable service method using RPC.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable service method and its parameters.**
*   **Ability to create and manipulate symbolic links (mount points):** to exploit the TOCTOU vulnerability and cleanup command.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating the exploitation of the signature verification flaw.
*   The content mentions that DLL planting and other issues could be fixed by moving the executable to a secure location and performing correct verification before execution.
*   The service uses `Process::MainModule::FileName` which extracts the path from the process memory, making it easy to spoof.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Google Security Research.
*   The vulnerable application is McAfee True Key version 5.1.173.1 running on Windows 10 1809.
