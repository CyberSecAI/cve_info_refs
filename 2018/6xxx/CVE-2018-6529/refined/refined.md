The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in D-Link DIR-880L/865L/868L/860L routers, including XSS and command injection. CVE-2018-6529 is one of the XSS vulnerabilities mentioned.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of input validation in the router's web interface, specifically within the PHP files and javascript files. This allows for malicious code to be injected via HTTP GET parameters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are present in the following files:
    - `/htdocs/webinc/body/bsc_sms_send.php`
    - `/htdocs/webinc/js/adv_parent_ctrl_map.php`
    - `/htdocs/webinc/js/bsc_sms_inbox.php`

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can exploit these XSS vulnerabilities to steal authentication cookies from logged-in users. This could lead to full control of the router by using the stolen credentials.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through crafted URLs that include malicious JavaScript code within the GET parameters.
- Victims can be lured to open these malicious URLs while logged into the router's web interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to convince a logged-in user to click on a malicious link that contains the exploit.
- No special network access is required as this can be done from the LAN/WAN side.
