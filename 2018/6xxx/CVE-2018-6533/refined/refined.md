Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6533:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stemmed from the way Icinga 2 handled user and group settings for its runtime directories and files.  Specifically, the `init.conf` file was used to determine the user and group under which Icinga 2 would run. This file could be modified by an attacker and allow the service to run as root.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Configuration:** Relying on a user-modifiable `init.conf` file to set the user/group for processes that require root privileges creates an opportunity for privilege escalation.
*   **Missing Input Validation:** The init script did not properly validate or sanitize the user and group information read from `init.conf`.
*   **Incorrect directory/file creation:** The script created directories and files with incorrect permissions and ownership, which could also lead to privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution as Root:** By modifying the `init.conf` file, an attacker could force Icinga 2 to execute with root privileges. This would allow the attacker to run arbitrary code on the system as the root user, leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A user with limited privileges could escalate to root access by exploiting this vulnerability.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Full access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local File Modification:** An attacker with write access to the `init.conf` file could exploit this vulnerability. This could be achieved through other vulnerabilities or by compromising user accounts that have access to modify the file.
*   **Configuration Manipulation:** By changing the user and group settings in `init.conf`, an attacker could trick the init scripts into running Icinga 2 as root.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Write Access:** The attacker would need write access to the `init.conf` file, located somewhere on the filesystem.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker would need to be able to access the system locally in order to make changes to the configuration files and/or execute arbitrary code.
*   **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker would need a basic understanding of Linux file permissions and init scripts.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involved removing the reliance on `init.conf` for determining user and group settings for the Icinga 2 process.
*   The vulnerability is related to but distinct from CVE-2017-16933, which also involved privilege escalation issues in Icinga 2.
*   The issue was resolved in Icinga 2 version 2.8.2.

The provided content also shows the discussion of how the fix was implemented. This includes using `dirname` to determine the log directory, handling cases where the configuration might be missing, and using `install` command rather than `mkdir` in order to set directory owner and permissions in a safe way. It also includes an attempt to use `su` to execute commands as the configured Icinga user, but that did not work because the user does not have a shell.

The content contains several discussions and code snippets demonstrating the vulnerability and the process of fixing it.
