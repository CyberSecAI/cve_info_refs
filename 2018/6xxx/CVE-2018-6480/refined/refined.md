The provided content relates to CVE-2018-6480.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a type confusion in the `ccnl_fwd_handleInterest` function within the ccn-lite library. The function incorrectly assumes that the union member `s` of a packet is always of type `ccnl_pktdetail_ndntlv_s`. However, it could also be of type `struct ccnl_pktdetail_ccntlv_s` or `struct ccnl_pktdetail_iottlv_s`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Type confusion: The code accesses the `nonce` member of the `ndntlv` structure without properly checking the actual type of the packet detail structure.
- Use of potentially uninitialized memory: If the packet detail structure is not of type `ccnl_pktdetail_ndntlv_s`, the accessed memory could be uninitialized or point to unrelated data, leading to incorrect values for the `nonce` variable.
- Incorrect nonce processing: The `ccnl_nonce_isDup` function may compare an invalid `nonce` value with entries in the Pending Interest Table (PIT) due to the type confusion.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The use of an incorrect nonce value could lead to unpredictable behavior and incorrect processing of interest packets.
- It may cause denial-of-service by repeatedly processing the same interest packet.
- It is possible that a crafted packet could trigger the vulnerability and lead to a crash by attempting to read out of bounds or utilize invalid memory.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could send crafted interest packets with different packet detail types (ccntlv or iottlv), to trigger the type confusion vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must be able to send packets to a system using the vulnerable ccn-lite library. No special privileges are required beyond network access.
