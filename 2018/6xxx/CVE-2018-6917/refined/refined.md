- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient validation of user-provided font parameters in the `vt(4)` driver leads to an integer overflow. This overflow results in arbitrary kernel memory being used as glyph data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Integer overflow leading to out-of-bounds read in kernel memory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unprivileged users can access privileged kernel data by displaying characters that reference the attacker-controlled memory. This disclosed data can include sensitive information such as portions of the file cache or terminal buffers, potentially containing passwords or other sensitive information, and can be used to further elevate privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** Loading a crafted font via the `vt(4)` console.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An unprivileged user with access to the system console.
