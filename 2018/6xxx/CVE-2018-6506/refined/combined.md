## MiniBB Forums v3.2.2 ‚Äì Stored¬†XSS

Posted: February 7, 2018 in [OTHER](https://offensivehacking.wordpress.com/category/other/)

Hey Guys,

I have found Stored Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability in MiniBB Forums Software ( v3.2.2)

**Description:**

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted web sites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.

An attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting user. The end user‚Äôs browser has no way to know that the script should not be trusted, and will execute the script. Because it thinks the script came from a trusted source, the malicious script can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site. These scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML page.

**Severity: High**

**POC:**

Steps to reproduce:

1. Login into Administrative Panel of MiniBB application. Click on Add Forum.
2. Enter below XSS payload in supertitle field

Payload: <sVg/oNloAd=alert(‚Äúxss‚Äù)//>

3. Next, click on Add Forum button. The forum gets successfully added.
4. When any user visits the Forums (homepage), our XSS payload gets executed as shown in below screenshot.

Screenshot:

The vulnerability will be patched in next version of MiniBB Forums Software i.e v.3.3
