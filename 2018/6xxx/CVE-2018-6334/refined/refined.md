Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6334:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper handling of multipart file uploads within HHVM. Specifically, the code registers file upload variables directly into the global scope (`$GLOBALS`) instead of using the dedicated `$_FILES` array. This behavior is similar to the deprecated `register_globals` PHP setting, which was known to introduce security issues.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-   **Global Variable Overriding**:  An attacker can use carefully crafted multipart file uploads to overwrite existing global variables or members of the `$GLOBALS` array.
-   **Unintended Variable Registration**: The variables derived from the file upload are registered into the global scope, even if they were not explicitly declared in the script.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unexpected behavior:** Due to the ability to overwrite or introduce global variables, an attacker can manipulate the applicationâ€™s execution flow.
- **Arbitrary code execution:** If an attacker overwrites critical variables, this can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.
-   **Data corruption:** Overwriting global variables might lead to corrupted or inconsistent application state.
-  **Information Disclosure:** Overwriting variables could also expose sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The attacker can send malicious requests via HTTP containing multipart file uploads with specifically crafted field names.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the webserver running HHVM with the vulnerable application.
- No special privileges are required.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided commit diff shows changes to `hphp/runtime/server/upload.cpp` which removes the vulnerable code.
- The hhvm blog post confirms the fix for CVE-2018-6334 and mentions that affected versions are 3.25.1, 3.24.5, and 3.21.9 and below.
- The github advisory database entry confirms the description and the critical severity.
