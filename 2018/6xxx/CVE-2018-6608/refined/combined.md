For me, the more alarming information here is that SOCKS and Tor proxies are also leaking IP addresses. If a SOCKS proxy is configured in browser, isn't it the browser's responsibility to ensure all outgoing traffic - including WebRTC - goes via the proxy? Are these browser bugs? Update: Can confirm Firefox Quantum with SOCKS proxy leaks the address. Oh dear! Update 2: I didn't realize this is how WebRTC actually works. FF even has an entire page for tweaking this stuff <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Media/WebRTC/Privacy>. I hate it when features like these, which atleast in my case go mostly unused, have such critical weaknesses by design and it's not announced anywhere with a big red danger sign. | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  |  | [MichaelGG](user?id=MichaelGG) [on March 28, 2018](item?id=16700855)   | [parent](#16699859) | [next](#16702330) [–]  This is the fault of the browser and WebRTC. They know about this but deliberately break it. The truth is WebRTC should never activate without user permission. But no, WebRTC added data-channels. They have no good use to be silent and especially not to override SOCKS proxy. In fact, some key people on the WebRTC group, when I pressed them, could not provide a single real use-case for silent data channels. Firefox is absolutely in the wrong to ignore your proxy settings, especially without getting consent first to start a call. It's a complete mess. Regardless of what the "spec" says, Firefox is responsible for implementing broken software that harms users. Then again, so is STUN/ICE and basically every single thing that has to do with SIP/VoIP. It's like they go out of their way to be obtuse and come up with shitty standards then take glee in how bad it gets. As an example, look up SIP Torture Tests. There's an RFC just to illustrate the moronic edge-cases in SIP parsing that at one point implies your software needs to be conscious to infer the intention of malformed messages. t. been working in telecom for far too long | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [mirimir](user?id=mirimir) [on March 28, 2018](item?id=16703047)   | [root](#16699859) | [parent](#16700855) | [next](#16700913) [–]  Yes, this is largely the browser's problem. Because all available uplinks are available. Tor browser doesn't leak, because WebRTC is blocked. But other browsers with WebRTC enabled will leak with a standard Tor setup. However, using Whonix for Tor, even if you install a random browser with WebRTC enabled, there is no WebRTC leak. Because the workstation VM has *no Internet access* except through Tor. The gateway VM *is not a router*. There is no forwarding, and it's firewalled. It just exposes Tor ports to a private internal network, for the workstation VM. And one can do the same for VPNs, using pfSense VMs as VPN gateways. Apps in workspace VMs have *no Internet access* except through the VPN client running in the gateway VM. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jerheinze](user?id=jerheinze) [on March 29, 2018](item?id=16705579)   | [root](#16699859) | [parent](#16703047) | [next](#16700913) [–]  +1 for Whonix (with Qubes OS) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [blattimwind](user?id=blattimwind) [on March 28, 2018](item?id=16700913)   | [root](#16699859) | [parent](#16700855) | [prev](#16703047) | [next](#16702416) [–]  TBH just from setting up one (1) PBX with about half a dozen devices from only two manufacturers -- I would never take a job anywhere near anything having something todo with SIP, ever. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Aloha](user?id=Aloha) [on March 28, 2018](item?id=16700958)   | [root](#16699859) | [parent](#16700913) | [next](#16702416) [–]  SIP is one of a few protocols where two completely standard-compliant implementations are commonly unable to interop. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [MichaelGG](user?id=MichaelGG) [on March 28, 2018](item?id=16702593)   | [root](#16699859) | [parent](#16700958) | [next](#16705477) [–]  Oh it gets better. I have implemented SIP software (written, from scratch). On the SIP implementors mailing list, one of the authors defends the insane parsing rules by saying that C and Java allow you to be flexible with syntax, so why not SIP? They are totally detached from actually implementing elegant or high performance software. Actual engineers achieve this despite of SIP's terrible decisions. Granted, many of those are inherited from HTTP. Tell me how many HTTP stacks handle comments and line folding properly... It opens up security holes, too. One proxy interprets \r\r\n as 1 line break, another as 2 line breaks and start of body. Oops, now you can end up sending fun headers to your target because they try to be flexible in accepting input. IIRC there is essentially no way to implement SIP standardly because of so many broken implementations. You have to make some decisions on certain parsing that will break one but any other way will break another. Text-based protocols invite abuse by designers and implementors alike. IETF compounds these by living in a fantasy world. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Aloha](user?id=Aloha) [on March 29, 2018](item?id=16704010)   | [root](#16699859) | [parent](#16702593) | [next](#16705477) [–]  I'm not sure binary protocols are any better, unless you make the first two bytes of every message a version number. FWIW, I consider the canonical implementation of SIP at this point to be asterisk. I work on a SIP derived protocol, P25 CSSI - it has all the issues of SIP, and more! | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [blattimwind](user?id=blattimwind) [on March 29, 2018](item?id=16705462)   | [root](#16699859) | [parent](#16704010) | [next](#16705477) [–]  > I'm not sure binary protocols are any better, unless you make the first two bytes of every message a version number.

The WebRTC team is happy to prompt you to use data channels, but the UX team doesn't want to over saturate people with security warnings. Especially warnings that people wont understand. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [MichaelGG](user?id=MichaelGG) [on March 28, 2018](item?id=16702606)   | [root](#16699859) | [parent](#16702416) | [next](#16701301) [–]  I'm only going off some in-person dealing with folks behind WebRTC and they know that permissions suck and would hurt adoption and hence fight to make sure they don't happen. They dismiss all privacy concerns with "you can't have privacy in a browser" and "fingerprinting will work anyways so we can't make it worse". It's head-in-sand approach to privacy and it's bad. Even then, Firefox is simply wrong to tell people it'll use your proxy, then throw that out. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [lallysingh](user?id=lallysingh) [on March 28, 2018](item?id=16703100)   | [root](#16699859) | [parent](#16702606) | [next](#16701301) [–]  Lots of people in webrtc are critically concerned with the safety and privacy of their users. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [MichaelGG](user?id=MichaelGG) [on March 29, 2018](item?id=16705321)   | [root](#16699859) | [parent](#16703100) | [next](#16704045) [–]  I'm not sure what that means. It was obvious this would be used for fingerprinting and leaks. The explained reasons for proceeding was that permission prompts for data channels would hurt usage, despite not having clear cases where we need P2P without letting users know. And none of this excuses overriding the user's expressed network connectivity. When this was brought up, they immediately jumped to the excuses that fingerprinting can't be helped. And many jumped to saying hey you should use Tor Browser anyway. Total capitulation. Maybe someone cared, but it's not the official stance from webrtc groups or browsers. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [throwaway2048](user?id=throwaway2048) [on March 29, 2018](item?id=16704045)   | [root](#16699859) | [parent](#16703100) | [prev](#16705321) | [next](#16701301) [–]  obviously not that critically concerned if leaking sensitive information like this was required by the spec as drafted, and has remained uncorrected. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [pythonaut\_16](user?id=pythonaut_16) [on March 28, 2018](item?id=16701301)   | [root](#16699859) | [parent](#16700855) | [prev](#16702416) | [next](#16702502) [–]  It really seems like adding a permission handler with a warning on WebRTC would be an easy fix for this problem and/or browsers should respect proxies and such when generating WebRTC candidates.

Most of its actions seem inexplicable and counterproductive when strong privacy and user protection should be their reason to exist and keep a dedicated user base. The bigger problem is exploding complexity in many areas is a huge concern for open source as it's becoming increasingly impossible for small teams to implement or come up with alternatives. This is going to reduce meaningful choice and leave users at the mercy of a mix of corporate or vested interests. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [blattimwind](user?id=blattimwind) [on March 28, 2018](item?id=16700708)   | [parent](#16699859) | [prev](#16704914) | [next](#16700906) [–]  <https://www.privacytools.io/#webrtc> | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [lovelearning](user?id=lovelearning) [on March 29, 2018](item?id=16703900)   | [root](#16699859) | [parent](#16700708) | [next](#16700906) [–]  Thank you for that site.

An easy and foolproof way of using VPNs is with network namespaces. You start the VPN in your init network namespace and then move the created device into a dedicated VPN namespace. OpenVPN has support for this because it allows you to execute a shell script after the VPN device has been created. Then you simply start your browser, torrent client, whatever in this namespace and you are completely safe: 1. If the VPN fails, then the only network device inside the network namespace disappears (modulo the lo device) and the programs in this namespace cannot use the internet. 2. Since the browser can only see the devices within the network namespace, the only IP it can see is the one assigned to you by your VPN provider (usually 10.x.y.z or similar.) DNS leaks can be prevented by using a generic DNS provider such as 8.8.8.8. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [fauigerzigerk](user?id=fauigerzigerk) [on March 28, 2018](item?id=16701147)   | [root](#16699841) | [parent](#16700917) | [next](#16706080) [–]  *>DNS leaks can be prevented by using a generic DNS provider such as 8.8.8.8* You mean leaking to Google doesn't count as leaking?

However, the WebExtensions API allows tweaking this via the webRTCIPHandlingPolicy to only reveal the public "interface" IP address. FWIW, I'm always connected to a VPN and I have configured my macOS [0] and Android [1] firewalls to drop any connection other than the VPN's. 0: Wrote it down here: <https://jomo.tv/security/pf-prevent-traffic-bypassing-vpn> 1: Quite self-explaining: <https://f-droid.org/packages/dev.ukanth.ufirewall/> | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [en4bz](user?id=en4bz) [on March 28, 2018](item?id=16699816)   | [prev](#16703257) | [next](#16701715) [–]  Another thing to watch out for is leaking IPv6 connections.

They're both written in C, but I get extra flexibility by using OpenVPN. Their "TLS is suspect" stance doesn't hold water in my view. 2) When I don't want to set up my own server, OpenVPN allows me to use or even chain lots of third party servers and create my own nested VPN topologies. Installing an OpenVPN client on my phone or tablet takes a few minutes. So, to summarize, Algo would be interesting if it didn't introduce dependency on memory unsafe code or minimized such dependency. But it doesn't. On the client, I do not see why I should trust Apple's IPSEC implementation (racoon?) more than OpenVPN client which is another point they tried to make. As it currently stands, it does not compare favorably to OpenVPN in any way. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [dataflow](user?id=dataflow) [on March 28, 2018](item?id=16699670)   | [parent](#16699532) | [prev](#16699554) | [next](#16700972) [–]  What's so "legacy" about L2TP that it refuses to support it?

But why? You probably have a tens to hundreds of megabit connection that is always on. You have powerful computers that wouldn't even notice a webserver running. Buying a domain costs $8 and pointing it at home is as simple as changing the DNS entry a couple times a year or using DynDNS services. And what you don't have is a need for all the complexity and requirements that most automatically assume they need just because they're drowing in them in their day job. Hosting from home is more than enough for a personal website. It cuts the gordian knot of deciding what types of speech and content will be allowed on any given service. It prevents the perverse incentives of spying and selling users. It allows you to add things to your site on a whim just by copying a file to your web directory or opening an text editor. All the tools of your operating system, this refined and extremely usable software is now just there. Now you don't need a database. No need for a CMS. No need for scaling or containers or 99.9999% uptime. Hosting from home allows you to participate in the 'net in a way that is just natural. When there's not 5 layers of abstraction between you and the web you really can participate and build whatever you want. And since you don't need all that abstraction, dynamic content, and CMS (your OS is the CMS!) the security problems everyone loves to jump on simply vanish. Say you want to monitor your logs, well, you don't need to go install some dynamic language parser and prettifier full of attack surfaces. You just tail the log and grep. You open it in OpenOffice if you really have to have a GUI. You can set alerts as easily as tailing a log. You see day to day the type of bots, people, and referers and how they come to your site all without google analytics. You can respond to people using your site in real time; I love adding personal messages to people *as* they browse my site(s). This is what I mean by participating in the net. Getting down into it. It's a beautiful thing and it solves so many problems that can't even be approached when you're using someone elses computer and someone else's connection.

Cool, and then when I post something to my self-hosted blog that pisses someone off, my home internet gets DDoS'd and I lose my Internet access. It has happened before on IRC. I banned a user because they were spamming racial slurs, and they responded with a DDoS.

It makes it so I can just fill out a single text box and click "Post" and have all the indexes and links on the entire web site update automatically to include that post. I can allow people to write comments. I can create the ability for users of my site to search it. And maximum uptime is still important. My home internet died shortly after I got to work a couple days ago, and I wasn't able to fix it until I got home. 10 hours of straight unplanned downtime is unacceptable for any server, even a personal website, IMO. > And since you don't need all that abstraction, dynamic content, and CMS (your OS is the CMS!) the security problems everyone loves to jump on simply vanish.

I can create the ability for users of my site to search it. A comment system is a bit of a challenge with my mindset. You can always just embed something like discus but I know that's not a strong argument. I personally implemented it with perl script parsing the logs and editing text files and iframes plus 1 line of JS. While parsing the perl script only accepts characters from a list of something like 30 that are harmless. I admit this is definitely not for everyone. As for search you and I both know that everyone only uses google anyway and it'll work better than whatever you implement. > If I'm hosting it myself, and my server gets hacked, my entire home network becomes at risk. The biggest security hole for everyone is using their browser for *EVERYTHING* by running JS apps instead of self-hosting and just using a native application on their OS. Some 0-day for nginx or $serversoftware is far less likely than the constant stream of browser exploits and far more likely to be patched quickly. You keep saying it creates a security risk at home that doesn't exist otherwise. But that's only if you make it that way and even then it's magnitudes less of a risk than simply running a modern browser. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [rjsw](user?id=rjsw) [on March 28, 2018](item?id=16699777)   | [root](#16699532) | [parent](#16699597) | [prev](#16699721) | [next](#16702816) [–]  The WebRTC implementation in Firefox isn't as configurable as it could be, it just assumes that you are behind a firewall that doesn't understand SCTP so encapsulates everything in UDP and searches for the best way to escape to the internet. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [joering2](user?id=joering2) [on March 28, 2018](item?id=16702816)   | [prev](#16699532) | [next](#16700974) [–]  I'm suprised to see NordVPN is leaking.

Did you know that the US government funded Signal, too? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [happyopossum](user?id=happyopossum) [on March 28, 2018](item?id=16703060)   | [root](#16699635) | [parent](#16701015) | [prev](#16701184) | [next](#16699772) [–]  The US Government has a legitimate reason for creating and supporting mechanisms anonymous Internet use by those under the control of oppressive regimes. Other parts of the US Government appear to have a desire to know everything about everyone all the time. The "US Government" is not one thing, it's an enormous collection of agencies, bureaus, and humans, who sometimes have desires that are at odds with one another. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [piracykills](user?id=piracykills) [on March 28, 2018](item?id=16699772)   | [parent](#16699635) | [prev](#16700227) | [next](#16699740) [–]  It's likely quite profitable, they don't buy bandwidth from Amazon, they get a few colo'd machines or dedicated servers in many DCs - you can get dedicated gigabit lines in several DCs for a few hundred a month. Most subscribers only use the service occasionally and won't place that much load on it. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [protonimitate](user?id=protonimitate) [on March 28, 2018](item?id=16699740)   | [parent](#16699635) | [prev](#16699772) | [next](#16700075) [–]  I don't understand this. Is profitability the only metric for if a service can be trusted or not? It's also not even mentioned in the article linked, not sure why you brought it up at all tbh. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jaxn](user?id=jaxn) [on March 28, 2018](item?id=16699831)   | [root](#16699635) | [parent](#16699740) | [next](#16699833) [–]  Profitability (or the possibility of profitability) is absolutely a measure of whether something can be relied on. And if it can't possibly be profitable, then it means there is likely a non-obvious revenue stream or funding source, which means a ulterior motive. So yeah, if a service can't be profitable, it can't be trusted. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [OrganicMSG](user?id=OrganicMSG) [on March 28, 2018](item?id=16700656)   | [root](#16699635) | [parent](#16699831) | [next](#16699833) [–]  A decent emergency medical response service is never profitable. It requires a vast amount of hospitals to ensure that there is one local enough to wherever you get ill or injured and they all have to be staffed by lots of different highly qualified specialists who are in as regular practice as possible. If you were going to require that they be profitable, there simply are not enough rich people for the doctors to work on in order to stay in good practice, or to pay for enough suitably equipped hospitals to ensure a short travel time in an emergency. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ElevenLathe](user?id=ElevenLathe) [on March 28, 2018](item?id=16700871)   | [root](#16699635) | [parent](#16700656) | [next](#16702519) [–]  In the US, we essentially do require that they all be profitable or else not exist at all. This is "solved" by just charging you (or your insurance company) tons of money if you actually need to use it. A medical emergency requiring an ER and an ambulance can easily cost as much or more than an ordinary person will earn in their whole lifetime. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [OrganicMSG](user?id=OrganicMSG) [on March 28, 2018](item?id=16701864)   | [root](#16699635) | [parent](#16700871) | [next](#16702519) [–]  > A medical emergency requiring an ER and an ambulance can easily cost as much or more than an ordinary person will earn in their whole lifetime. The majority of hospitals with E.R. in the US are non-profits that receive federal subsidies to help them exist. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ElevenLathe](user?id=ElevenLathe) [on March 29, 2018](item?id=16706500)   | [root](#16699635) | [parent](#16701864) | [next](#16702519) [–]  But not enough subsidy that they are remotely affordable, hence the outrageous bills foisted upon individuals. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jaxn](user?id=jaxn) [on March 28, 2018](item?id=16702519)   | [root](#16699635) | [parent](#16700656) | [prev](#16700871) | [next](#16699833) [–]  Good point. I should have been more clear about "non-obvious" funding sources. If a service isn't profitable, but has a clear funding source (philanthropy, government, etc), that is a little different. But the motive for that funding would need to be clear as well. So yeah, charities can be ok. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [OrganicMSG](user?id=OrganicMSG) [on March 29, 2018](item?id=16703581)   | [root](#16699635) | [parent](#16702519) | [next](#16699833) [–]  I can see where you are coming from, I just think obvious profitability is a poor heuristic for trust, not only due to altruism, but also because some people like showing off, some people are pure hobbyists, some people are trying to make art and many people are just downright weird, though not necessarily in a way that is going to really do much damage. It isn't always as simple as looking for an obvious motive, though I would agree to always keep an eye out for where the money comes from and if there is a game and if you are a mark. However that should apply whether or not something looks profitable on the surface, otherwise you drop all cynicism the moment someone tells you the right story. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tehwebguy](user?id=tehwebguy) [on March 28, 2018](item?id=16699833)   | [root](#16699635) | [parent](#16699740) | [prev](#16699831) | [next](#16700075) [–]  Makes total sense -- if they aren't making money on the service they sell they will naturally have to do something else to keep the lights / servers on. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [rubbingalcohol](user?id=rubbingalcohol) [on March 28, 2018](item?id=16700075)   | [parent](#16699635) | [prev](#16699740) | [next](#16699723) [–]  I worked at a well-known civil rights advocacy nonprofit for a long time and Private Internet Access was one of our major supporters. The owner is a huge ally of Internet freedom and privacy - a very good person who is an activist in their own way and using their success to make a positive impact. So perhaps I'm biased (even though I'm not in nonprofit anymore), but I would put the chance of an NSA honeypot at close to 0%... | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [wlesieutre](user?id=wlesieutre) [on March 28, 2018](item?id=16700360)   | [root](#16699635) | [parent](#16700075) | [next](#16699723) [–]  Krita’s 4.0 release was on here recently, which reminded me of this <https://krita.org/en/item/krita-foundation-update/> PIA put up £20,000 to keep them going after a tax mixup dropped a large bill on the foundation.

# WebRTC-Leak

Check if your VPN leaks your IP address via the WebRTC technology.

# 23% of tested VPNs leaks users' IPs

## WebRTC

Browsers have implemented WebRTC that allow requests to STUN servers be made that will return the local and public IP addresses for the user. These request results are available to javascript, so you can now obtain a users local and public IP addresses in javascript. This demo: <https://ip.voidsec.com/> is an example implementation of that.

Additionally, these STUN requests are made outside of the normal XMLHttpRequest procedure, so they are not visible in the developer console and cannot be blocked by plugins such as AdBlockPlus or Ghostery. This makes these types of requests available for online tracking, de-anonymize and trace users behind common privacy protection services such as: VPN, SOCKS Proxy, HTTP Proxy and (in the past) TOR users.

# Many VPN Providers Leak Customer's IP Address via WebRTC Bug

![WebRTC IP leak](https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/posts/2018/03/28/VPN-WebRTC-Leak.png)

Around 20% of today's top VPN solutions are leaking the customer's IP address via a WebRTC bug known since January 2015, and which apparently some VPN providers have never heard of.

The discovery belongs to Paolo Stagno, a security researcher who goes by the pseudonym of [VoidSec](https://voidsec.com/), and who recently audited 83 VPN apps on this old WebRTC IP leak.

Stagno says he found that 17 VPN clients were leaking the user's IP address while surfing the web via a browser.

The researcher published his results in a [Google Docs spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Nm7mxfFvmdn-3Az-BtE5O0BIdbJiIAWUnkoAF_v_0ug/edit#gid=0). The audit list is incomplete because Stagno didn't have the financial resources to test all commercial VPN clients.

The researcher is now asking the community to test their own VPN clients and send him the results. For this, he set up a [demo web page](https://ip.voidsec.com/) that users must access in their browser with their VPN client enabled. The code running on this page is also available [on GitHub](https://github.com/VoidSec/WebRTC-Leak), if users want to test the leak locally, without exposing their IP on somebody else's server.

## WebRTC leak known since 2015

Stagno's code is based on the WebRTC bug [discovered](https://github.com/diafygi/webrtc-ips) in January 2015 by security researcher Daniel Roesler. Back then, Roesler found that WebRTC STUN servers, which intermediate WebRTC connections, will keep records of the user's public IP address, along with his private IP address, if the client is behind-NAT network, proxy, or VPN client.

The problem was that STUN servers would disclose this information to websites that had already negotiated an WebRTC connection with a user's browser.

Since then, many advertisers and law enforcement agencies have used this WebRTC-related bug to acquire a site's visitor's IP address.

## Most browsers come with WebRTC enabled by default

Browsers, who at that point spent years integrating WebRTC support in their code, rolled out features or official add-ons that would prevent the IP leak, albeit cripple some of WebRTC's real-time communications features.

Nonetheless, browsers didn't disable WebRTC, and the feature is still enabled by default in all major browsers —except the Tor Browser, Edge, and Internet Explorer.

![Status of WebRTC in modern browsers](https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/986406/Software/VPN/VPN-WebRTC-browser-support.png)

Below is a list of VPN providers that Stagno found vulnerable to IP leaks. Around 80 commercial VPN providers remained untested at the time of writing. For updated results, please refer to Stagno's Google Docs sheet.

BolehVPN (USA Only)

ChillGlobal (Chrome and Firefox Plugin)

Glype (Depends on the configuration)

hide-me.org

Hola!VPN

Hola!VPN Chrome Extension

HTTP PROXY navigation in browsers that support Web RTC

IBVPN Browser Addon

PHP Proxy

phx.piratebayproxy.co

psiphon3 (not leaking if using L2TP/IP)

PureVPN

SmartHide Proxy (depends on config)

SOCKS Proxy on browsers with Web RTC enabled

SumRando Web Proxy

TOR as PROXY on browsers with Web RTC enabled

Windscribe Addons

## Some VPNs keep logs

And in another similarly worrisome research, the team at TheBestVPN.com also [discovered](https://thebestvpn.com/118-vpns-logging-policy/) that 26 out of 115 VPN clients they tested kept some types of log files.

The study didn't analyze actual VPN client installations, but privacy policies published online by each service.

* You can check if your VPN leaks visiting: <http://ip.voidsec.com>
* Here you can find the complete list of the VPN providers that I’ve tested: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Nm7mxfFvmdn-3Az-BtE5O0BIdbJiIAWUnkoAF_v_0ug/edit#gid=0>
* Add a comment or send me a tweet if you have updated results for any of the VPN which I am missing details. (especially the “$$$” one, since I cannot subscribe to 200 different payed VPN services :P)

![](https://voidsec.com/wp-content/uploads/porto_placeholders/100x68.jpg)Some time ago, during a small event in my city, I’ve presented a small research on “decloaking” the true IP of a website visitor (ab)using the WebRTC technology (thx to [wsx](https://twitter.com/wsxarcher) for the tip).

### What is WebRTC?

**WebRTC is a free, open project** that provides browsers and mobile applications with Real-Time Communications (RTC) capabilities via simple APIs.

It includes the fundamental building blocks for high-quality communications on the web, such as network, audio and video components used in voice and video chat applications, these components, when implemented in a browser, can be accessed through a JavaScript API, enabling developers to easily implement their own RTC web app.

### STUN/ICE

Is a component allowing calls to use the STUN and ICE mechanisms to establish connections across various types of networks. The STUN server sends a ping back that contains the IP address and port of the client

These STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) servers are used by VPNs to **translate a local home IP address to a new public IP address and vice-versa**. To do this, the STUN server maintains a table of both your VPN-based public IP and your local (“real”) IP during connectivity (routers at home replicate a similar function in translating private IP addresses to public and back.).

WebRTC allows requests to be made to STUN servers which return the “hidden” home IP-address as well as local network addresses for the system that is being used by the user.

The results of the requests can be accessed using JavaScript, but because they are made outside the normal XML/HTTP request procedure, they are not visible in the developer console.

The only requirement for this de-anonymizing technique to work is WebRTC and JavaScript support from the browser.

### VPN and WebRTC

**This functionality could be also used to de-anonymize and trace users behind common privacy protection services such as: VPN, SOCKS Proxy, HTTP Proxy** and, in the past, TOR users.

Browsers that have WebRTC enabled by default:

* **Brave**
* **Edge** (it does not leaks at the moment since it doesn’t support ‘createDataChannel’)
* **Epiphany** (Gnome)
* **Mozilla Firefox**
* **Google Chrome**
* **Google Chrome on Android**
* **Internet** (Samsung Browser)
* **Opera**
* **Safari**
* **Vivaldi**

**16% of the tested VPNs and Proxies services disclosed the real IP address of the visitors making the users traceable.**

The following providers leaks users’ IP:

* Astrill
* BlackVPN
* ChillGlobal (Chrome and Firefox Plugin)
* CyrenVPN
* Glype (Depends on the configuration)
* hide-me.org
* Hola!VPN
* Hola!VPN (Chrome Extension)
* Hoxx VPN (Firefox Browser Plugin)
* HTTP PROXY in browser that support Web RTC
* IBVPN (Browser Addon)
* PHP Proxy
* phx.piratebayproxy.co
* psiphon3 (not leaking if using L2TP/IP)
* SmartHideProxy
* SOCKS Proxy on browsers with Web RTC enabled
* SumRando Web Proxy
* TOR as PROXY on browsers with Web RTC enabled
* Windscribe Addons (Browser Extension/Plugin)

You can find the complete spreadsheet of tested VPN providers here: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Nm7mxfFvmdn-3Az-BtE5O0BIdbJiIAWUnkoAF_v_0ug/edit#gid=0>

Add a comment or send me a tweet if you have updated results for any of the VPN which I am missing details. (especially the “$$$” one, since I cannot subscribe to 200 different payed VPN services :P)

### Stay anonymous while surfing:

Some tips to follow in order to protect your IP during the internet navigation:

* Disable WebRTC
* Disable JavaScript (or at least some functions. [Use NoScript](https://noscript.net/))
* Disable Canvas Rendering (Web API)
* Always set a DNS fallback for every connection/adapter
* Always kill all your browsers istances before and after a VPN connection
* Clear browser cache, history and cookies
* Drop all outgoing connections except for VPN provider

### PoC:

You can check if your VPN leaks through this POC: <http://ip.voidsec.com>

### PoC Code:

I’ve updated Daniel Roesler code in order to make it works again and [you can find it on Github](https://github.com/VoidSec/WebRTC-Leak).
