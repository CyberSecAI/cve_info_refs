    "description": "Integer overflow in posix_memalign in memalign functions",
    "root_cause": "An integer overflow in the implementation of the posix_memalign function in glibc's memalign functions occurs when a size close to SIZE_MAX is provided.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Incorrect memory allocation"
    ],
    "impact": "Heap corruption due to insufficient memory allocation. This can lead to crashes, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Application providing large allocation size"
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to call posix_memalign or similar memory allocation functions with a size close to SIZE_MAX.",

      {
        "source": "bugs.debian.org",
        "details": "The posix_memalign function does not properly report an error when allocating sizes close to SIZE_MAX. This causes the program to crash due to heap corruption."

       "details":"An integer overflow in the implementation of the posix_memalign in memalign functions in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.26 and earlier could cause these functions to return a pointer to a heap area that is too small, potentially leading to heap corruption."

        "source":"sourceware.org_ca55da9e",
        "details":"When posix_memalign is called with an alignment less than MALLOC_ALIGNMENT and a requested size close to SIZE_MAX, it falls back to malloc code. In this case, an integer overflow in _int_malloc leads to posix_memalign incorrectly returning successfully.\n\n When posix_memalign is called with an alignment larger than MALLOC_ALIGNMENT and a requested size close to SIZE_MAX, a different integer overflow in _int_memalign leads to posix_memalign incorrectly returning successfully."
