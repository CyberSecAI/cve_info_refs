      "Ability to execute code on the target system.",
      "Ability to perform bind operations on IRDA sockets."
    ],
      "details": "The vulnerability is triggered due to missing checks in the `irda_bind()` function in `drivers/staging/irda/net/af_irda.c` (or `net/irda/af_irda.c` in newer kernels). Specifically, the function allocates memory for `self->ias_obj` without verifying if the socket is already bound. This leads to a memory leak if a process repeatedly binds to the same IRDA socket. Each bind operation allocates a new object in the LM-IAS database without freeing the old one, eventually exhausting available memory. The fix involves adding a check to ensure `self->ias_obj` is not already assigned before proceeding with the allocation. If the socket is already bound, the bind operation will return an error, preventing the memory leak.",
