*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

## Details

Jann Horn discovered that the vmacache subsystem did not properly handle

sequence number overflows, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-17182](/security/CVE-2018-17182))

It was discovered that the paravirtualization implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle some indirect calls, reducing the

effectiveness of Spectre v2 mitigations for paravirtual guests. A local

attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-15594](/security/CVE-2018-15594))

It was discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and

prediction of return addresses via Return Stack Buffer (RSB) may allow

unauthorized memory reads via sidechannel attacks. An attacker could use

this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-15572](/security/CVE-2018-15572))

Andy Lutomirski and Mika Penttilä discovered that the KVM implementation

in the Linux kernel did not properly check privilege levels when emulating

some instructions. An unprivileged attacker in a guest VM could use this to

escalate privileges within the guest. ([CVE-2018-10853](/security/CVE-2018-10853))

It was discovered that a stack-based buffer overflow existed in the iSCSI

target implementation of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-14633](/security/CVE-2018-14633))

It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the IRDA subsystem of the

Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2018-6554](/security/CVE-2018-6554))

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the IRDA

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-6555](/security/CVE-2018-6555))

USN 3652-1 added a mitigation for Speculative Store Bypass

a.k.a. Spectre Variant 4 ([CVE-2018-3639](/security/CVE-2018-3639)). This update provides the

corresponding mitigation for ARM64 processors. Please note that for

this mitigation to be effective, an updated firmware for the processor

may be required.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

```
The irda_bind() function allocates memory for self->ias_obj without
checking to see if the socket is already bound. A userspace process
could repeatedly bind the socket, have each new object added into the
LM-IAS database, and lose the reference to the old object assigned to
the socket to exhaust memory resources. This patch errors out of the
bind operation when self->ias_obj is already assigned.

## Details

Jann Horn discovered that the vmacache subsystem did not properly handle

sequence number overflows, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-17182](/security/CVE-2018-17182))

It was discovered that the paravirtualization implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle some indirect calls, reducing the

effectiveness of Spectre v2 mitigations for paravirtual guests. A local

attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-15594](/security/CVE-2018-15594))

It was discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and

prediction of return addresses via Return Stack Buffer (RSB) may allow

unauthorized memory reads via sidechannel attacks. An attacker could use

this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-15572](/security/CVE-2018-15572))

It was discovered that a NULL pointer dereference could be triggered in the

OCFS2 file system implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2017-18216](/security/CVE-2017-18216))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the raw MIDI driver for

the Linux kernel, leading to a double free vulnerability. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-10902](/security/CVE-2018-10902))

It was discovered that a stack-based buffer overflow existed in the iSCSI

target implementation of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-14633](/security/CVE-2018-14633))

It was discovered that the YUREX USB device driver for the Linux kernel did

not properly restrict user space reads or writes. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-16276](/security/CVE-2018-16276))

It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the IRDA subsystem of the

Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2018-6554](/security/CVE-2018-6554))

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the IRDA

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-6555](/security/CVE-2018-6555))

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux-azure](/security/cves?package=linux-azure) - Linux kernel for Microsoft Azure Cloud systems

## Details

USN-3777-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 18.04

%LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the

Linux kernel for Azure Cloud systems.

Jann Horn discovered that the vmacache subsystem did not properly handle

sequence number overflows, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-17182](/security/CVE-2018-17182))

It was discovered that the paravirtualization implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle some indirect calls, reducing the

effectiveness of Spectre v2 mitigations for paravirtual guests. A local

attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-15594](/security/CVE-2018-15594))

It was discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and

prediction of return addresses via Return Stack Buffer (RSB) may allow

unauthorized memory reads via sidechannel attacks. An attacker could use

this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-15572](/security/CVE-2018-15572))

Jann Horn discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution

and branch prediction may allow unauthorized memory reads via sidechannel

attacks. This flaw is known as Spectre. A local attacker could use this to

expose sensitive information, including kernel memory. ([CVE-2017-5715](/security/CVE-2017-5715))

It was discovered that a stack-based buffer overflow existed in the iSCSI

target implementation of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-14633](/security/CVE-2018-14633))

Jann Horn and Ken Johnson discovered that microprocessors utilizing

speculative execution of a memory read may allow unauthorized memory reads

via a sidechannel attack. This flaw is known as Spectre Variant 4. A local

attacker could use this to expose sensitive information, including kernel

memory. ([CVE-2018-3639](/security/CVE-2018-3639))

It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the IRDA subsystem of the

Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2018-6554](/security/CVE-2018-6554))

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the IRDA

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-6555](/security/CVE-2018-6555))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

##### Ubuntu 16.04

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

Debian Bug     : 890034 896911 907581 915229 915231

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2017-18249

    A race condition was discovered in the disk space allocator of
    F2FS. A user with access to an F2FS volume could use this to cause
    a denial of service or other security impact.

CVE-2018-1128, CVE-2018-1129

    The cephx authentication protocol used by Ceph was susceptible to
    replay attacks, and calculated signatures incorrectly. These
    vulnerabilities in the server required changes to authentication
    that are incompatible with existing clients. The kernel's client
    code has now been updated to be compatible with the fixed server.

CVE-2018-3639 (SSB)

    Multiple researchers have discovered that Speculative Store Bypass
    (SSB), a feature implemented in many processors, could be used to
    read sensitive information from another context. In particular,
    code in a software sandbox may be able to read sensitive
    information from outside the sandbox. This issue is also known as
    Spectre variant 4.

    This update adds a further mitigation for this issue in the eBPF
    (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) implementation.

CVE-2018-5391 (FragmentSmack)

    Juha-Matti Tilli discovered a flaw in the way the Linux kernel
    handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote
    attacker can take advantage of this flaw to trigger time and
    calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithms by sending
    specially crafted packets, leading to remote denial of service.

    This was previously mitigated by reducing the default limits on
    memory usage for incomplete fragmented packets. This update
    replaces that mitigation with a more complete fix.

CVE-2018-5848

    The wil6210 wifi driver did not properly validate lengths in scan
    and connection requests, leading to a possible buffer overflow.
    On systems using this driver, a local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability could use this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or potentially for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-12896, CVE-2018-13053

    Team OWL337 reported possible integer overflows in the POSIX
    timer implementation. These might have some security impact.

CVE-2018-13096, CVE-2018-13097, CVE-2018-13100, CVE-2018-14614,
CVE-2018-14616

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported that crafted F2FS volumes
    could trigger a crash (BUG, Oops, or division by zero) and/or
    out-of-bounds memory access. An attacker able to mount such a
    volume could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-13406

    Dr Silvio Cesare of InfoSect reported a potential integer overflow
    in the uvesafb driver. A user with permission to access such a
    device might be able to use this for denial of service or
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-14610, CVE-2018-14611, CVE-2018-14612, CVE-2018-14613

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported that crafted Btrfs volumes
    could trigger a crash (Oops) and/or out-of-bounds memory access.
    An attacker able to mount such a volume could use this to cause a
    denial of service or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-15471 ((XSA-270)

    Felix Wilhelm of Google Project Zero discovered a flaw in the hash
    handling of the xen-netback Linux kernel module. A malicious or
    buggy frontend may cause the (usually privileged) backend to make
    out of bounds memory accesses, potentially resulting in privilege
    escalation, denial of service, or information leaks.

    <https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-270.html>

CVE-2018-16862

    Vasily Averin and Pavel Tikhomirov from Virtuozzo Kernel Team
    discovered that the cleancache memory management feature did not
    invalidate cached data for deleted files. On Xen guests using the
    tmem driver, local users could potentially read data from other
    users' deleted files if they were able to create new files on the
    same volume.

CVE-2018-17972

    Jann Horn reported that the /proc/*/stack files in procfs leaked
    sensitive data from the kernel. These files are now only readable
    by users with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (usually only root)

CVE-2018-18281

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the virtual memory manager
    that can result in a process briefly having access to memory after
    it is freed and reallocated. A local user could possibly exploit
    this for denial of service (memory corruption) or for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2018-18690

    Kanda Motohiro reported that XFS did not correctly handle some
    xattr (extended attribute) writes that require changing the disk
    format of the xattr. A user with access to an XFS volume could use
    this for denial of service.

CVE-2018-18710

    It was discovered that the cdrom driver does not correctly
    validate the parameter to the CDROM_SELECT_DISC ioctl. A user with
    access to a cdrom device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-19407

    Wei Wu reported a potential crash (Oops) in the KVM implementation
    for x86 processors. A user with access to /dev/kvm could use this
    for denial of service.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.144-3.1~deb8u1.  This version also includes fixes for Debian bugs
#890034, #896911, #907581, #915229, and #915231; and other fixes
included in upstream stable updates.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.9 packages.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux-gcp](/security/cves?package=linux-gcp) - Linux kernel for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) systems
* [linux-hwe](/security/cves?package=linux-hwe) - Linux hardware enablement (HWE) kernel

## Details

USN-3777-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 18.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 18.04 LTS for Ubuntu

16.04 LTS.

Jann Horn discovered that the vmacache subsystem did not properly handle

sequence number overflows, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-17182](/security/CVE-2018-17182))

It was discovered that the paravirtualization implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle some indirect calls, reducing the

effectiveness of Spectre v2 mitigations for paravirtual guests. A local

attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-15594](/security/CVE-2018-15594))

It was discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and

prediction of return addresses via Return Stack Buffer (RSB) may allow

unauthorized memory reads via sidechannel attacks. An attacker could use

this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-15572](/security/CVE-2018-15572))

Andy Lutomirski and Mika Penttilä discovered that the KVM implementation

in the Linux kernel did not properly check privilege levels when emulating

some instructions. An unprivileged attacker in a guest VM could use this to

escalate privileges within the guest. ([CVE-2018-10853](/security/CVE-2018-10853))

It was discovered that a stack-based buffer overflow existed in the iSCSI

target implementation of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-14633](/security/CVE-2018-14633))

It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the IRDA subsystem of the

Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2018-6554](/security/CVE-2018-6554))

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the IRDA

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-6555](/security/CVE-2018-6555))

USN 3653-2 added a mitigation for Speculative Store Bypass

a.k.a. Spectre Variant 4 ([CVE-2018-3639](/security/CVE-2018-3639)). This update provides the

corresponding mitigation for ARM64 processors. Please note that for

this mitigation to be effective, an updated firmware for the processor

may be required.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-36-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-36.39~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.15.0-36.39~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-36-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-36.39~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.15.0-36.39~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-36-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-36.39~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.15.0-36.39~16.04.1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## [Variant4](/SecurityTeam/KnowledgeBase/Variant4)

## Speculative Store Bypass (CVE-2018-3639 aka GPZ Variant 4)

Ken Johnson of the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) and Jann Horn of Google Project Zero (GPZ) independently [discovered another variant](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1528) of a cache speculation timing side channel attack, similar to the issues previously disclosed under the names [Spectre and Meltdown](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/KnowledgeBase/SpectreAndMeltdown).

With this variant, currently known as Variant 4, systems with microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and speculative execution of a memory read, before the addresses of all prior memory writes are known, may allow unauthorized disclosure of information to an attacker with local user access via a side channel analysis. More colloquially, in one example, Variant 4 can reveal the value of stored data when a load following a store speculatively retrieves the earlier value.

### Mitigations

Some mitigations for Spectre v2 also help to mitigate some of the effects of this vulnerability, for example, the reduction in timer precision in browsers renders this variant much more difficult to exploit.

The Speculative Store Bypass vulnerability can be mitigated by setting the newly defined Speculative Store Bypass Disable (SSBD) bit in the IA32\_SPEC\_CTRL Model-Specific Register (MSR) of x86 processors. Support for this mitigation requires updated microcode for Intel processors. New microcode is not needed for AMD processors.

In Ubuntu, SSBD is OFF by default because it is not needed by most programs and carries a notable performance impact. A prctl() has been added (PR\_SPEC\_STORE\_BYPASS) that enables developers to opt into the mitigation on a per process basis. Applications using a seccomp filter will be implicitly opted into the mitigations. This means that strict and devmode snaps, processes inside of LXD containers, sandboxed processes of the Firefox and Chromium browsers, among some other processes running in a default Ubuntu install on x86 processors, will have the SSBD mitigation enabled out of the box.

Users can explicitly opt-in to SSBD mitigations, on a system-wide basis, by booting with the spec\_store\_bypass\_disable=on boot parameter. See the [Mitigation Controls](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/KnowledgeBase/SpectreAndMeltdown/MitigationControls#CVE-2018-3639) page for details on available boot options.

### Update Status

Ubuntu users are recommended to update to the latest kernel, qemu, libvirt, and intel-microcode packages. Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, 17.10, 16.04 LTS, and 14.04 LTS were affected. 12.04 ESM remains affected but updates are in progress.

#### Bare Metal and Virtual Machines with Intel Processors

QEMU and kernel updates were released to allow bare metal Ubuntu systems to make use of SSBD. Additionally, these updates allow virtualized Ubuntu systems to make use of SSBD with x86 Intel processors. Consult the following table for version information:

| **Package** | **USN** |
| --- | --- |
| Linux Kernel (18.04 LTS) | [USN-3652-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3652-1/) |
| Linux Kernel (17.10) | [USN-3653-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3653-1/) |
| Linux Kernel (16.04 LTS) | [USN-3654-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3654-1/), [USN-3653-2](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3653-2/) |
| Linux Kernel (14.04 LTS) | [USN-3655-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3655-1/), [USN-3654-2](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3654-2/) |
| QEMU | [USN-3651-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3651-1/) |
| intel-microcode | [USN-3756-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3756-1/) |

The required intel-microcode updates are not available at this time. Canonical will continue to work with Intel and release intel-microcode updates once they're production ready. In the meantime, you may be able to access updated microcode for your processor in the form of OEM firmware updates.

#### Virtual Machines with AMD Processors

Additional QEMU, libvirt, and kernel updates were released to allow virtual machines to make use of SSBD support with x86 AMD processors. Consult the following table for version information:

| **Package** | **USN** |
| --- | --- |
| Linux Kernel (18.04 LTS) | [USN-3678-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3678-1/), [USN-3678-3](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3678-3/) |
| Linux Kernel (17.10) | [USN-3677-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3677-1/) |
| Linux Kernel (16.04 LTS) | [USN-3676-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3676-1/), [USN-3677-2](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3677-2/), [USN-3678-2](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3678-2/) |
| Linux Kernel (14.04 LTS) | [USN-3674-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3674-1/), [USN-3676-2](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3676-2/) |
| QEMU | [USN-3679-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3679-1/) |
| libvirt | [USN-3680-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3680-1/) |

#### ARM64 Processors

Kernel updates were released to Ubuntu 18.04 LTS to address CVE-2018-3639 on some ARM64 processors. The updated kernels will dynamically mitigate the speculative store bypass vulnerability on [Cortex-A76](https://developer.arm.com/support/arm-security-updates/speculative-processor-vulnerability) and the Cavium [ThunderX2](/ThunderX2) processor family with the appropriate firmware update. Consult the following table for Ubuntu kernel version information:

| **Package** | **USN** |
| --- | --- |
| Linux Kernel (18.04 LTS) | [USN-3777-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3777-1/) |
| Linux HWE Kernel (16.04 LTS) | [USN-3777-2](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3777-2/) |

### Verifying Your System

To check if your system is protected against CVE-2018-3639, you can run the following command and compare the output:
```
  $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spec_store_bypass
  Mitigation: Speculative Store Bypass disabled via prctl and seccomp
```

The example above shows a system that is mitigated against CVE-2018-3639.

A system that is not running an updated kernel will not have the file indicating the vulnerability status and the system should be considered vulnerable:
```
  $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spec_store_bypass
  cat: /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spec_store_bypass: No such file or directory
```

If the file exists but the system does not have updated microcode, or an updated hypervisor in the case of a virtual machine, the output will indicate that the system is vulnerable:
```
  $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spec_store_bypass
  Vulnerable
```

### Configuration as a Hypervisor

**IMPORTANT:** As outlined above using ssbd is not strictly required, but as a hypervisor you might want/need to leave the decision to opt into this feature to your guests. To be able to do so you need to make the ssbd feature available to them.

#### QEMU/KVM

From QEMUs point of view the ssbd CPU feature is not part of any pre-defined cpu models. On a Host with the required CPU microcode to support the feature it can be explicitly turned on to be usable by the guest.

You can check if the host system has the ssbd feature used to mitigate this issue with:

```
$ grep 'ssbd' /proc/cpuinfo
  flags           : ... ssbd
```

If the above is true then the ssbd feature will automatically be passed to the guest when using the CPU model host. For all other CPU models the feature needs to be added explicitly. For example if before you had used the CPU model *Haswell* the respective part of the command line would then have look like:

```
    -cpu Haswell,+ssbd
```

#### Libvirt

You can check your stack of Firmware, Kernel, QEMU and Libvirt is ready to expose the ssbd flag to guests by checking the capabilities.

```
$ virsh domcapabilities kvm | grep ssbd
    <feature policy='require' name='ssbd'/>
```

If the above is true then the ssbd feature will automatically be passed to the guest in the CPU modes host-passthrough and host-model.

In all other cases the definition of the CPU that is presented to the guest needs to be modified. You can do so in the [guests CPU element](https://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsCPU). While the rest of the CPU model specification depends on your case, adding the ssbd feature is the same and will look like

```
<cpu ...
    <feature policy='require' name='ssbd'/>
</cpu>
```

**IMPORTANT:** Even if you have a configuration - for example using host-passthrough - that does not need a configuration change, still guests needs to be fully shut down and restarted to pick up the new feature flags.

                 CVE-2018-16658 CVE-2018-17182

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2018-6554

    A memory leak in the irda_bind function in the irda subsystem was
    discovered. A local user can take advantage of this flaw to cause a
    denial of service (memory consumption).

CVE-2018-6555

    A flaw was discovered in the irda_setsockopt function in the irda
    subsystem, allowing a local user to cause a denial of service
    (use-after-free and system crash).

CVE-2018-7755

    Brian Belleville discovered a flaw in the fd_locked_ioctl function
    in the floppy driver in the Linux kernel. The floppy driver copies a
    kernel pointer to user memory in response to the FDGETPRM ioctl. A
    local user with access to a floppy drive device can take advantage
    of this flaw to discover the location kernel code and data.

CVE-2018-9363

    It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation did not
    correctly check the length of received report messages. A paired
    HIDP device could use this to cause a buffer overflow, leading to
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or potentially
    remote code execution.

CVE-2018-9516

    It was discovered that the HID events interface in debugfs did not
    correctly limit the length of copies to user buffers.  A local
    user with access to these files could use this to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.  However, by default debugfs is only
    accessible by the root user.

CVE-2018-10902

    It was discovered that the rawmidi kernel driver does not protect
    against concurrent access which leads to a double-realloc (double
    free) flaw. A local attacker can take advantage of this issue for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-10938

    Yves Younan from Cisco reported that the Cipso IPv4 module did not
    correctly check the length of IPv4 options. On custom kernels with
    CONFIG_NETLABEL enabled, a remote attacker could use this to cause
    a denial of service (hang).

CVE-2018-13099

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported a use-after-free bug in the
    F2FS implementation. An attacker able to mount a crafted F2FS
    volume could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-14609

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported a potential null pointer
    dereference in the F2FS implementation. An attacker able to mount
    arbitrary F2FS volumes could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-14617

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported a potential null pointer
    dereference in the HFS+ implementation. An attacker able to mount
    arbitrary HFS+ volumes could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-14633

    Vincent Pelletier discovered a stack-based buffer overflow flaw in
    the chap_server_compute_md5() function in the iSCSI target code. An
    unauthenticated remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to
    cause a denial of service or possibly to get a non-authorized access
    to data exported by an iSCSI target.

CVE-2018-14678

    M. Vefa Bicakci and Andy Lutomirski discovered a flaw in the
    kernel exit code used on amd64 systems running as Xen PV guests.
    A local user could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2018-14734

    A use-after-free bug was discovered in the InfiniBand
    communication manager. A local user could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possible for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-15572

    Esmaiel Mohammadian Koruyeh, Khaled Khasawneh, Chengyu Song, and
    Nael Abu-Ghazaleh, from University of California, Riverside,
    reported a variant of Spectre variant 2, dubbed SpectreRSB. A
    local user may be able to use this to read sensitive information
    from processes owned by other users.

CVE-2018-15594

    Nadav Amit reported that some indirect function calls used in
    paravirtualised guests were vulnerable to Spectre variant 2.  A
    local user may be able to use this to read sensitive information
    from the kernel.

CVE-2018-16276

    Jann Horn discovered that the yurex driver did not correctly limit
    the length of copies to user buffers.  A local user with access to
    a yurex device node could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-16658

    It was discovered that the cdrom driver does not correctly
    validate the parameter to the CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS ioctl.  A user
    with access to a cdrom device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-17182

    Jann Horn discovered that the vmacache_flush_all function mishandles
    sequence number overflows. A local user can take advantage of this
    flaw to trigger a use-after-free, causing a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or privilege escalation.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.110-3+deb9u5~deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.9 packages.

```
The irda_bind() function allocates memory for self->ias_obj without
checking to see if the socket is already bound. A userspace process
could repeatedly bind the socket, have each new object added into the
LM-IAS database, and lose the reference to the old object assigned to
the socket to exhaust memory resources. This patch errors out of the
bind operation when self->ias_obj is already assigned.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-trusty](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-trusty) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Trusty for Precise ESM

## Details

USN-3775-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 14.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 14.04 LTS for Ubuntu

12.04 ESM.

It was discovered that the paravirtualization implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle some indirect calls, reducing the

effectiveness of Spectre v2 mitigations for paravirtual guests. A local

attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-15594](/security/CVE-2018-15594))

It was discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and

prediction of return addresses via Return Stack Buffer (RSB) may allow

unauthorized memory reads via sidechannel attacks. An attacker could use

this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-15572](/security/CVE-2018-15572))

It was discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in the

Linux kernel when loading an executable to run. A local attacker could use

this to gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2018-14634](/security/CVE-2018-14634))

It was discovered that a stack-based buffer overflow existed in the iSCSI

target implementation of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-14633](/security/CVE-2018-14633))

It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the IRDA subsystem of the

Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2018-6554](/security/CVE-2018-6554))

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the IRDA

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-6555](/security/CVE-2018-6555))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.13.0-160-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-160.210~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-160.210~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.13.0-160-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-160.210~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-160.210~precise1)
* [linux-image-generic-lpae-lts-trusty](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0.160.150](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-160.210~precise1)
* [linux-image-generic-lts-trusty](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0.160.150](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-160.210~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

the Linux kernel, leading to a double free vulnerability. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-10902](/security/CVE-2018-10902))

It was discovered that a stack-based buffer overflow existed in the iSCSI

target implementation of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-14633](/security/CVE-2018-14633))

It was discovered that the YUREX USB device driver for the Linux kernel did

not properly restrict user space reads or writes. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-16276](/security/CVE-2018-16276))

It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the IRDA subsystem of the

Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2018-6554](/security/CVE-2018-6554))

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the IRDA

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-6555](/security/CVE-2018-6555))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

                 CVE-2018-16658 CVE-2018-17182

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2018-6554

    A memory leak in the irda_bind function in the irda subsystem was
    discovered. A local user can take advantage of this flaw to cause a
    denial of service (memory consumption).

CVE-2018-6555

    A flaw was discovered in the irda_setsockopt function in the irda
    subsystem, allowing a local user to cause a denial of service
    (use-after-free and system crash).

CVE-2018-7755

    Brian Belleville discovered a flaw in the fd_locked_ioctl function
    in the floppy driver in the Linux kernel. The floppy driver copies a
    kernel pointer to user memory in response to the FDGETPRM ioctl. A
    local user with access to a floppy drive device can take advantage
    of this flaw to discover the location kernel code and data.

CVE-2018-9363

    It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation did not
    correctly check the length of received report messages. A paired
    HIDP device could use this to cause a buffer overflow, leading to
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or potentially
    remote code execution.

CVE-2018-9516

    It was discovered that the HID events interface in debugfs did not
    correctly limit the length of copies to user buffers.  A local
    user with access to these files could use this to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.  However, by default debugfs is only
    accessible by the root user.

CVE-2018-10902

    It was discovered that the rawmidi kernel driver does not protect
    against concurrent access which leads to a double-realloc (double
    free) flaw. A local attacker can take advantage of this issue for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-10938

    Yves Younan from Cisco reported that the Cipso IPv4 module did not
    correctly check the length of IPv4 options. On custom kernels with
    CONFIG_NETLABEL enabled, a remote attacker could use this to cause
    a denial of service (hang).

CVE-2018-13099

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported a use-after-free bug in the
    F2FS implementation. An attacker able to mount a crafted F2FS
    volume could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-14609

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported a potential null pointer
    dereference in the F2FS implementation. An attacker able to mount
    a crafted F2FS volume could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-14617

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported a potential null pointer
    dereference in the HFS+ implementation. An attacker able to mount
    a crafted HFS+ volume could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-14633

    Vincent Pelletier discovered a stack-based buffer overflow flaw in
    the chap_server_compute_md5() function in the iSCSI target code. An
    unauthenticated remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to
    cause a denial of service or possibly to get a non-authorized access
    to data exported by an iSCSI target.

CVE-2018-14678

    M. Vefa Bicakci and Andy Lutomirski discovered a flaw in the
    kernel exit code used on amd64 systems running as Xen PV guests.
    A local user could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2018-14734

    A use-after-free bug was discovered in the InfiniBand
    communication manager. A local user could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possible for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-15572

    Esmaiel Mohammadian Koruyeh, Khaled Khasawneh, Chengyu Song, and
    Nael Abu-Ghazaleh, from University of California, Riverside,
    reported a variant of Spectre variant 2, dubbed SpectreRSB. A
    local user may be able to use this to read sensitive information
    from processes owned by other users.

CVE-2018-15594

    Nadav Amit reported that some indirect function calls used in
    paravirtualised guests were vulnerable to Spectre variant 2.  A
    local user may be able to use this to read sensitive information
    from the kernel.

CVE-2018-16276

    Jann Horn discovered that the yurex driver did not correctly limit
    the length of copies to user buffers.  A local user with access to
    a yurex device node could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-16658

    It was discovered that the cdrom driver does not correctly
    validate the parameter to the CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS ioctl.  A user
    with access to a cdrom device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-17182

    Jann Horn discovered that the vmacache_flush_all function mishandles
    sequence number overflows. A local user can take advantage of this
    flaw to trigger a use-after-free, causing a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or privilege escalation.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.110-3+deb9u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

## Details

It was discovered that the paravirtualization implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle some indirect calls, reducing the

effectiveness of Spectre v2 mitigations for paravirtual guests. A local

attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-15594](/security/CVE-2018-15594))

It was discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and

prediction of return addresses via Return Stack Buffer (RSB) may allow

unauthorized memory reads via sidechannel attacks. An attacker could use

this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-15572](/security/CVE-2018-15572))

It was discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in the

Linux kernel when loading an executable to run. A local attacker could use

this to gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2018-14634](/security/CVE-2018-14634))

It was discovered that a stack-based buffer overflow existed in the iSCSI

target implementation of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-14633](/security/CVE-2018-14633))

It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the IRDA subsystem of the

Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2018-6554](/security/CVE-2018-6554))

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the IRDA

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-6555](/security/CVE-2018-6555))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.
