Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6395:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `id` parameter of the `com_visualcalendar` component. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which allows attackers to manipulate database queries. The exploit examples showcase different types of SQL injection:
    *   **Boolean-based blind SQL injection:** Exploited using `AND 2616=2616` type of payloads to infer data based on true/false responses.
    *   **Time-based blind SQL injection:** Exploited using `AND SLEEP(5)` to infer data based on delays in response time.
    *   **UNION-based SQL injection:** Exploited using `UNION ALL SELECT` queries to extract data from the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** An attacker can retrieve sensitive data from the database, including user credentials, configuration settings, and other confidential information.
*   **Database Manipulation:** An attacker can potentially modify or delete data within the database, leading to data loss or corruption.
*   **Full System Compromise:** In severe cases, with sufficient privileges, an attacker might be able to use the SQL injection vulnerability to gain full control of the web server and potentially other connected systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by manipulating the `id` parameter in a GET request to the `index.php` file, specifically targeting the `com_visualcalendar` component:
    `http://localhost/[PATH]/index.php?option=com_visualcalendar&view=load&id=[SQL]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of SQL to craft the necessary malicious payloads.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The provided exploit examples suggest that the vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit examples show how an attacker can extract database information using `UNION` queries.
*   The exploit examples also show how the attacker can identify the vulnerability using blind SQL injection techniques (time based and boolean based).
* The vulnerable component is "Visual Calendar" version 3.1.3 for Joomla.
