Hm, think we should revisit this. The return button was a nice feature. Maybe there's a way it can be done that avoids the vulnerability

Agreed, I want to bring it back especially since a few customers have asked for it. This was a temporary fix since I didn't see a way to quickly change how it works. Preferably, we can just set up the button on template render, but that would require a change in how the URL is passed.

I admint I'm not well-versed in these basic web security stuff, but i don't understand why this is a XSS opportunity. Flask escapes these strings automatically, right? What could an attacker do here?

I don't see how these can be a problem in this case. The "attacker" in this case is the owner of the website which is hosting a form. The "victim" in this case is someone who's already visiting the attacker's website and spontaneously submitting a form there. What could the attacker do that he couldn't do in his own site?

Hi [@fiatjaf](https://github.com/fiatjaf) ,

Unfortunately, you are wrong and It is ("was") a big problem and I will explain.

The "attacker" can tamper with the "\_next" parameter and add malicious js code which will lead to executing the code in the user browser who visited the link and redirects him to a phishing website.

You may want to read on the subject:

<https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/>

<https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html>

Stay Safe.

Sorry, something went wrong.

There are two vulnerability links you reference. For XSS, the attacker could inject a script on a website containing a formspree form to change the value of the `input[name="_next"]` element. However in that case, the attacker is able to change more than just the input, they could override the form's `onSubmit` handler and redirect the form entirely. Also they could inject their own form with an `action="attack.com"`. The solution is to protect against XSS, since once a script is running on the page, it can manipulate the DOM in many ways. I don't think having a hidden input which specifies the redirect following form submission introduces a new vector for XSS.

The second scenario is "open redirect" involving urls of the form `https://trusted.site?next=https://redirect.link`. An attacker could use a link like `https://formspree.io/thanks?next=https://attack.com` in a phishing attack. However this is not an open redirect, because the link doesn't actually result in a redirect. Instead, such a link would render a "thanks" page with a "return to original page" link that the user must click on. We should still remove this vector if possible.

Do you agree with my assessment? Thanks for bringing it back to our attention.

Hi [@colevscode](https://github.com/colevscode),

Very nice, really liked the XSS overview.

But regarding the open redirect, you actually described the vulnerability. In the end, the user will be redirected.
