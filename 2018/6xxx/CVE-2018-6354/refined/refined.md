The provided content is related to a commit that addresses a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, which also includes an open redirect vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of the `next` parameter in the URL, which was used to redirect users after form submission. The value of this parameter was not properly sanitized or validated before being used in the redirect URL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **Open Redirect:** The application was vulnerable to open redirect by allowing an attacker to specify any URL through the `next` parameter, which the application then uses in a redirect link.
2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By injecting a `javascript:` payload into the `next` parameter, an attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking or other malicious activities.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-   **Open Redirect:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites, potentially for phishing attacks or malware distribution.
-   **XSS:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the application, which could be used to steal session cookies, deface the website, or perform other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
-   An attacker can inject a malicious URL into the `next` parameter within a form submission, which gets reflected in the "Return to original site" link after the form submission.
-   An attacker can inject a `javascript:` payload into the `next` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   The attacker needs to control or manipulate the `next` parameter in the URL, which is often part of a form submission. This can be achieved through various means, like manipulating the form before submission, or by crafting a malicious link with the `next` parameter set to a malicious URL.
-   The attacker needs to be able to cause the victim to click on the malicious link that contains the attacker's crafted `next` parameter, or submit a form containing the manipulated parameter.
