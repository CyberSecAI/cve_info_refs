- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `pinboard` parameter in the `com_realpin` component is vulnerable to SQL Injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL queries into the `pinboard` parameter, potentially allowing them to access, modify, or delete data in the database, potentially gaining full control of the application's database.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a crafted HTTP request with a malicious SQL query in the `pinboard` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla application. No specific privileges or authenticated access is required.
