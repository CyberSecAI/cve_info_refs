Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6791:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Insufficient sanitization of FAT/VFAT volume labels by the KDE Plasma workspace's removable device notifier. Specifically, the notifier was not properly handling shell metacharacters such as backticks (``) and `$()` within volume labels.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command injection: When a removable device with a specially crafted label containing shell metacharacters is mounted, the device notifier attempts to execute the label as a shell command when accessed via the notification panel.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary command execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the user mounting the removable device. In the reported case, a device labeled with "`touch blabla`" resulted in the creation of a file named "blabla" in the user's home directory.
- System compromise: If the attacker is able to place a malicious removable storage device with a specially crafted volume label, they can potentially gain control of the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Mounting a removable device (USB drive, external hard drive, etc.) with a malformed disk label containing shell metacharacters (` or $()) on a vulnerable system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs physical access or the ability to provide a specially crafted storage device to the target system. The user must then mount that device.
- The attacker needs the ability to create a removable device with a malicious label.
- The attacker must be able to trigger the vulnerable code path in the notification panel, specifically when a user attempts to access the device via the notification panel.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was present in the `plasma-workspace` package.
- The issue was triggered when opening a volume from the notification panel, but not when opened directly through the Dolphin file manager.
- The fix involved using `KMacroExpander::expandMacrosShellQuote` to properly quote device paths, preventing the shell from interpreting the malicious characters as commands.
- The fix was backported to the stable branch, not just a new version.
- The vulnerability affected KDE Plasma versions up to at least 5.10.5.
