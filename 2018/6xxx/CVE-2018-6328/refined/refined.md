    "source": "www.exploit-db.com_0f5f9c32_20250125_103327.html",
    "vulnerability": {
      "Root cause": "The api/storage web interface in Unitrends Backup (UB) before 10.0.0 does not properly validate input parameters, allowing for authentication bypass and arbitrary command execution.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation",
	"SQL Injection",
        "Authentication bypass",
        "Command injection"
      ],
      "Impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the target system.",
      "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the /api/storage or /api/hosts endpoint with a SQL injection payload in the AuthToken header and a malicious command injected into parameters.",
      "Required capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the Unitrends UEB web interface (port 443). They can be unauthenticated."
    },
	"details": "The exploit uses a SQL injection in the AuthToken to bypass authentication. Then, it injects a malicious command into a parameter such as `hostname` in the /api/storage endpoint or `ip` in the /api/hosts endpoint. The commands are executed with root privileges in older versions of the software (UEB 9) and with limited privileges in newer versions (UEB < 10.1.0). The exploit uses `cmdstager` to upload and execute a payload."

    "vulnerability": {
      "Root cause": "The Unitrends UEB 10.0 has an unauthenticated root remote code execution vulnerability due to improper input validation in the API.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "SQL injection",
        "Authentication bypass",
        "Command injection",
	 "Remote Code Execution"

      "Required capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the Unitrends UEB web interface (port 443). They can be unauthenticated."
    },
   "details": "The exploit uses a SQL injection in the AuthToken to bypass authentication and gain low priv RCE by running netcat to open a bind shell on the target. It then transfers a python privesc script to the target which contains the final command that the user specifies in the exploit."
