Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2018-6064:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a type confusion flaw in the V8 JavaScript engine, specifically within the `ElementsAccessorBase::CollectValuesOrEntriesImpl` method.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Type Confusion:** The code does not properly handle changes to the elements kind of an object during the execution of `CollectValuesOrEntriesImpl`. Getters can modify the object's structure mid-loop, leading to incorrect type assumptions later in the code, particularly within `GetEntryForIndexImpl`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This means an attacker can gain control over the application.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** As noted by Exploit-DB, this type of flaw could lead to a DoS condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web Browsing:** The primary attack vector is through a malicious web page or file. The user needs to either visit the malicious page or open the malicious file using the vulnerable browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote and does not need physical access to the target system.
- **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction. The target must be lured into visiting a malicious website or opening a malicious file.
- **JavaScript Knowledge:** The attacker needs to craft malicious JavaScript code to trigger the type confusion. This code needs to leverage the way the V8 engine handles array elements and their getters.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability occurs because the `CollectValuesOrEntriesImpl` function iterates over the keys of an object to collect values or entries. Inside the loop, a getter can be defined for an array index. This getter can then modify the array, causing the elements kind to change, which can cause the `GetEntryForIndexImpl` to use incorrect data leading to a type confusion.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was identified by lokihardt of Google Project Zero.
- It is related to a broader set of security issues fixed in Chrome 65.0.3325.146 and similar updates in other browsers, specifically within the V8 JavaScript engine.
- Red Hat issued RHSA-2018:0484 to address this and other vulnerabilities in `chromium-browser`.
- Debian also issued DSA-4182-1 to fix this issue along with several others.
- Exploit-DB provides a proof-of-concept (PoC) that shows how to trigger the type confusion through JavaScript.
- This vulnerability was also exploited during a Pwn2Own competition on Xiaomi Mi6 devices.

In summary, CVE-2018-6064 is a critical vulnerability that could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by exploiting a type confusion flaw in the V8 engine when processing JavaScript code within a web browser. The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted getter and changes to the elements kind of the array, leading to type confusion in subsequent operations.
