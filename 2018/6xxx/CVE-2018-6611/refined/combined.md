# libopenmpt security update 0.3.6

2018-02-03

The OpenMPT/libopenmpt project released the latest stable libopenmpt version:

## libopenmpt 0.3.6 (2018-02-03)

* [**Sec**] Possible out-of-bounds memory read with malformed STP files.
  (r9576)
  ([CVE-2018-6611](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-6611))
* [**Bug**] Small memory leak with malformed STP files.
* STM: Accurate emulation of Scream Tracker 2 tempo mode.
* STM: Better support for early format revisions (no such files have been
  found in the wild, though).
* Fine volume slides are now supported when seeking with seek.sync\_samples=1
  enabled.

<https://lib.openmpt.org/doc/changelog.html> .
