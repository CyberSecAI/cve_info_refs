Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6611:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by insufficient bounds checking when processing loop data within malformed Scream Tracker Project (STP) files. Specifically, the code did not properly validate `info.loopStart`, `info.loopLength` and `smp.nLength` leading to out-of-bounds memory access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds memory read:** A malformed STP file with crafted loop data could cause the program to read beyond the allocated buffer for sample data.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The code lacked proper validation to ensure that loop start and length values did not result in accessing memory outside of the sample buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Reading out-of-bounds memory could potentially expose sensitive information, such as other parts of memory. This is specifically called out in the text "out-of-bounds memory read"
- **Crash:** While not explicitly stated in the provided content, out-of-bounds read can lead to application crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Parsing:** The vulnerability is triggered by loading and processing a specially crafted STP file.
- **Malformed File Input:** The attacker needs to create a malformed STP file containing specific crafted loop data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malformed STP file to the vulnerable application. This means an attacker needs to be able to cause the vulnerable application to load a malicious STP file, either by getting a user to load it, or if the application automatically loads the file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was identified using afl-fuzz, a fuzzing tool.
- The fix involves adding checks to validate `info.loopStart`, `info.loopLength` and `smp.nLength` to prevent out-of-bounds read.
- A small memory leak with malformed STP files was also addressed in the same fix.
- The fix is implemented in the `soundlib/Load_stp.cpp` file.
- The vulnerability was fixed in libopenmpt version 0.3.6.
- The vulnerability does not affect earlier libopenmpt 0.2 branch.
