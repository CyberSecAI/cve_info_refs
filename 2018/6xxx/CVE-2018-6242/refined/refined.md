- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A vulnerability exists in the NVIDIA Tegra Recovery Mode (RCM) of older Tegra-based processors. This vulnerability allows bypassing secure boot.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the Tegra RCM which can be exploited to bypass secure boot mechanisms. This is likely due to missing or flawed checks in the RCM implementation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute unverified code on the affected device.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack requires physical access to the device and the ability to connect to its USB port.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs physical access to the affected device and knowledge of how to interact with the Tegra RCM via the USB port.

The document provides more detail than the CVE description, specifying that the vulnerability affects older Tegra-based processors but not Tegra X2 and later SOCs like Xavier and that GPUs are not affected. It clarifies that remote exploitation is not possible and that physical access is required.
