Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6532:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Icinga 2 HTTP server's lack of proper input validation, allowing attackers to send specially crafted requests which could exhaust server memory. This was possible due to the lack of size limits on HTTP headers and body, as well as missing authentication checks for requests with body.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Unrestricted HTTP Request Sizes:** The HTTP server did not enforce limits on the size of HTTP headers or bodies, allowing for large requests to consume excessive memory.
*  **Missing Authentication Checks:**  The server was processing the request body even before authenticating the API user. Unauthenticated requests were also allowed, which could lead to abuse by external attackers.
*   **Null Pointer Dereference:** There was a potential for a null pointer dereference, though the provided content doesn't describe exactly where it is.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  By sending large or numerous requests, an attacker could exhaust the server's memory, triggering the operating system's Out-of-Memory (OOM) killer and causing a service disruption or crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning the attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by sending requests to the Icinga 2 server. Both authenticated and unauthenticated requests could be used, but authenticated ones could have a higher impact.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the Icinga 2 server to send HTTP requests.
*   **No Privileges Required:** The vulnerability could be triggered by both authenticated and unauthenticated users, requiring no special access privileges.
*   **No User Interaction Required:** The attack does not require any user interaction to be successful.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix involved adding validation for HTTP connection sizes, setting limits on HTTP header size and body size, ensuring the user is authenticated before parsing the request body, adding timeouts for TLS handshakes and fix request closing.
*   The fix includes specific limits on HTTP body size for different API endpoints. For most endpoints, a 1MB limit is set, with some allowing up to 512MB for specific config and object modification operations.
*   The fix was backported and included in Icinga 2 version 2.8.2.
*   The pull request #6103 provides detailed commits, discussions, and code changes related to the fix.
