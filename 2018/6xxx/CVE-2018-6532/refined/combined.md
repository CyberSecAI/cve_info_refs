# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Spelling, either all use "in" or standard English grammar "Max body size in MB". In that case "Support Filters" would need to be changed too.

Is there a particular reason why these calculations use 1028 instead of `1 << 10 == 2 ** 10 == 1024`?

Not really, we can change that. But is it that much faster?

Oh, I think you misunderstood. It's not about performance (the compiler is likely to do the computation at build time anyway) and instead about power of two being the basis for [Mebibyte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mebibyte). 1028 isn't a power of two.
