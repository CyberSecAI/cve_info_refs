The provided content mentions a presentation by Sam Granger at BSidesRDU 2018 titled "When it rains it pours". The presentation discusses uncovering "several critical security vulnerabilities" in a smart irrigation system using basic testing tools and techniques.

Based on the content:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The presentation highlights security flaws in a popular smart irrigation system, but the specific root cause isn't detailed in this text. It is mentioned that these are "basic security flaws", and that these flaws were found with basic testing tools and techniques.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The content states "several critical security vulnerabilities" exist within the smart irrigation system. The type of vulnerabilities are not specified, but they are described as basic.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** The content does not explicitly describe the impact, but given the phrase "critical security vulnerabilities", it suggests the potential for significant impact. This could include unauthorized control of the irrigation system, denial of service, or other impacts associated with IoT device vulnerabilities.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is not explicitly defined, but it can be inferred it involves interacting with the smart irrigation system, likely through network access.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The presentation implies that basic testing tools and techniques were sufficient to uncover the flaws, suggesting a relatively low barrier to entry for attackers. Access to the network the irrigation system is on would be required, at a minimum.

This content provides more context than a typical CVE description, as it describes the discovery process. However, without further details, the specific vulnerabilities remain unknown.
