Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**CVE-2018-6311**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient physical access control. The UART interface on the device's motherboard lacks any software protection, and the root account does not have a password.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Lack of authentication on the UART interface.
    *   Root account has no password.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Full system compromise (root access).
    *   Potential for disclosure of user communications.
    *   Code execution.
    *   Denial of service.
    *   Escalation of privileges.
    *  Information Disclosure
*   **Attack Vectors:** Physical access to the device's UART pins on the motherboard.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Physical access to the device and ability to connect to the UART pins

**CVE-2018-6312**

*   **Root Cause:** A privileged account with a weak default password, combined with the ability to enable telnet remotely.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Weak default password for a privileged account (foxconn).
    *   Ability to enable TELNET service through the web interface.
    *   Telnet service allows root login without a password
    *   CWE-521: Weak Password Requirements
    *   CWE-284: Improper Access Control
    *   CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Full system compromise (root access).
    *   Potential for disclosure of user communications (including IPsec keys to decrypt communications).
    *   Code execution.
    *   Denial of service.
    *   Escalation of privileges.
    *  Information Disclosure
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Remote access via the web management interface.
    *   Brute-force or dictionary attack on weak default credentials.
    *   Enabling Telnet through web interface and logging in as root without password.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Network access to the device's web interface, ability to perform password attacks, and ability to enable Telnet.

**Additional Notes:**
* The identified device is a Foxconn femtocell (FEMTO AP-FC4064-T) used by Asia Pacific Telecom (APTG).
* The vulnerabilities were discovered by CFL Lab.
* The vendor was notified and has patched the vulnerabilities.
* The vulnerabilities apply to all devices using the same firmware.
* The content provides more details than a typical CVE description, including a Proof of Concept (POC) and details of the attack process.
