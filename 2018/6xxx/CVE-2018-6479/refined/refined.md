The provided content is related to CVE-2018-6479.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Netwave IP Camera server is vulnerable to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack due to its inability to handle a large POST request.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of proper input validation and resource management when processing POST requests. Specifically, the server does not check the size of the incoming POST request body.
- The vulnerability is present in any firmware of the Netwave IP camera server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation results in a denial of service, rendering the IP camera unresponsive.
- The device gets stuck and stops streaming audio and video.
- The camera is rendered unavailable, disrupting its intended function of physical security and control.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based.
- An attacker sends a single, large POST request to the root path of the camera's web server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the target IP camera server. This implies network access to the device.
- The attacker does not need any authentication to perform the attack. The vulnerability is unauthenticated.
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
