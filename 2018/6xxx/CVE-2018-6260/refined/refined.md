Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-6260:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a side channel exposed by GPU performance counters in the NVIDIA graphics driver.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is that the GPU performance counters, which are meant for monitoring and performance analysis, can be leveraged to gain access to sensitive application data processed on the GPU. This constitutes an information disclosure vulnerability through a side-channel attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a local attacker to access application data processed on the GPU. The confidentiality of the processed data is compromised. There is no indication that the integrity or availability of the system is directly affected.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is local, meaning that the attacker must have direct access to the system. The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Access:** The attacker must have local user access to the system.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker requires user interaction.
- **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to understand and exploit the side-channel through the GPU performance counters.
- **Timing Precision:** The exploitation may involve measuring and analyzing the behavior of performance counters with some level of precision.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is not a remote or network attack vector.
- The CVSS v3 score for the vulnerability is 2.2 (Low).
- The vulnerability was reported by Hoda Naghibijouybari, Ajaya Neupane, Zhiyun Qian, and Nael Abu-Ghazaleh.
- NVIDIA addressed this issue with driver updates. Specific versions are provided in the text for both Windows and Linux (including FreeBSD and Solaris).
- After installing the security update more action is required to restrict access to GPU performance counters through the NVIDIA Control Panel Help or Linux driver Readme.
