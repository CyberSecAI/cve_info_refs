Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the issue:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted input file that causes the GPP (likely a program or tool) to attempt to allocate more memory on the stack than is available. This leads to a stack overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Stack Overflow:** The core weakness is a stack-based buffer overflow. The program does not properly validate or limit the amount of memory it allocates on the stack when processing a crafted input file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate impact is a denial of service. The program crashes due to the stack overflow, making it unavailable for further use.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Potential):** The issue mentions a potential for remote code execution in specific situations. Stack overflows can, in certain circumstances, be exploited to overwrite return addresses and execute arbitrary code. However, the details needed for RCE are not provided in this description.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Malicious Input File:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing the program a specifically crafted input file ( `poc_gpp.txt`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Ability to Provide Input:** An attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted input file to the vulnerable program. This could be via a command-line argument, file upload, or any other means of providing file input.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided content is from a GitHub issue page. The content is more detailed than a typical CVE description, including the name of the vulnerable program (GPP), an example input file, and potential impacts like RCE.
*   The issue states that GPP will try to use more memory than available on the stack, which clarifies that the vulnerability is a stack overflow rather than heap overflow.
