Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability exists within the SMS extension module of WUZHI CMS 4.1.0. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input within this module, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The primary weakness is the failure to sanitize user-provided input before storing it. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the system.
*   **Insecure Handling of `<details>` Tag:** The exploit uses the `ontoggle` attribute of the `<details>` HTML tag to execute JavaScript. This indicates a lack of filtering or escaping of HTML tags and attributes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser when they view the affected page.
*   **Session Hijacking/Cookie Stealing:** An attacker could use the injected script to potentially steal user cookies or session tokens, leading to account compromise.
*   **Defacement or redirection:** The attacker may alter the page, redirect the user to another site or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Input:** The attacker injects the malicious payload within the vulnerable field/parameter within the "SMS in station" module settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Access to the CMS backend:** The attacker needs access to the CMS backend to configure the vulnerable SMS module's settings.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable module:** The attacker needs to identify the specific vulnerable module (SMS in station)
*   **Ability to provide malicious input:** The attacker needs the capability to input the malicious JavaScript payload.

**Technical Details:**
*   The provided POC uses the `<details/open/ontoggle=eval(String.fromCharCode(97)+String.fromCharCode(108)+String.fromCharCode(101)+String.fromCharCode(114)+String.fromCharCode(116)+String.fromCharCode(40)+String.fromCharCode(50)+String.fromCharCode(41))>`. This snippet uses `String.fromCharCode()` to construct the `alert(0)` JavaScript code which will be executed when the `<details>` element is toggled open.
*  The screenshots provided show the injection points and the resulting alert being triggered, confirming the presence of the vulnerability.

**Summary:**
This content provides more details than a typical CVE description by providing the specific location of the vulnerability (the SMS extension module), the method of exploitation, and an example of a malicious payload. This is a classic stored XSS vulnerability where user-supplied input is not properly sanitized, resulting in the execution of arbitrary scripts in a user's browser.
