  "summary": "The vulnerability is a use-after-free that occurs due to the lack of object validation before performing operations, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code. It is triggered when handling certain objects in Foxit Reader, requiring user interaction via malicious pages or files. Additionally, the application is vulnerable to use-after-free when handling AcroForms, checkbox, or 3D page objects due to use of wild or freed pointers."
