        "source": "www.zerodayinitiative.com_a30caa58_20250125_154056.html",
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists due to a lack of validation of an object's existence before performing operations on it within the handling of the gotoURL method of a host object.",
         "weaknesses": [
           "Use-After-Free"
         ],
        "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.",
        "attack_vectors": "Remote attackers can exploit this by tricking a user into visiting a malicious webpage or opening a malicious file.",
         "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious PDF file or host a malicious website to deliver the exploit to the victim.  User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability."

         ],
        "impact": "Attackers could leverage the use-after-free vulnerability to execute remote code.",
        "attack_vectors": "The attacker would need to craft a malicious PDF file with specific elements to trigger the use-after-free condition.",
         "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious PDF file and induce a victim to open it. The specific object types that trigger the vulnerability may require specific expertise to create a working exploit."

     "summary": "The provided content describes a use-after-free vulnerability in Foxit Reader related to the handling of the gotoURL method. The vulnerability can be triggered by user interaction and allows for remote code execution. It also provides additional details of another vulnerability, specifically that of use-after-free in several objects within Foxit Reader that could also lead to remote code execution."
