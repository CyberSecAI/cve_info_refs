{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The DDNS module saves configuration data into a file. By sending a POST request with a long string value in a specific JSON key (username), an overflow occurs when the data is saved. This overflow corrupts the DDNS module configuration file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Buffer overflow in DDNS module configuration file handling",
    "Lack of input validation for JSON key values"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The overflow can crash the inetd task, stopping most network services, including http, dns and upnp.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the router's DDNS configuration interface.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface (typically on the local network). They also need to know the correct password to obtain a valid stok value"
