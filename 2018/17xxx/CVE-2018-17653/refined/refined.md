    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of the resolveNode method of a TimeField. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of validation of the existence of an object before performing operations on it within the handling of the `resolveNode` method of a TimeField.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Use-After-Free"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution in the context of the current process.",
    "attack_vector": "Remote attacker, User interaction (target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file).",
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious PDF file or webpage containing a malicious XFA document which triggers the vulnerability via the TimeField's resolveNode method.",
