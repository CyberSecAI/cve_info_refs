Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-17966:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a memory leak in the `WritePDBImage` function located in the `coders/pdb.c` file of ImageMagick. Specifically, the allocated memory for `runlength` in line 846 is not freed when `AcquireQuantumInfo` fails and throws a `ResourceLimitError` in line 871.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Leak:** The primary vulnerability is a memory leak. A failure to free dynamically allocated memory when exiting the function via exception, leads to the leak.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Repeated exploitation of this memory leak can lead to a denial-of-service condition as the application consumes more and more system memory, eventually leading to crashes or system instability.
- Potential for further issues, although not detailed in these sources, memory leaks can often lead to more complex security problems, depending on the application's specific behaviour with memory.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  The attack vector involves providing a specially crafted image file in PDB format that triggers the vulnerable code path in `WritePDBImage`.
- An attacker can potentially trigger this vulnerability by tricking a user or automated system into processing a malformed PDB image file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted PDB image file to a system using ImageMagick that processes such files.
- This could involve tricking a user into opening the file or exploiting an application that automatically processes images, without sanitizing the input.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability was fixed in ImageMagick versions 7.0.7-29 and 6.9.9-40.
- The Ubuntu security notice (USN-4034-1) mentions this vulnerability as one of several fixed in an ImageMagick update. It also notes a policy change disabling Postscript and PDF support in ImageMagick for certain Ubuntu versions due to issues with GhostScript, although this change was a mitigation for other vulnerabilities.
-  Red Hat has also acknowledged and tracked this vulnerability (Bug 1636587) with a low severity rating, noting that it affects RHEL 5,6 and 7 and that RHEL 5 and 6 will not be fixed.

The provided information gives specific code locations within the `WritePDBImage` function where the memory leak occurs, offering more detailed insight than what might be provided by a basic CVE description.
