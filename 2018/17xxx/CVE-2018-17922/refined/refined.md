- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The PAP credentials of the device are stored in clear text in a log file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficiently protected credentials (CWE-522).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can retrieve the clear text credentials, bypass authentication, and gain access to critical information.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote access to the log file containing the credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Network access to the device. Low skill level is required to exploit.
