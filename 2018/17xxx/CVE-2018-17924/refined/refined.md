- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authentication for critical function. The affected devices allow unauthenticated CIP connection requests to be made, allowing modification of the IP configuration.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing authentication allows unauthorized modification of device configurations. Specifically, sending a new IP configuration to the device, even when in Hard RUN mode.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to a loss of communication between the device and the rest of the system. The attacker can overwrite the IP address, causing disruption.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote network-based attack. The attacker sends a malicious CIP connection request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Unauthenticated, remote attacker. Low skill level required to exploit.
