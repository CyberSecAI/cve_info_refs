  "CVE-2018-17626": {
    "Description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of the Validate events of TextBox objects. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to the lack of validation of the existence of a TextBox object before performing operations on it during the handling of Validate events.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-After-Free vulnerability due to missing object existence validation."
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current Foxit Reader process.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Visiting a malicious web page",
       "Opening a malicious file."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious PDF file or website that triggers the vulnerability. The victim needs to open the malicious PDF file or visit the malicious website for exploitation.",
     "Additional Information": "The Zero Day Initiative advisory mentions that Foxit has released an update to address this vulnerability.  The CVSS score is 7.8, with an attack vector of Local (AV:L), a low attack complexity (AC:L), and a requirement of user interaction (UI:R). The confidentiality, integrity, and availability impacts are all high (C:H/I:H/A:H)"
