Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the relevant information regarding vulnerabilities in payment terminals:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Insecure Configurations and Default Passwords:** Many vulnerabilities stem from the failure to change default passwords for maintenance modes, allowing unauthorized access.
*   **Legacy Code and Software:** Older, proprietary operating systems used in some terminals contain buggy legacy code, weak cryptographic schemes, and vulnerable protocols.
*   **Lack of Secure Boot:**  Boot processes in many terminals lack robust secure boot implementations, allowing for manipulation of the boot chain.
*   **Insecure Maintenance Software:** Some maintenance software uses clear text protocols, hardcoded credentials, and lacks proper security measures, making it vulnerable to interception and manipulation.
*   **Exposed Debug Interfaces:** Debug interfaces, intended for development, are sometimes left exposed and can be abused by attackers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** Usage of default/hardcoded passwords for maintenance modes and FTP servers.
*   **Insecure Protocols:** Usage of clear text protocols (like FTP) for communication with the terminals.
*   **Weak Cryptography:** Use of weak cryptographic schemes for firmware updates and data protection.
*   **Buffer Overflows and Logical Flaws:** Presence of buffer overflows and other logical flaws in the operating system kernels.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Ability to achieve arbitrary code execution due to vulnerabilities in bootloaders, maintenance modes, or through shell command injection.
*   **Bypass of Security Measures:** Bypassing tamper detection mechanisms, update signature checks, and role-based access controls.
*   **Unsigned Code Execution:** Running unsigned code due to exploitable vulnerabilities.
*   **Exposed JTAG Interfaces:** Some devices have exposed JTAG interfaces that could be used for debugging and exploitation.
*   **Proprietary File System:** Proprietary file systems can complicate analysis and security testing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Theft:**  Capture of sensitive payment card data (PAN, expiration date, etc.) via compromised EMV/NFC interfaces.
*   **PIN Disclosure:** Potential to disclose PINs entered by customers on the device, although this is protected by hardware measures.
*   **Financial Fraud:** Manipulation of transaction amounts or processing fraudulent payments.
*   **Device Compromise:**  Full compromise of the payment terminal, enabling the attacker to run arbitrary code.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Control of the device remotely to exfiltrate sensitive data or install malicious software.
*   **Fake POS Systems:** Creation of fake POS systems which process payments without authorization, routing the money to attacker-controlled accounts.
*   **Skimming Attacks:** Stealing card data with a skimming device or malicious software installed on the terminal.
*   **Relay Attacks:** Intercepting and relaying card data to bypass contactless payment security.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical Access:**  Disassembling the device to access debug interfaces and tamper detection circuits.
*   **Network Attacks:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in network protocols used for communication with the terminal.
*   **USB Interface:** Using the USB interface to access maintenance modes, upload malicious firmware, or intercept communication.
*   **EMV/NFC Interface:** Manipulating or intercepting EMV/NFC communications to steal card data or perform fraudulent transactions.
*   **Supply Chain Attacks:**  Compromising devices before they reach merchants through malicious software or hardware modification.
*   **Software Exploits:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the OS, bootloader, and applications of the payment terminals.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Access:**  Requires physical access to the payment terminal to perform hardware modifications or connect debugging tools.
*   **Technical Expertise:**  Requires knowledge of reverse engineering, embedded systems, cryptography, and network protocols.
*   **Programming Skills:**  Ability to write code to exploit vulnerabilities and develop custom firmware.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker might need to be on the same network as the terminal for certain types of exploits.
*   **Access to Maintenance Tools:** The attacker needs access to the vulnerable maintenance software or methods of triggering debug modes.
*   **Patience and Resources:**  Some of the vulnerabilities require a significant amount of time and resources to exploit.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The research highlights vulnerabilities across multiple vendors, including Ingenico, Verifone, and PAX.
*   The researchers found that default passwords and lack of security configuration are widespread issues.
*   Many of the discussed vulnerabilities were found using reverse engineering and analysis of firmware.
*   The presentation mentions a list of CVEs that were discovered during the research. However, the exact CVEs are not mentioned in this document, and this document is not related to the specified CVE.
