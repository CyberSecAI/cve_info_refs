# What's New

**NOTE:** Beta features should not be installed and are not supported on production systems. Beta modules have been provided for evaluation in lab environments only.

| **Zimbra Collaboration Suite:**  * Added ChangePrimaryEmailRequest to zmprov to change the primary email address of an account while keeping the existing account active as an alias, with no account outage. ([Bug 104915](https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=104915)) * Hierarchical Address Book (Beta) - An Hierarchical Address Book (HAB) is an enhancement of the Global Address List (GAL) that includes organization information, enabling contact selection by sub-organization and seniority. This initial Beta gives administrators the ability to add and view organizational data from the Linux console. |
| --- |
| **Zimbra Connector for Outlook:**  * Office365 - Official Support for Microsoft's subscription-based Office365 desktop Outlook 2016 installation. * Outlook 2019 (Beta) - Microsoft released Office 2019 on 24 Sept 2018. ZCO has been updated and tested for compatibility with the 2019 Preview. The Beta designation will be updated based on our testing with the official release, now in progress. * Issue Reporting improvements, phase I - This feature aims to reduce TCO and improve support by helping to obtain more complete information about problems earlier. Phase I expands user's log file file management capabilities, and introduces the ability to securely share compressed logs with administrators via Zimbra Briefcase. |
| **Zimbra Docs:**  * Zimbra Docs integrates with Zimbra Drive V2 (Beta). * On LOOL Server, enabled file logging on information level by default, created the directory /opt/zimbra/log/when installing docs. * With Zimbra in http-only mode but using an external reverse proxy for https, docs will now use the zimbraPublicServiceProtocol attribute and redirect to the appropriate URL. In all previous versions, Docs was unusable in this configuration. |
| **Backup NG:**  * All NG operations now allow optional synchronous operation and result feedback, by using --sync which waits for the operation to complete and returns a 1 or 0 exit code.   + The --sync flag works similarly to --progress, but without the feedback.   + If both flags are set, --progress has higher priority. * Ensure that **Archive** accounts can be restored when mailbox licenses are fully utilized. Previously, the inability to create these accounts could fail a restore or migration operation. |
| **Mobile NG:**  * Fixed handling of ActiveSync requests with deviceID=0. In the Zimbra Admin Web Interface, under ZeXtras -> ZxMobile, a new device is added under the 'Registered Devices'. The new device has 0 as 'Device ID'. In case of ABQ Strict or Interactive; the device will stay in the dummy mailbox until a new DeviceID is set (there is no way to manually allow the client). The log information about the cluster entry state has been reduced. |
| **HSM NG:**  * No change. |
| **NG Admin Console:**  * The admin zimlet now points to the documentation of the version used, instead of "latest". |
| **Zimbra Chat:**  * Fixed Visualization problem with file shared via chat. |
| **Zimbra Drive:**  * No change. * Zimbra Drive is compatible with:   + [NextCloud](https://nextcloud.com/changelog) versions 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 only (See NextCloud store for latest.)   + [ownCloud](https://owncloud.com) versions 9.0, 9.1, and 10 only |
| **Zimbra Talk:**  * Incorporated documentation for [Zimbra Talk V2](https://zimbra.github.io/adminguide/8.8.10/index.html#_zimbra_talk_v2) into Zimbra Admin Guide. |

| Known Issues | |
| --- | --- |
| ZCO | Older versions of the Outlook Connector for ZImbra (prior to Version 8.8.10) do not detect versions 8.8.10 and higher, so users will receive no notification that an upgrade is available. End users are recommended to initiate a manual upgrade to this version of the connector. |
| ZCO | A user may experience an Outlook crash while sharing Inbox, Calendar, Contacts or Task folder when either ZCO client machine is disconnected from the internet Or if Zimbra Collaboration Server(ZCS) is down. |
| ZCO | If a new ZCO profile is created while search indexing is in process for a previously existing ZCO profile, the new profile may be improperly linked to the index for the old profile. This may be resolved by restarting the Windows search: If Outlook search doesn’t work, Exit from the Outlook and restart 'Windows Search Service' or restart 'Search Protocol Host' process. Affected versions: 8.8.8 and later. |
| ZCO | On a Windows PC hosting multiple user accounts, some users may not be able to "Create a new Zimbra Profile" when ZCO has been previously installed on a click-to-run Outlook version. Users may encounter this situation after their PC is migrated from Workgroup network model to Domain based model, as the SSO / Domain user is different than the local Workgroup user. For more information, see [(<https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/index.php?curid=23757> KB 23757]. |

# HttpClient Overview

The Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is perhaps the most significant protocol used on the Internet today. Web
services, network-enabled appliances and the growth of network computing continue to expand the role of the HTTP
protocol beyond user-driven web browsers, while increasing the number of applications that require HTTP support.

Although the java.net package provides basic functionality for accessing resources via HTTP, it doesn't provide the full
flexibility or functionality needed by many applications. HttpClient seeks to fill this void by providing an efficient,
up-to-date, and feature-rich package implementing the client side of the most recent HTTP standards and recommendations.

Designed for extension while providing robust support for the base HTTP protocol, HttpClient may be of interest to
anyone building HTTP-aware client applications such as web browsers, web service clients, or systems that leverage or
extend the HTTP protocol for distributed communication.

## Documentation

1. [Quick Start](quickstart.html) - contains a simple, complete example of an HTTP GET and POST with parameters.
2. HttpClient [Tutorial](./current/tutorial/html/) ([PDF](./current/tutorial/pdf/httpclient-tutorial.pdf))
3. [HttpClient Examples](examples.html) - a set of examples demonstrating some of the more complex use scenarios.
4. [HttpClient Primer](./primer.html) - explains the scope of HttpClient. Note that HttpClient is not a browser. It
   lacks the UI, HTML renderer and a JavaScript engine that a browser will possess.
5. Javadocs

   * [HttpClient](./current/httpclient/apidocs/)
   * [HC Fluent](./current/fluent-hc/apidocs/)
   * [HttpMime](./current/httpmime/apidocs/)
   * [HttpClient Cache](./current/httpclient-cache/apidocs/)
   * [HttpClient Windows extensions](./current/httpclient-win/apidocs/)
6. API compatibility reports

   * [HttpClient](./current/httpclient/clirr-report.html)
   * [HC Fluent](./current/fluent-hc/clirr-report.html)
   * [HttpMime](./current/httpmime/clirr-report.html)
   * [HttpClient Cache](./current/httpclient-cache/clirr-report.html)
   * [HttpClient Windows extensions](./current/httpclient-win/clirr-report.html)
## Features

* Standards based, pure Java, implementation of HTTP versions 1.0 and 1.1
* Full implementation of all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS, and TRACE)
  in an extensible OO framework.
* Supports encryption with HTTPS (HTTP over SSL) protocol.
* Transparent connections through HTTP proxies.
* Tunneled HTTPS connections through HTTP proxies, via the CONNECT method.
