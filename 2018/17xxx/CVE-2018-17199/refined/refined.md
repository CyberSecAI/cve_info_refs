Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2018-17199:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `mod_session` module of the Apache HTTP Server. Specifically, the session expiry time is checked *before* the session is decoded.  Because the expiry time information is part of the encoded session data, the check is ineffective and the session expiry is ignored for `mod_session_cookie` sessions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Session Expiry Handling:** The core issue is the faulty logic within `mod_session`, which checks session expiry before decoding the session cookie.  This leads to the expiry time being ignored for `mod_session_cookie` sessions.
* **Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Issue:** The module is performing a check, but the check is invalidated by the subsequent decoding process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypassing Session Expiry:** By exploiting this flaw, a user can effectively bypass the configured session expiry time. This could lead to an extended session lifetime beyond what was intended, increasing the window of opportunity for attackers to hijack sessions.
*   **Information Disclosure:** If a session contains sensitive data, the extended session lifespan could prolong the time this data is vulnerable to compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:** Attackers would typically target web servers running a vulnerable version of Apache with `mod_session` enabled.
*   **HTTP Requests:** The attack would likely involve crafting or manipulating HTTP requests to bypass the session expiry mechanism.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
*   **Understanding of `mod_session`:** The attacker should be familiar with the inner workings of the Apache `mod_session` module and session cookie usage in order to exploit the flaw.
*   **Existing Session Cookie:** The attacker must possess or be able to obtain a valid session cookie.

**Additional Notes:**
* Multiple sources confirm this vulnerability affects Apache HTTP Server versions up to and including 2.4.37.
*   The fix involves correcting the order of operations within `mod_session`, ensuring that the session expiry time is checked *after* the session has been decoded.
*   Some Red Hat resources also mention a fix for the related CVE-2018-17189 and other HTTP/2 vulnerabilities (CVE-2019-0196, CVE-2019-0217, CVE-2019-0220).
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Medium" or "Low", according to various sources.
*   Several references list affected products from various vendors, and also provide information on fix availability.
