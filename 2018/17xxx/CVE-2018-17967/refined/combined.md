| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1636590#c0)  Laura Pardo    2018-10-05 19:41:07 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in ImageMagick 7.0.7-28. A memory leak vulnerability in ReadBGRImage in coders/bgr.c which could lead to a Denial of Service attack.   References: <https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/1051>  Upstream Patch: <https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/commit/53060aa22a3767a46a9ddb4ef32e7fa061a1da34>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1636590#c1)  Laura Pardo    2018-10-05 19:41:40 UTC  ``` Created ImageMagick tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1636591](show_bug.cgi?id=1636591 "CLOSED RAWHIDE - CVE-2018-17967 ImageMagick: memory leak in ReadBGRImage in coders/bgr.c. [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1636590#c2)  Stefan Cornelius    2018-11-27 17:16:02 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of ImageMagick as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.  This issue did not affect the versions of ImageMagick as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is now in Maintenance Support 2 Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle. This has been rated as having a security impact of Low, and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/>.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1636590#c3)  Paul Harvey    2019-01-26 09:46:07 UTC  ``` openshift-enterprise-3: This has been rated as having a security impact of Low. Affected OpenShift containers will inherit fixes once they land in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 packaging and containers are rebuilt. Removed openshift-enterprise-3 from whiteboard.   ``` |  |
