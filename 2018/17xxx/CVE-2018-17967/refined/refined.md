Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-17967:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a memory leak in the `ReadRGBImage` and/or `ReadBGRImage` functions within the `coders/bgr.c` file of ImageMagick. Specifically, the issue arises when `AcquireQuantumInfo` fails after memory for `canvas_image` is allocated, leading to a leak of the allocated `canvas_image`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Leak:** The code allocates memory for `canvas_image` but fails to free it when `AcquireQuantumInfo` returns NULL, resulting in a memory leak.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Repeated exploitation of this memory leak can lead to excessive memory consumption, potentially causing the application to crash or become unresponsive, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves processing specially crafted image files that trigger the vulnerable code path in `ReadRGBImage` or `ReadBGRImage` resulting in the memory leak.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted image file as input to ImageMagick to trigger the vulnerable code path and cause the memory leak. No special privileges are required.

**Technical Details:**
- The github issue #1051 provides the code snippet which illustrates the memory leak. In the code:
```c
canvas_image=CloneImage(image,image->extract_info.width,1,MagickFalse,	//line 159, allocation for canvas_image
    exception);
  if(canvas_image == (Image *) NULL)
    ThrowReaderException(ResourceLimitError,"MemoryAllocationFailed");
  (void) SetImageVirtualPixelMethod(canvas_image,BlackVirtualPixelMethod,
    exception);
  quantum_info=AcquireQuantumInfo(image_info,canvas_image);
  if (quantum_info == (QuantumInfo *) NULL)
    ThrowReaderException(ResourceLimitError,"MemoryAllocationFailed");		//line 167, memory leak as not free canvas_image
```
- The allocation of memory for `canvas_image` is done in line 159, and the failure of `AcquireQuantumInfo` at line 167 results in a resource leak as `canvas_image` is not freed.
- The Red Hat Bugzilla entry indicates that the vulnerability is located in `coders/bgr.c` and that it is a memory leak, confirming the github issue report.
- The vulnerability affects ImageMagick versions up to 7.0.7-28, and was fixed in versions 6.9.9-40 and 7.0.7-29.
