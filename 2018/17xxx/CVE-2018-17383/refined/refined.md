Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-17383

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the `filter_order` and `filter_order_Dir` parameters within the Joomla! Component Collection Factory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The component is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user-supplied input being directly incorporated into SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exposure/Manipulation:** Successful exploitation can lead to the ability to read, modify, or delete sensitive data stored in the application's database.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:**  An attacker could potentially use the SQL injection to gain further access to the server/system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request containing malicious SQL code within the `filter_order` and `filter_order_Dir` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla! instance.
- **No Authentication Required:** The provided proof-of-concept does not suggest that the attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable URL parameters:**  The attacker needs to know the URL parameters vulnerable to injection (`filter_order`, `filter_order_Dir`).

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit example provided shows how to inject a SQL query into the `filter_order` parameter using the `EXTRACTVALUE()` function. This function is used in MySQL to extract data from XML documents.  The crafted SQL code attempts to retrieve database user, database name, and database version information.

**Vulnerable Component:**
- Joomla! Component Collection Factory version 4.1.9

**Additional Notes:**
- The extension has been unpublished from the Joomla! Extensions Directory due to broken links.
