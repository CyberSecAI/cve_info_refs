Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-17215

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Improper Certificate Validation:** Postman performs server certificate validation and displays an error if the certificate is invalid. However, it proceeds to send the HTTP request regardless of the validation failure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Bypass of Certificate Validation:** Although Postman detects invalid certificates, it does not halt the transmission of the request, thus bypassing the intended security measure of certificate validation.
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** The vulnerability leads to the exposure of sensitive data contained in the HTTP request, such as user credentials, which are sent to the server even with an invalid certificate.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** An attacker performing a MitM attack can intercept the HTTP request sent by Postman even if the server certificate is invalid.
*   **Data Leakage:** User credentials and other sensitive information within the request are disclosed to the attacker during a MitM attack.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle:** The attacker needs to be positioned in the network path between the Postman client and the target server.
*   **Invalid Certificate:** The attacker presents an invalid or self-signed SSL/TLS certificate to the Postman client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Positioning:** The attacker must be in a position to intercept network traffic between the Postman client and the server.
*   **SSL/TLS Spoofing:** The attacker must be capable of presenting an invalid certificate to the client, e.g., through a proxy or by acting as the server.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided PoC demonstrates how the HTTP request is still sent, including the `Authorization` header containing credentials, even when the certificate is invalid and an error is displayed.
* The advisory also indicates that the vendor was notified, and a patch was released after initial contact and a follow-up reminder.
