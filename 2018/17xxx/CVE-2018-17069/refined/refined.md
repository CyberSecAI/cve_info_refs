Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of these vulnerabilities is the lack of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in the UNL-CMS application. Specifically, the application does not properly validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to trick a logged-in user's browser into making unauthorized requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
1.  **CSRF vulnerability for content creation:** The application is vulnerable to CSRF attacks when creating new content through the `node/add/article` endpoint. The provided proof-of-concept (POC) demonstrates how a malicious website can send a forged POST request to this endpoint, leading to the creation of unwanted content.
2.  **CSRF vulnerability for website settings update:** The application is also vulnerable to CSRF attacks when updating the website settings through the `admin/config/system/site-information` endpoint. The provided POC shows how an attacker can use a malicious website to submit a forged POST request and modify website settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Content Creation CSRF:** An attacker could use this vulnerability to create unwanted content on the website, potentially injecting malicious scripts or defacing the site. This could lead to reputational damage, malware distribution, or other malicious activities.
*   **Website Settings Update CSRF:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can modify the website settings. This could allow them to change the site name, slogan, default email, or redirect the site to a different page. This could lead to a complete takeover of the website or damage the website's functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector for both vulnerabilities is through a malicious website or email containing crafted HTML. The attacker would lure a logged-in user to visit this malicious page. The browser, authenticated to the vulnerable application, would then execute the attacker's forged request, leading to the unauthorized actions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website or send emails with malicious HTML.
*   The targeted user needs to be logged into the vulnerable UNL-CMS application in the same browser session while visiting the malicious page.

**Technical Details (from the provided POCs):**

*   **Content Creation POC:** The attacker crafts a HTML page that sends a `POST` request with form data containing the title, body, and other necessary fields, simulating the action of creating a new article. The `XMLHttpRequest` object is used in this case.
*   **Website Settings Update POC:** The attacker crafts an HTML form that sends a `POST` request containing modified site settings like `site_name`, `site_slogan`, etc. This leverages a standard HTML form submission.
