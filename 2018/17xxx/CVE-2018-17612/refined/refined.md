- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Sennheiser HeadSetup software installs a self-signed certificate into the local machine's trusted root certificate store. In older versions, the private key for this certificate is stored in the installation folder, encrypted with a hardcoded key and passphrase, making it easily accessible. This allows an attacker to forge trusted certificates. Newer versions use a different approach, introducing a root CA certificate, but the TLS server certificate's private key is also stored in the installation folder.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Insecure storage of the private key for the self-signed certificate in older versions of HeadSetup.
    - Installation of a self-signed root CA certificate into the trusted root store.
    - The TLS server certificate and its private key are the same across all installations
    - Lack of removal of the root CA certificate during uninstallation or update.
    - Short expiry of the TLS server certificate in newer versions.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - **Older versions:** An attacker can create forged certificates that are trusted by the system, enabling man-in-the-middle attacks, impersonation of legitimate websites or software publishers and signing malicious software.
    - **Newer versions:** An attacker can reuse the TLS server certificate to impersonate the legitimate local secure web socket.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - **Older versions:**
        - Gaining access to the HeadSetup installation folder to extract the private key.
        - Performing a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept network traffic.
    - **Newer versions:**
        - Gaining access to the HeadSetup installation folder to extract the private key of the TLS server certificate.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - **Older versions:** The attacker needs access to the HeadSetup installer or a system where HeadSetup 7.3 or prior version was installed, and the ability to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
    - **Newer versions:** The attacker needs access to the HeadSetup installation folder and the ability to perform a man-in-the-middle attack targeting the local secure web socket.
