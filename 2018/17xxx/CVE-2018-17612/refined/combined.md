Introduction

The Trusted Root CA certificate store is the list of entities issuing certificates – e.g. for TLS
servers or software publishers – that are trusted by the specific client system and whose
certificates are generally accepted by the local system. It is in most cases maintained by the
respective browser or operating system vendor (see e.g. [MS-TRCP2018]) adhering to the
regulations of the CA/Browser Forum [CABF-BR2018]. Any trustworthy communication
carried out by this local client – and, from a more general perspective, the backbone of
trusted communication all over the Internet.

However, even though the trust system relies on the automatic management of the therein
hold certificates, it remains possible for administrators and – unless administratively
prohibited – users to delete or add certificates in the Trusted Root CA store of their systems.
In spite of everything, the content of this store ought to be regularly inspected and controlled
– something that users rarely find the time for doing so.

Upon such a rare inspection of the Trusted Root CA store, we stumbled across two
unexpected root certificates. The issuer names in these two certificates indicated that they
have a connection to the Sennheiser HeadSetup utility software installed on our systems in
conjunction with the connected headsets of this manufacturer.

We found that – caused by a critical implementation flaw – the secret signing key of one of
the clandestine planted root certificates can be easily obtained by an attacker. This allows
him or her to sign and issue technically trustworthy certificates. Users affected by this
implementation bug can become victim of such a certificate forgery, allowing an attacker to
send e.g. trustworthy signed software or acting as an authority authorised by Sennheiser.

2

Background

The Sennheiser HeadSetup SDK supports the use of a locally connected headset by web-
based softphones in a browser, loaded from a server web site via HTTPS.

According to [Senn2018], the way HeadSetup supports this application scenario is by
opening a local secure web socket (WSS) through which the headset can be accessed from
within the browser.

According to Sennheiser, the browser must be able to access this local web socket through a
trusted HTTPS connection in order to bypass cross origin resource sharing (CORS)
restrictions implemented by relevant browsers. Hence, the HeadSetup SDK needs a locally
trusted TLS server certificate issued to the localhost IP address1 (127.0.0.1) and the
associated private key.

3

Vulnerability Remediation Status

Sennheiser was informed about this vulnerability in advance, is aware of the vulnerability
impact and started working on an updated version of HeadSetup to resolve the issue.
According to the developers, this process will take a while.

Nonetheless, we decided to publish information about the vulnerability and recommended
mitigations as scheduled because an attacker looking at the right spot may find and exploit it

1

Theoretically, the IPv6 localhost address or a valid DNS host name of the local system might be
used in alternative to 127.0.0.1. However that would have no effect on the issue that we
subsequently describe.

with ease. On the other hand, simple and effective mitigations for end users are available
(see 7.2) and should be implemented in the meantime.

Sennheiser announced the release of an updated version of HeadSetup no later than week
48/2018 (end of November 2018). The updated software will remove critical certificates and
ensure that installed certificates are deleted as part of the uninstallation process. For users
who do not regularly update their HeadSetup software, a script will be made available on the
Sennheiser website that uninstalls the most vulnerable certificate.

HeadSetup Behaviour

4.1  Older Version

The following behaviour can be observed in HeadSetup version 7.3.4903 (henceforth
referenced as version 7.3 or “older version”). Potentially the same behaviour is also exhibited
by several earlier and/or a few later versions.

HeadSetup 7.3 uses a single private/public key pair and associated certificate, which is
identical for all installations of the software. The private key is stored in a file named
SennComCCKey.pem and the certificate in a file named SennComCCCert.pem, both located
in the HeadSetup installation folder, see Figure 1.

The certificate is self-signed. It uses issuer and subject name including a common name
(CN) component 127.0.0.1 and is marked as a CA certificate in the standard certificate
extension BasicConstraints, see Figure 2 and Figure 3. It is marked as valid until January 13,
2027.

Despite its designation as CA certificate, the HeadSetup software employs it as the TLS
server certificate for the local secure web socket. In order to turn it into a trusted credential,
the HeadSetup installer pushes the certificate into the local machine2 trusted root certificate
store of the Windows system on which it is installed.

Note that the HeadSetup installer must run with local administrator privileges. Once the
installing user confirms3 the installation of the software there is no further system prompt
warning about the addition of the certificate to the trusted root store and displaying the
certificate’s fingerprint, like there would be if this root certificate were added manually.

4.2  Newer Versions

The following behaviour can be observed in HeadSetup versions 7.4.5601 and 8.0.6108
(henceforth referenced as version 7.4 respectively 8.0 or “newer versions”). Potentially the
same behaviour is also exhibited by a few earlier and/or several later versions and any
version in-between 7.4 and 8.0.

HeadSetup newer versions use two certificates:

a)  A self-signed CA certificate using CN SenncomRootCA, marked as valid until July 28,

2037 and stored in a file named SenncomRootCA.cert.pem in the HeadSetup
installation folder.
The vendor supposedly keeps the private key associated with this certificate under
custody.

b)  A TLS server certificate using CN 127.0.0.1, issued by the SenncomRootCA, valid until
December 22, 2018 and stored in a file named 127.0.0.1.crt.pem in the HeadSetup
installation folder.
The associated private key is stored in a file named 127.0.0.1.key.pem in the
HeadSetup installation folder.

Both these certificates and, of course, associated keys are identical for all installations of the
software.

The HeadSetup software employs the latter certificate as the TLS server certificate for the
local secure web socket. In order to turn it into a trusted credential, the HeadSetup installer
pushes the SenncomRootCA CA certificate into the local machine trusted root certificate
store of the Windows system on which it is installed.

Note that – like for the older versions– the HeadSetup installer must run with local
administrator privileges and once the installing user confirms the installation of the software
there is no further system prompt warning about the addition of the certificate to the trusted
root store and displaying the certificate’s fingerprint, like there would be if the root certificate
were added manually.

2

3

Under Windows, the local machine trusted root store is also trusted by any user while she or he
is logged on to that particular machine.

The HeadSetup installer carries a valid Authenticode signature by Sennheiser Communications,
using a code-signing certificate issued by a public commercial trust center, which is displayed
during the attended installation. That code-signing certificate has nothing to do with the
vulnerability at hand.

4.3  Update or Removal of the Software

During an update from the old version to a newer version the certificate and key files
containing the old version certificate and key in the HeadSetup installation folder are deleted
and replaced by the newer version certificate and key files.

During removal (de-installation) of the HeadSetup software the complete HeadSetup
installation folder – including certificate and key files – is deleted.

However, in neither case any of the CA certificates added to the local machine trusted root
store during the installation or update process is removed.

5

Risk Assessment

5.1  Older Version Approach

Adding a Trusted Root CA certificate is a severe vulnerability, if a potential attacker has
access to the associated private key. Such an attacker can issue forged certificates at his or
her own discretion that will be automatically validated as valid and hence trusted on the
affected vulnerable system.

In the case of the HeadSetup Software the root CA private key is potentially accessible to
any user that has or ever had access to the HeadSetup 7.3 installer executable or an
installed version, since it is stored in the SennComCCKey.pem key file.

Moreover, since the certificate is not removed from the trusted root certificate store during
update or removal of the software, every system on which HeadSetup 7.3 was installed at
any time in the past – and every user on such a system – remains vulnerable. This
vulnerability persists until the CA certificate expires in 2027 or one of the mitigations
recommended in section 7 becomes effective.

Possible Attacks, where such a forged/valid certificate could be employed include, but are
not limited to the following two examples:

Read and modify the complete session of the victim with any seemingly secure HTTPS
web server

The attacker might issue a TLS server certificate for an arbitrary server name or wildcard
(e.g. CN=*.google.com) for a key under her or his control and install that in a man-in-the-
middle system pretending to be the original secure web server which the victim on a
vulnerable system wants to access.
Unless the browser implements a key/certificate pinning as an additional security measure
– like some versions of Chrome do with regard to certificates for Google servers – the victim
will not notice the man-in-the-middle attacker.

Send the victim malicious software or provide with a download link to malicious
software seemingly coming from an arbitrary well-known software publisher

The attacker might issue a code-signing certificate for an arbitrary, well-known software
publisher name (e.g. CN=Microsoft Corporation) for a key under her or his control and
use that certificate to code-sign an installer executable containing malware.
If a victim on a vulnerable system opens that installer she or he is (in many cases, depending
on local policy configuration) presented a prompt indicating the well-known software
publisher as source of the executable and will more likely proceed with the installation of the
software than if “Unknown Publisher” or an unexpected publisher name were indicated.

Secorvo Security Consulting GmbH

Note that in both exemplary attacks a connection the Sennheiser would hardly be noticed by
an unsuspecting victim:
The victim would have to inspect the HTTPS server certificate respectively code signing
certificate in a detail level that shows the root certificate to which the certificate in question is
linked. Depending on the application, this requires anything from two to five additional,
supposedly unnecessary clicks on buttons and options that are not commonly well-known.
Hence, it is safe to assume that an overwhelming percentage of users will not perform such
an inspection.

5.2  Newer Version Approach

In the newer version approach, there is no direct way for an attacker to create valid
certificates under the new SennComRootCA CA certificate, since vendor supposedly keeps
the private key associated with that CA under custody.

However, there is no published information about the policies according to which the
SennComRootCA operates, such as a CP or CPS, nor any third party audit of its security
and trustworthiness. Hence, users can only hope that Sennheiser Communications follows
PKI best practices regarding the security and trustworthy operation of its CA.

In contrast to that, any CA that is pre-installed in a browser or operating system through
programs such as [MS-TRCP2018] must publish a CP and CPS fulfilling the requirements of
the CA/Browser Forum, in particular [CABF-BR2018], and prove their compliance with these
requirements through a yearly audit report by an independent accredited auditor.

Therefore, we consider the risk that an attacker might fraudulently obtain a certificate
significantly higher for the SennComRootCA than for other pre-installed Root CAs or their
respective Sub CAs.

Additionally, [CABF-BR2018] strictly prohibits trust centers operating under one of the
preinstalled Root CAs to issue TLS server certificates for non-routable IP addresses like
127.0.0.1. If an attacker needs a valid certificate for this address as one step of a multi-
layered attack, he or she could not legally obtain it from a public trust center. However, such
an attacker could directly (ab-)use the HeadSetup TLS server certificate and the associated
private key, which will be valid on any system that ever had a newer version of HeadSetup
installed.

Furthermore the – in comparison to the older version approach – significantly shorter validity
of the TLS server certificate results in a potential availability risk.
The vendor can push out a new TLS server certificate through its update channel only. If
certain users do not regularly update or do not install the respective upcoming update in time
– to be precise: before the current TLS server certificate expiry on December 22, 20184 –
their web-based softphones will no longer be able to connect to their headphones through
the local HTTPS web socket.

Summarized, the vulnerability introduced by the newer version HeadSetup software is
significantly less severe than in the older version. There are however some remaining risks in
this approach; see section 7.1 for a recommended solution that avoids these remaining risks.

Incidentally, this date is the last Saturday before the Christmas holidays. So many users would
probably not notice the effect of the certificate expiry before early January 2019.

5.3  CVE-2018-17612 and CVSS Score

This vulnerability is assigned the unique identifier CVE-2018-17612.

Due to the fact that any system on which the older version was ever installed remains
vulnerable despite later updates or removal of the software, we rate the vulnerability
according to the risk assessment of the HeadSetup 7.3 software.

The CVSS vector string is

CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L/E:F/RL:W/RC:C

resulting in a CVSS Base Score of 7.5.

6

PoC Exploit

This section describes how we exploited the vulnerability introduced by HeadSetup 7.3 as
proof-of-concept.

6.1

Extraction of the Private Key

The SennComCCCert.pem file contains the CA (and server) certificate of the older version
software in the directly usable OpenSSL PEM format.

However, despite its name, the SennComCCKey.pem file is not a directly usable OpenSSL
RSA key. Upon inspection, it is obviously base64-endoced. After decoding the resulting
binary file starts with the characters Salted_. That file prefix indicates that the file was
symmetrically encrypted using OpenSSL.

In order to decrypt the file we needed to know the encryption algorithm and key that the
manufacturer used for encryption. Our first guess was that the vendor employed the common
AES encryption algorithm with 128-bit key in CBC mode. In the HeadSetup installation
directory, we found only one piece of executable code that contained the file name
SennComCCKey.pem, a DLL file named WBCCListener.dll. We searched for “AES” in the
strings contained in this DLL. The result is shown in Figure 4: there is indeed the algorithm
identifier aes-128.cbc. We found the key that the vendor used in close proximity to that
algorithm identifier, stored in clear in the code.

After AES decryption, the SennComCCKey.pem file becomes a standard OpenSSL PEM
format RSA private key file, where the key is protected by an additional passphrase. We
found that the passphrase was specified in the configuration file WBCCServer.properties
(see Figure 5) and additionally in the strings within WBCCListener.dll.

Knowing the AES key to decrypt the OpenSSL private key file and passphrase to access that
private key, we could use the standard OpenSSL command line to extract the CA certificate
and private key into a PKCS#12 file.

6.2  Creation of a Fraudulent Trusted Server Certificate

We imported the PKCS#12 file with the older version HeadSetup key and certificate into a
CA software (in our case XCA, however almost any other PKI CA software would work).
Then we created a new key pair and used our fraudulent CA to issue a wildcard TLS server
certificate for hosts in the domains of Google, Sennheiser and some of Sennheiser’s
competitors, see Figure 6.

Figure 6 Fraudulently issued certificate

As mentioned above several times, every system that ever had HeadSetup 7.3 installed will
validate this certificate as trusted until the year 20275.

6.3

Tools for Potential Abuse

To complete the exploit PoC, we imported the CA certificate and its associated private key
into a readily available man-in-middle attack tool, in our case mitmproxy6 and employed an
ARP spoofing attack to redirect the victim traffic to our attacker proxy.

When visiting a TLS secured site the victim browser reported the connection as secure (see
Figure 7) and the attacker was able to sniff and manipulate the whole connection.

6

In our PoC, we deliberately chose to limit the server certificate validity to 2020; we could of
course issue it with a validity date equal to the older HeadSetup CA certificate.

Recommendations

7.1  Recommended Solution the Original Issue

Our recommended solution to procure a locally trusted TLS server certificate for the local
secure web socket that eliminates all the described vulnerabilities is:

During installation of the software:

  Create a new public/private key pair that is individual for each installed instance of the

software.

  Create an associated self-signed certificate for CN 127.0.0.1 which is marked as TLS
server certificate, but not as CA certificate, using the respective standard certificate
extensions.

  Push that certificate to the local machine trusted people certificate store (not the trusted

root store).

Then the certificate will be trusted on the local machine, but cannot be used to issue other
valid (but fraudulent) certificates.

Depending on whether the software regularly runs with local administrative privileges, the
self-signed certificate can either be regularly renewed and the renewed certificate pushed to
the trusted people store. Or it can be issued for a validity period of multiple years during
installation. In both ways, the certificate renewal availability risk of the HeadSetup newer
version approach is avoided.

7

Note that the right half of the browser window, where “issued by 127.0.0.1” is indicated, is the
browser’s developer console that will not be displayed during regular use.

As an additional practical benefit, this solution would eliminate the effort for secure and
trustworthy operation of the SennComRootCA.

7.2  Risk Mitigation by Users

7.2.1

Individual Users

Individual users need local Windows administrator privileges to remove the CA certificates
added by the older and/or newer HeadSetup versions from the trusted root certificate store of
their machine. The certificates can either be deleted using the certificate management MMC
(on Windows 10: certlm.msc), by using PowerShell to access the certificate store
cert:LocalMachine\Root, or by issuing the following commands on the command-line:

certutil -delstore root "127.0.0.1"

certutil -delstore root "SennComRootCA"

Users who need the local web socket functionality for web-based softphones should update
HeadSetup to the newest version and only remove the older CA certificate
(CN=127.0.0.1). For all other users we recommend removing both certificates.

7.2.2

Active Directory Administration

In an Active Directory, the AD administrator can use a Group Policy to add one or both to the
“Untrusted Certificates” store of all AD-joined systems. The respective Group Policy setting
can be found in the Computer Configuration section of a suitable GPO under
Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Public Key Policies\
Untrusted Certificates, see Figure 8. One or both certificates must be imported to
that GPO branch.

After Group Policy renewal, these certificates will be listed in the local machine untrusted
certificates store of each system. This listing in the untrusted store has precedence, even if
the certificates remain in the trusted root certificate store.

Figure 8 Group Policy setting to distrust certificates

We recommend organizations who need the local web socket functionality for web-based
softphones to update HeadSetup to the newest version and distrust the older CA certificate
only. All other users should distrust both certificates.

7.3  Risk Mitigation by the Vendor

7.3.1

Warning and User Decision

Unless the vendor implements the recommended solution in section 7.1, any new version of
the HeadSetup software should warn the user during installation about the addition of a
Trusted Root CA and permit users who do not need the local web socket to skip this step.

7.3.2

Trusted Root Certificate Removal

Any future version of HeadSetup should remove the old version CA certificate from the
trusted root store, if present, during installation or update.

If the vendor implements the recommended solution in section 7.1, any future version of the
HeadSetup software should also remove the newer version CA certificate from the trusted
root store, if present.

Vulnerability Report
Secorvo Vulnerability Report HeadSetup 06.docx

Certificate Management Vulnerability
Sennheiser HeadSetup

Page 14 of 16
October 31, 2018

Secorvo Security Consulting GmbH

In all cases, any future version of HeadSetup should remove both CA certificates from the
trusted root store during de-installation.

7.3.3

Propagation as Untrusted via Microsoft Update

Since affected systems stay vulnerable even after removal of the HeadSetup software, any
mitigations provided by future versions of the HeadSetup software cannot mitigate the risk for
all affected users, in particular not for those users who will not install future versions.

Therefore, Sennheiser should contact Microsoft and request that the older version CA
certificate (CN=127.0.0.1) is pushed to the untrusted certificates store (see also section
7.2.2) of all Windows systems by the Windows Update mechanism.

Microsoft has done so before for certificates that were fraudulently obtained or CA
certificates of compromised CAs. In Windows 7, certificates in the untrusted store can be
examined by local users; in newer versions of Windows only the fingerprints of untrusted
certificates are stored.

7.4

Prevention of this Class of Vulnerabilities

The certificate management vulnerability described in this report was introduced during the
design phase of the HeadSetup software. In order to prevent this class of vulnerabilities, we
recommend the following generic steps:

  Documentation of a security concept for the software, independently reviewed before

starting the implementation.

  In an application software, middleware, or utility (i.e. everything except system software)
making changes to system-wide security settings such as fiddling with AD administrative
credentials or – in the case at hand – adding trusted Root CAs is to be avoided.

  If doing so is deemed absolutely necessary, an expert in the field should be consulted

before concluding the software design.
