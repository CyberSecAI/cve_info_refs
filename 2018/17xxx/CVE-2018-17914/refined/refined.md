Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2018-17914:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The `UniSoft.dll` contains a function that processes file paths. It concatenates a user-supplied file name to a base directory or copies it directly into a fixed-size buffer without validating the length.  This leads to a stack buffer overflow when the provided filename is excessively long.
*   **Empty Password in Configuration File:** The software allows for the configuration of a "Guest" account with no password, or the Main password being left blank. This, in conjunction with the ability to trigger the vulnerable functions via network messages, allows for remote exploitation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-121:** Stack-based buffer overflow in `UniSoft.dll` when processing file names.
*   **CWE-258:** Use of empty passwords for user accounts allowing unauthenticated access.
*   Lack of proper input validation for file names.
*   Unencrypted communication channel.
*   Insecure default configuration (no main password, guest account with no password).
*  Path traversal vulnerability

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Stack Buffer Overflow:** A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service (application crash) via a stack buffer overflow.
*  **Remote Command Execution:** Allows for execution of arbitrary commands on the remote host. The attacker can run code with the same privileges as the InduSoft Web Studio or InTouch Edge HMI runtime. This can lead to a complete compromise of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Messages:** The vulnerable function can be triggered by sending specifically crafted messages (command 67, function 15) to the server listening on port 1234.
*  **Path Traversal:** An attacker can use path traversal to execute commands outside of the intended application directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the target system where InduSoft Web Studio or InTouch Edge HMI is running.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities without authentication if no main password is set or if a Guest account with an empty password exists.
*   **Low-Privilege User:** A low privileged user with permission 1 can trigger the stack buffer overflow.

**Additional Details:**

*   The Tenable advisory provides a detailed proof-of-concept exploit for the stack buffer overflow and remote code execution.
*   The vulnerability is present in `UniSoft.dll`.
*   The advisory mentions that the vulnerabilities were discovered while developing a Nessus plugin for CVE-2018-10620.
*   AVEVA has released security updates to mitigate these vulnerabilities (InduSoft Web Studio v8.1 SP2 and InTouch Edge HMI 2017 SP2).
*   AVEVA recommends enabling strong passwords for accounts and enabling encrypted communication channels.
*  While a path traversal vulnerability was found, it is noted that the vendor did not directly patch it, but mitigated its impact through increased authentication by default.

**Summary of CVE-2018-17914:**

CVE-2018-17914 specifically relates to the vulnerability of *Empty Password in Configuration File*, which allows an unauthenticated user to execute code with the same privileges as the affected software. This was achieved by sending specific network messages that would then trigger a path traversal vulnerability, or by exploiting the stack overflow described in CVE-2018-17916
