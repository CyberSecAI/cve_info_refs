Specifically, the advisory from the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) provides details about this vulnerability.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability exists within the handling of the `exportData` method of a host object in Foxit Reader.  The core issue is that the software does not validate the existence of an object before performing operations on it.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n*   Use-After-Free vulnerability.\n*   Lack of input validation, particularly for object existence before dereferencing it.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n*   Remote code execution; an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user process.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n*   A remote attacker needs to entice a victim to either visit a malicious web page or open a specially crafted malicious file.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n*   The attacker can be remote and does not require any special privileges on the victim's system.\n*   User interaction is required. The user must open a malicious file or visit a malicious webpage."
