Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerabilities:

**CVE-2018-17102:**

*   **Root Cause:** The provided content indicates a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The application lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can change an administrator's password.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that submits a password change request to the vulnerable application.
    *   The attacker then tricks a logged-in administrator into visiting the malicious page, which triggers the password change request.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious web page.
    *   The attacker must be able to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting the attacker-controlled page while the administrator is logged into the vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes**

The issue #199, includes a proof-of-concept (POC) HTML code snippet that demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability to change the administrator's password. The form uses hidden input fields to specify the new password.

**Issue #187**

*   **Root Cause**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the admin account creation functionality.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities**: Lack of CSRF protection allows an attacker to create arbitrary user accounts by sending malicious requests.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**: An attacker can create new admin accounts without the knowledge or consent of the application administrator.
*   **Attack Vectors**:
    *   The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page that contains a form submitting a request to create a new user account.
    *   The attacker tricks a logged-in administrator into accessing the malicious webpage which results in creation of an unauthorized account.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious web page.
    *   The attacker must trick a logged-in administrator into accessing the malicious page.

**Additional Notes**
The issue #187 includes a POC HTML code snippet that shows how to create a new account named "test" with a password "testtest".

The two issues describe two distinct CSRF vulnerabilities in the same application. Issue #199 allows password modification while #187 allows creation of accounts.
