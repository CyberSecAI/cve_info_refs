The provided content is related to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, but it is **not** related to CVE-2018-17140. The exploit targets the "Quizlord" WordPress plugin, while the CVE is for something else.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Quizlord plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'title' parameter when adding a new quiz.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the quiz title.
- When a user views the quiz (either directly or embedded in a post/page via shortcode), the malicious script will execute in their browser. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - User redirection to malicious sites
    - Defacement of the website
    - Other malicious actions within the context of the victim's session

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker with access to the WordPress admin panel can create a quiz with the malicious payload in the title field.
- The malicious script is stored in the database
- Any user who views the quiz where the shortcode is embedded will be affected.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be logged in as a user with access to the Quizlord plugin, which typically requires administrator or editor level privileges.
