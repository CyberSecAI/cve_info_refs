Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-17195:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content directly relates to CVE-2018-17195. The provided information includes:
    -  The CVE ID is explicitly mentioned as the title in the vulnerability section from nifi.apache.org
    -  The description aligns with the official CVE description of a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the template upload resource.
    -  The provided github content contains the patch commit and associated discussion

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) protection on the template upload API endpoint. This allowed requests from different domains, when combined with ARP spoofing and man-in-the-middle attacks, to perform actions on behalf of a user.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The primary vulnerability is the susceptibility to CSRF attacks. The template upload API endpoint did not validate the origin of the request, which could be exploited by a malicious website to trigger unwanted actions (template upload) on a NiFi instance.
- **Lack of CORS Policy:** The absence of a proper CORS policy allowed requests from arbitrary origins to interact with the template upload endpoint.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Unauthorized Template Uploads**: Attackers could upload malicious templates to the system, potentially introducing harmful configurations or code.
-   **Compromised System Integrity:** The malicious templates could potentially modify the system configuration or even inject code that could lead to broader system compromise.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

-   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM):** An attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and modify network traffic (MITM) between the user and the NiFi instance, using techniques like ARP spoofing.
-   **Malicious Website:** The attacker also needs to inject malicious code into a website that the targeted user visits. This website can then trigger the CSRF attack.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Network Proximity**: The attacker needs to be on the same subnet as the targeted user to perform ARP spoofing.
-   **MITM Capabilities**: Ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests.
-   **Social Engineering**: The attacker needs to trick the user into visiting a malicious website.
- **Client certificate authentication**: Requires the targeted instance to utilize client certificate authentication, which is usually on a private network
-   **Unprotected HTTP website**: In order for the malicious website to execute the attack, the user has to visit an unprotected website (no https) to trigger the attack

**Additional Information:**

-   The vulnerability was addressed by applying a CORS policy to the template upload endpoint.
-   The vulnerability was considered "Critical" due to the potential damage and even though the exploitability was "complex"
- The fix was released in Apache NiFi 1.8.0
