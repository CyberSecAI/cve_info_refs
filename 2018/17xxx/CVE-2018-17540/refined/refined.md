  "CVE-2018-17540": {
    "description": "The gmp plugin in strongSwan before 5.7.1 has a Buffer Overflow via a crafted certificate.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Integer underflow in a length check leading to a heap buffer overflow.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation when verifying RSA signatures in the gmp plugin.",
        "Integer underflow vulnerability caused by insufficient key length validation.",
         "Heap buffer overflow vulnerability when writing the signature encoding."
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of service due to crash of the IKE daemon. Potential for remote code execution is not ruled out, but it's considered difficult to achieve due to the nature of the data being written to the buffer.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending a crafted certificate to the IKE daemon.",
          "Exploitation can be triggered when x509 plugin parses a certificate to check if it is self-signed using a public key with a small modulus.",
          "A malicious peer can trigger the vulnerability by sending a crafted certificate during IKE authentication."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to craft a malicious X.509 certificate with a small modulus.",
        "affected_components": [
          "The gmp plugin of strongSwan."

    "affected_products": [
      "strongSwan versions prior to 5.7.1"
    ],
        "suggested_action": "Upgrade to strongSwan 5.7.1 or later. Apply the provided patch for older releases if upgrade is not possible."
