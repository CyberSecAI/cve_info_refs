  "summary": "The provided content describes a Use-After-Free vulnerability in Foxit PhantomPDF, triggered by improper handling of the username property of a TextField (first source) or when handling AcroForms or 3D page objects (third source). This can lead to arbitrary code execution if a user opens a specially crafted PDF or visits a malicious web page. The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper object validation before performing operations on it."
