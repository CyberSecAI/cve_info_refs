[00:28] hello
[00:29] this is point-of-sale terminal security
[00:31] uncovered
[00:32] my name is alexis stanikov i am hardware
[00:34] researcher and i'm going to talk about
[00:36] payment hardware security
[00:39] when i started this research i faced to
[00:41] the lack of useful information
[00:43] related to these kind of devices
[00:46] all vendors still keep in secret they
[00:48] are technologies used in such
[00:50] hardware because of many reasons point
[00:53] of sale terminal
[00:54] security is still a blind spot
[00:57] this talk is a combination of two years
[00:59] of research related to payment devices
[01:02] which handles your payment card data
[01:05] i am going to present general approach
[01:07] to understand the internals of hardware
[01:09] common weaknesses and
[01:11] additionally some of our results so
[01:14] let's start
[01:18] as you can see this presentation divided
[01:20] to two main parts
[01:22] hardware and software every topic in
[01:25] this list could be separate talk but i
[01:27] tried to highlight the most important
[01:29] things for each of them
[01:32] at the first step we have to understand
[01:34] that the post system is not equal to
[01:36] post terminal
[01:38] basically positive cell terminal or pin
[01:40] pad is a part of point of sale system
[01:43] or just a standalone device also point
[01:46] of sale system may have a register
[01:49] which in most cases built on windows
[01:51] based pc
[01:52] additional hardware like a barcode
[01:54] scanners
[01:55] and can be integrated to erp systems
[01:59] often when you see the title like
[02:01] someone hacked a post
[02:02] it means hack of register or
[02:06] cashier workstation let's look at
[02:09] typical data flow in such systems
[02:11] to define entry points for intruder
[02:14] this is typical point of sale
[02:16] interaction scheme
[02:18] what can go wrong in this case as you
[02:21] can see pin pad has two kind of
[02:23] interactions
[02:24] first one is an interaction with
[02:26] terminal management system
[02:28] and payment processor through the
[02:31] internet
[02:32] second one is an interaction with point
[02:34] of sale application using local network
[02:38] communication channel between the pin
[02:40] pad and third-party application or
[02:42] point-of-sale application can be
[02:44] configured in two different ways
[02:46] secure and insecure
[02:49] attack in this case is indifference
[02:51] between amount shown on pin
[02:53] pad and amount really charged from your
[02:56] card
[02:57] this is about vulnerable configuration
[03:00] but i want to pay attention to the most
[03:02] common thing in my
[03:04] talk just keep in mind to keep
[03:06] configuration as secure as
[03:08] possible if you are maintainer of such
[03:11] systems
[03:13] i am sure that you recognized at least
[03:16] two of these terminals
[03:18] first vendors are well known for united
[03:20] states and european countries
[03:22] and as far as i know pax is widely used
[03:25] in russia and
[03:26] asian countries because it's cheaper
[03:28] than previous two
[03:30] if you try to connect to pinpart via
[03:32] network connection
[03:33] you will be surprised there are no
[03:36] listening ports and
[03:37] one or two outcoming connections to some
[03:40] bank servers
[03:42] in this case you have to look at other
[03:44] physical ports
[03:45] the interfaces exposed to the intruder
[03:48] are basically attack surface
[03:50] they can be divided to general
[03:52] communication interfaces like
[03:55] ethernet rs-232 different wireless
[03:58] interfaces
[03:59] and specific payment card interfaces
[04:03] emv and nfc in some documentation you
[04:06] may find information
[04:07] that some of them are not used but in
[04:10] real life
[04:11] a protein system has drivers and
[04:13] handlers for some specific peripherals
[04:16] like barcode scanners and external
[04:18] receipt printers
[04:22] the next important thing is rules how
[04:24] the payment hardware should be built
[04:26] i know that regulation is a boring stuff
[04:28] but it may provide a lot of information
[04:30] about
[04:31] physical security tests and behavior
[04:33] every payment terminal should satisfy
[04:35] these requirements and regulations
[04:38] in any other cases it can be approved to
[04:41] work with payment
[04:42] data the first one is pinningto devices
[04:46] physical security requirements it
[04:48] defines protection measures
[04:50] against pin disclosing attacks like
[04:52] tamper detection response mechanisms
[04:55] and other cases for example if reader
[04:58] permits access to internal areas
[05:01] it is not possible using this access
[05:04] area to insert
[05:05] pin disclosing back also sensitive
[05:08] functions or information
[05:10] are only used in protected areas
[05:14] the next one is pin transaction security
[05:17] they are almost the same
[05:18] both have purpose to prevent pin
[05:20] disclosing
[05:23] these requirements also define tempo
[05:25] protection
[05:26] sensitive data horizon etc etc
[05:30] and what is the sensitive data is a
[05:32] question
[05:33] every vendor chose their own
[05:35] interpretation and way to erase
[05:39] let's have a look to common security
[05:41] mechanisms and
[05:42] anti-tampering according to previous
[05:45] rules and payment system requirements
[05:47] the following events should be
[05:49] registered like a case opening security
[05:52] circuit damage power supply anomalies
[05:55] also temperature
[05:56] anomalies accelerometer anomalies
[06:00] and finally debug interfaces connection
[06:05] two or more of them should be
[06:07] interpreted as intrusion
[06:09] as a result a terminal should lock the
[06:12] event or raising
[06:13] encryption keys delete sensitive
[06:16] information
[06:18] and finally become brick this slide
[06:21] shows you a
[06:22] tamper detection list we have extracted
[06:25] from
[06:26] ingenicatelium2 operating system code
[06:29] as you may see there are a lot of power
[06:31] supply detectors
[06:33] gtech connection detector and mechanical
[06:36] tempered detectors like
[06:37] meshes or switches let's look at each of
[06:41] them
[06:43] when you disassemble angenica pinpat you
[06:45] will see a lot of membranes switches
[06:48] some of them are assigned to real
[06:50] buttons like numeric and navigation
[06:52] buttons
[06:54] they are highlighted as green color but
[06:56] what are the red membranes
[06:59] they are mechanical type detectors they
[07:01] are pressed by the pin paired body when
[07:03] assembled
[07:04] when you start to rotate any screw in
[07:07] order to disassemble
[07:08] the microcontroller receives a hardware
[07:11] interrupt
[07:12] wakes up and do defined actions to
[07:15] protect its data
[07:17] another critical measure is a wire mesh
[07:20] as shown on this slide it has two main
[07:23] purposes
[07:24] anti-drilling protection and affordation
[07:26] case on this slide covers smart card
[07:29] reader
[07:29] and registers drilling when protection
[07:32] circuit is destroyed
[07:33] this kind of meshes you also may find on
[07:36] print circuit boards
[07:37] and ribbon cables and finally this is
[07:40] example of tempered devices
[07:43] as a result of our and finally this is
[07:47] example of tempered devices
[07:49] as a result of some of our attempts some
[07:52] of them became unusable
[07:54] and some of them asks you for factory
[07:56] password the main idea is when device is
[07:59] tempered it should be passed to servers
[08:02] basically only authorized service may
[08:04] restore the device
[08:06] and only bank servers can restore it and
[08:09] load the application
[08:11] and what consequences anti-tampering
[08:13] bypass may have
[08:15] one example related to mobile point of
[08:17] sale demonstrated on black hat
[08:20] united states the researchers realized
[08:22] that this device doesn't have any
[08:24] anti-tampering detectors
[08:27] they found points on circuit to connect
[08:29] in order to obtain
[08:30] encrypted max tribe data
[08:33] and finally it allows them to collect
[08:36] sensitive payment information directly
[08:38] from device
[08:40] another cool research made by sr labs
[08:42] and presented on ccc
[08:44] among their findings were anti-tampering
[08:46] bypass unlocked and exposed
[08:48] jtag connection and software
[08:51] vulnerabilities
[08:52] what you may do with such
[08:54] vulnerabilities we will discuss a bit
[08:56] later
[08:57] anywhere these finders compromised the
[08:59] world device
[09:01] and now it's deprecated
[09:05] another two examples related to the
[09:07] attacks and skimming
[09:08] you can read more using the links below
[09:12] and now it's time to talk about debug
[09:14] and maintenance
[09:15] features when you disassemble the point
[09:19] of sale terminal
[09:20] you realize that it is very complex
[09:23] device
[09:24] your imagination and background paint
[09:26] something like what you see on this
[09:28] slide
[09:29] because you know that the iphone for
[09:31] example has very specific jtag adapter
[09:35] in this case you can find some form
[09:37] topics about firmware uploading
[09:39] temporal clearing and related stuff
[09:43] but this is what you see in reality
[09:46] wherefore unpacks use the adapter from
[09:49] simple rf-232 to ethernet connector
[09:52] with custom wiring you can reproduce
[09:55] them yourself
[09:56] ingenica use just a usual usb port for
[09:59] firmware uploading and service actions
[10:02] these cables used for factory reset
[10:05] clear security flex
[10:06] upload firmware and sometimes for
[10:08] specific debugging
[10:10] but at the moment we still don't have
[10:12] firmware and don't know
[10:15] any information about architecture of
[10:17] microcontroller
[10:19] and now we should fill this gap teardown
[10:22] is my favorite step when i work with new
[10:24] hardware
[10:25] it delivers a lot of happiness to you as
[10:28] a favorite thing to all children is to
[10:30] broke new toy and see what
[10:32] do they have inside
[10:35] in the case if you already have the
[10:37] firmware it's good to understand the
[10:39] internals of hardware
[10:41] if you properly define the exact cpu or
[10:44] mcu
[10:45] it helps you to understand the operating
[10:47] system internals
[10:48] peripherals and other helpful things
[10:52] this is an example of old model made by
[10:54] verifone
[10:55] it built using samsung arm-based cpu
[10:58] you may read more about using a link
[11:01] below
[11:02] but our original friend
[11:05] this is an example of old model made by
[11:08] verifone
[11:09] it built using samsung car based cpu you
[11:12] may read more about
[11:14] using the link below but our region of
[11:17] interests
[11:17] is more modern devices this is the
[11:21] internals of
[11:22] modern warfare 520 here you can see the
[11:26] branded mcu and non-flash memory
[11:28] definitely this mcu should be relatively
[11:31] popular one
[11:32] but in this case it is rebranded it
[11:35] makes more difficult to understand the
[11:37] firmware internals
[11:39] in this case firmware could be dumped
[11:41] from non-flash memory using
[11:43] non-programmer
[11:45] luckily i found one guy in twitter who
[11:47] solved the same task
[11:50] he defined the exact model of mcu by
[11:52] pinot
[11:53] it was broadcom secure mcu bc m5892
[11:58] you can find header files with
[12:00] definitions of
[12:01] all peripherals in some linux kernel
[12:03] sources
[12:05] there are some other ways to determine
[12:07] the exact mcu
[12:09] and i am going to show one of them in
[12:11] next slides
[12:15] the next one is ingenico pin pad there
[12:17] is basically no difference
[12:19] is it portable or counter top they all
[12:22] build using the same hardware
[12:24] and uses the same operating system i
[12:26] sure it
[12:27] is well known for all of you you saw
[12:30] this photo on the slide with temporary
[12:32] detectors
[12:33] in this case pay attention to the
[12:35] microcontroller under the main brain
[12:39] it is branded crypto processor they
[12:41] called it booster in their binaries
[12:44] it stores the encryption keys inside and
[12:46] handles the most of critical
[12:48] cryptography
[12:49] tasks like updates signature checks and
[12:52] etc etc
[12:56] this is other site of print circuit
[12:57] board and you see another branded
[13:00] microcontroller they call it application
[13:03] processor according to its purpose
[13:06] exactly you can find any information
[13:08] about this microcontroller
[13:11] as in previous case flash memory in
[13:13] upper left corner store separating
[13:15] system and application codes
[13:20] you can desolder the flash memory in
[13:22] order to obtain
[13:23] the contexts
[13:28] you can disorder the flash memory in
[13:30] order to obtain a providing system and
[13:32] application code for research
[13:34] in this case is good to know the exact
[13:36] mcu to
[13:37] understand work with peripherals and
[13:40] other peculiarities
[13:42] one other important thing is flash
[13:44] contents you are going to dump is
[13:46] compressed
[13:47] you should solve unpacking tasks by
[13:49] yourself
[13:50] booster probably is one of atmel cortex
[13:54] m3mcu series but in a usual package
[13:58] i can't do anything in this case our
[14:01] laboratory
[14:02] and tools for decapin application
[14:05] processor looks like
[14:06] general purpose microcontroller and i
[14:08] tried to define the exact model
[14:13] this is another scenario to define mcu
[14:16] at the first step i desoldered this
[14:18] mcu and defined the exact package at the
[14:20] next step i made list
[14:22] of all microcontroller candidates for
[14:24] this package
[14:26] then i defined power supply pins by pcb
[14:29] used multimeter and filtered all unfit
[14:32] candidates by pin
[14:33] out the next thing you can see
[14:37] in testpad close to the microcontroller
[14:40] it may be interface used during
[14:42] production for factory flashing and
[14:44] setting up
[14:46] this hypothesis is confirmed by pull up
[14:48] resistor block
[14:50] the next list i made was pinout
[14:52] candidates at the moment i had
[14:54] list of microcontrollers only by
[14:57] microchip
[14:58] this list is on the slide
[15:01] and as a result i defined gtac pinout
[15:05] and i think the exact model is 1891
[15:10] sim9g20 tried to apply memory and
[15:13] register maps to our binaries and
[15:16] its feed but sadly the jtag
[15:20] is turned off the next case of pinpats
[15:23] is
[15:23] chinese pak's point of cell terminals
[15:26] they are very similar to verifone by
[15:29] their internals
[15:30] but it is completely different software
[15:33] inside
[15:34] when you disassemble one of them you
[15:36] will find
[15:37] the same microcontroller when you
[15:40] disassemble one of them you will find
[15:42] the same microcontroller and almost the
[15:45] same non-flash memory
[15:46] as used in all modern verifones
[15:50] none flash contains exposes to your
[15:52] encrypted and
[15:54] uncompressed binaries of proprietary
[15:56] operating system
[15:57] and application exactly the file system
[16:00] structure is proprietary
[16:04] now you can buy a couple of them from
[16:06] ebay for example and start your own
[16:08] payment hardware research
[16:12] and a few words about the tampering
[16:14] reset
[16:15] definitely all terminals have different
[16:17] ways to clear tampering flux
[16:20] some of them like packs uses simple
[16:22] hardcore passwords
[16:24] very fun models needed to upload dummy
[16:26] encryption keys to clear temporal flags
[16:29] and ingenica as far as i know storage
[16:31] security flux and keys
[16:33] in separate hardware controller and it
[16:36] can be reset
[16:37] using an external hardware also some
[16:41] forum topics contain the information
[16:43] about maintenance tampering clearing
[16:45] etc etc here you may see tips from
[16:50] closed russian forum about hard-coded
[16:52] passwords and special software
[16:54] the true way to understand all things
[16:57] related to tampering
[16:59] is reverse engineering
[17:02] what can you do if you can clear
[17:04] temporary flex
[17:06] for example when you cleared these flags
[17:08] you are able to upload the application
[17:10] again
[17:11] and play with the configuration
[17:14] you might write to write and upload your
[17:17] own firmwares
[17:18] tempo clearing may help you to restore
[17:20] after your experiments
[17:22] or use it opened in order to research
[17:24] internal interfaces using logical
[17:26] analyzer
[17:27] some of the pin pad are able to turn on
[17:30] some debug capabilities
[17:33] and in this case you can run any
[17:35] applications
[17:36] under the debugger now when we know some
[17:39] information about
[17:40] hardware and connections we should cover
[17:43] another blind spot
[17:44] payment card interfaces user payment
[17:48] method based
[17:49] upon a technical standard for smart
[17:51] payment cards
[17:52] in we originally stood for european
[17:54] mastercard and visa
[17:56] the three companies which created the
[17:59] standard
[18:00] in the most cases the hardware allows
[18:02] you to intercept
[18:03] and modify payment card data isn't cheap
[18:06] in this case we use the device called
[18:08] smart card detective with custom
[18:10] firmware
[18:12] now it's not supported by original
[18:14] developer
[18:15] but you can find the pcb and sources to
[18:18] assemble one for you
[18:20] here's a link with some information
[18:21] related to this device
[18:24] in order to understand emv packets you
[18:27] should read a bit
[18:28] about tagland value format
[18:31] then you should go to the official site
[18:34] of emv
[18:34] and you will be surprised by amount of
[18:37] information what you should read
[18:40] now you see some information available
[18:42] for download and related to emv
[18:45] every of these documents is very thick
[18:48] because it defines
[18:49] all things started from physical layer
[18:51] and deep description for every attack of
[18:54] emv
[18:56] i recommend you to read them briefly at
[18:59] least
[19:03] another interesting thing is nfc
[19:06] interface
[19:07] frame format is close to the emv but the
[19:10] physical layer is near field
[19:11] communication
[19:13] there are some approaches to start to
[19:15] work with nfc depends on your skills
[19:18] the most simple of them is proxmark
[19:21] another way is assemble your own sniffer
[19:23] or repeater based on
[19:25] some available stuff like pn532
[19:28] or trf-based board also you can use
[19:31] android device with nfc or something
[19:34] else that fits to your skills
[19:37] our assembly was pn532 based boards with
[19:40] raspberry pi zero
[19:42] it was cheap and dirty trick as you see
[19:44] but the components
[19:46] for it available literally everywhere
[19:50] and another batch of documentation now
[19:53] it is related to the nfc
[19:56] there are many decryptions of
[19:57] contactless payment transactions
[19:59] i also recommend read it briefly at
[20:02] least
[20:03] why is it important every payment
[20:05] interaction has
[20:06] its own handler and
[20:10] you are able to fast every attack and
[20:12] you will be surprised
[20:14] and now it's time to discuss the
[20:16] software and firmware part
[20:18] of point of sale terminals
[20:23] during our research we faced two
[20:25] different operating systems
[20:27] part of them was completely proprietary
[20:30] like verifone works
[20:32] sagintalium used by ingenico and
[20:35] paxos they all have legacy codebase
[20:39] proprietary binary format
[20:41] etc etc another part was
[20:45] linux based devices
[20:48] android devices in this case are out of
[20:50] our scope
[20:54] the first thing we have to understand is
[20:56] device boot order
[20:57] it also have a lot legacy because almost
[21:00] all of these operating systems
[21:02] developed before traditional secure boot
[21:05] approach became a main stream
[21:08] after we said zero stage bootloader
[21:10] should be started
[21:12] usually it located inside
[21:13] microcontroller in form of
[21:15] mass current only memory it loads the
[21:18] next
[21:19] bootloader from flash memory and checks
[21:22] its cryptographic signature using the
[21:25] key stored in
[21:27] otp read-only memory or any secure
[21:30] memory
[21:31] every next bootloader also should check
[21:34] the cryptographic signature
[21:36] of every loaded piece of code etc etc
[21:41] every vendor reinventing their own boot
[21:43] order in this case
[21:45] sometimes the boot chain is very long
[21:48] finally when operating system loads an
[21:50] application
[21:51] it also should check its signature
[21:54] this slide shows you the boot lock from
[21:57] the linux based verifone
[21:59] before the kernel started we can see
[22:02] bootloader output
[22:04] in this case it is very talkative it
[22:07] called
[22:07] sbi now we know its version
[22:11] also you can load some files from the
[22:13] usb stick
[22:15] and it loaded you boot and finally
[22:18] can allow to disclose the cpu model
[22:22] now you see the wirex operating system
[22:25] based very from
[22:26] output surprisingly it started the same
[22:29] bootloader
[22:31] again it can work with usb sticks but in
[22:34] this case
[22:34] it lowers the proprietary operating
[22:36] system kernel
[22:39] please look at the operating system
[22:41] kernel output
[22:42] here you can see the broadcom cpu model
[22:45] that was previously upgraded to internal
[22:48] verifone name
[22:50] in both cases this bootloader located at
[22:53] the start of
[22:54] non-flash
[22:57] when we dump the sbi bootloader we are
[23:00] able to disassemble
[23:01] and research it surprisingly it has a
[23:04] lot of features for factor resetting
[23:06] maintenance and building command line
[23:09] interface
[23:10] but to run this command line interface
[23:12] you should exploit the vulnerability
[23:15] related to arbitrary memory
[23:16] right that we found during our research
[23:23] another good example is ingenic italian
[23:26] ii
[23:26] based pin pads its maintenance mode
[23:29] contained a lot of features like
[23:30] boot racing firmware upload operating
[23:33] systems and
[23:34] application updates application trace in
[23:37] application debug
[23:39] and also undisclosed command line
[23:41] interface
[23:45] well how to get into these maintenance
[23:48] mods
[23:49] the answer we found in official
[23:51] documentation
[23:52] as you see to enter this mode you have
[23:55] to press
[23:56] f2 and f4 during the boot of pinpat
[24:00] and enter the password the default
[24:02] password in this case discussed many
[24:05] many times
[24:06] but no one changes it surprisingly
[24:11] you may think that another terminals
[24:13] have more secure ways to enter this mode
[24:19] this is linux based verifone model from
[24:22] mxcrs
[24:23] and surprisingly it has the same
[24:25] password with different hotkeys to enter
[24:28] the maintenance mode
[24:29] it called the system mode in this case
[24:32] at the first time when you enter to this
[24:35] mode
[24:35] it asks you to change the password and
[24:38] please look at that official screenshot
[24:41] we all see that many people change his
[24:44] password
[24:44] to the same except one last digit
[24:50] completely different approach we found
[24:52] in ingenicotellium operating
[24:54] system-based terminals
[24:56] they uses a special software called llt
[25:00] as shown on the pinpal display
[25:03] what can go wrong in this case
[25:06] the application establishes the ppp
[25:09] connection over virtual usb
[25:11] serial when it sends some bias to pinpad
[25:15] and pinpat launches the internal ftp
[25:18] server
[25:19] this ftp server used for updates and
[25:23] configuration
[25:24] the directory structure is shown in the
[25:26] llt
[25:27] software interface and the fun facts
[25:32] the ppp connection uses constant
[25:34] hardcore credentials
[25:36] custom protocol is clear text and has
[25:39] always the same bytes to open the ftp
[25:42] server
[25:43] the ftp server also uses constant
[25:46] hardcore credentials like
[25:48] ftp user ftp password
[25:51] you may do these findings without any
[25:53] reverse engineering
[25:55] just launch any usb sniffer on this usb
[25:58] bus and you surprisingly see
[26:02] that there is no encryption
[26:08] and finally you should pay attention to
[26:11] alternative work modes
[26:13] in the case of ingenico it's called
[26:15] mock-up mode and used for
[26:17] some software demonstration some
[26:19] security features are turned off in this
[26:22] mode
[26:23] for other terminals like packs you may
[26:25] find special firmwares
[26:28] that don't register timeframe and allows
[26:31] you to run
[26:31] any applications without any
[26:33] cryptographic checks
[26:35] the only one thing you will see in this
[26:38] case
[26:39] this notification when device turns on
[26:45] and now it's time to summarize all of
[26:48] our results in this research
[26:50] let's start from this well-known linux
[26:53] based
[26:54] version of mx series
[26:57] in this case we don't discuss any old
[26:59] verifone mx models
[27:01] because they are deprecated by payment
[27:04] system
[27:05] because they were very buggy
[27:09] at the first look the security measures
[27:12] are
[27:12] enough to make device unhackable
[27:16] it has all traditional tampering
[27:18] detectors and additionally maintenance
[27:20] password
[27:21] no declared access to command line
[27:24] interface
[27:25] signed updates and on the linux level
[27:29] it has well configured role based access
[27:32] control
[27:34] but the reality multiplies these
[27:36] security measures by
[27:37] zero because no one changes the default
[27:40] password
[27:42] there is special mode when sd out and
[27:44] sdr logged while
[27:46] serial port exists also you may find
[27:49] interest in a lot of shell command
[27:51] injection directly from the user
[27:53] interface
[27:54] and very simple role based access
[27:56] control bypass
[27:59] the link to this research when the
[28:01] researcher started the doom game
[28:03] is below and again we found a way to
[28:07] install and run unsigned packages
[28:11] the next interesting case is verax
[28:13] operating system based terminals
[28:16] i sure all you saw these kind of devices
[28:19] please don't be confused by a wide range
[28:21] of model like counter top portable
[28:23] devices devices with bluetooth or
[28:26] with gsm modules every vulnerability
[28:30] you found in one device will work on
[28:33] every other wireless operating system
[28:35] based device
[28:36] because they all have the same code base
[28:41] as the previous devices works best pin
[28:44] pads
[28:45] have the same measures like maintenance
[28:48] password
[28:49] command line interface doesn't exist
[28:51] updates are assigned
[28:53] and encrypted and they should have well
[28:56] tested and strong code base
[29:00] but again noun changes the maintenance
[29:02] password
[29:03] during our research we found
[29:05] pre-installed binaries from standard os
[29:08] package
[29:09] one of them called vsh like work shell
[29:14] and can be run directly from maintenance
[29:16] mode
[29:17] the result you may see on the screenshot
[29:21] we found weak cryptography schemes which
[29:24] allows you to run
[29:25] any unsigned code and finally decryption
[29:29] keys for updates decryption could be
[29:31] instructed from the device memory
[29:35] the one of the most interesting sort of
[29:37] devices is telling operating
[29:39] system-based devices by ingenico
[29:42] i also showed that at least one of these
[29:44] devices
[29:45] from the picture is known for you in
[29:48] real life
[29:50] and again there there is very wide range
[29:53] of devices
[29:54] with the same code base let's look at
[29:57] their security
[29:59] the vendor approach looks like in
[30:01] previous cases but with some
[30:03] peculiarities
[30:04] for example they used specialized
[30:07] software for maintenance and separate
[30:09] crypto processor for cryptographic
[30:11] operations
[30:13] and other things like tempered detectors
[30:15] encryption etc etc
[30:17] a standard for any point of sale
[30:20] terminals as we already know
[30:24] and what we realized during our angenica
[30:27] research
[30:28] private maintaining software is
[30:30] accessible from the internet
[30:32] a lot of protocols are accessible from
[30:34] the llt
[30:35] mode some of them are vulnerable another
[30:38] one
[30:39] allows you to run device with some debug
[30:42] capabilities
[30:45] update signature doesn't matter if you
[30:47] have remote code execution on the device
[30:49] or
[30:50] debug finally there is a lot of buggy
[30:53] legacy code
[30:58] the last one kind of pin pads is pex
[31:01] devices
[31:02] they are less known for you but the
[31:04] vendor approaches are less complex than
[31:06] any
[31:07] of previous cases
[31:12] this is why i'd recommend to start your
[31:14] research from these models
[31:16] surprisingly the maintenance software is
[31:18] accessible from
[31:20] internet again also you can find
[31:23] operating system builds with turned off
[31:25] security features for testing your own
[31:27] applications
[31:28] and to play with operating system kernel
[31:32] and probably you may do a lot of
[31:34] findings related to the legacy code base
[31:42] why you shouldn't afraid to start paying
[31:44] hardware research
[31:46] basically you don't need to have any
[31:48] banking account to interact with
[31:50] hardware
[31:51] the only thing you need at start is buy
[31:53] a couple of such pin pads
[31:55] and be ready that some of them goes to
[31:57] the thresh bin
[31:59] the approximate list of our findings is
[32:02] on the slide
[32:03] there are a lot of untested critical
[32:05] code
[32:06] we found some buffer overflows and
[32:09] logical flaws in kernel
[32:12] as well as network state and others
[32:16] almost all new abilities are exploitable
[32:18] easily
[32:20] in secure maintenance and special modes
[32:22] with default passwords
[32:26] also you may find altered and debug
[32:28] signed
[32:29] operating system builds as well as
[32:31] maintaining software and
[32:33] software development kits
[32:37] and what is the impact of such findings
[32:39] flaws and vulnerabilities
[32:42] first of all you have to understand that
[32:43] this hardware works
[32:45] with your payment card data it means
[32:48] that hardware works with your money
[32:49] directly
[32:51] the very short list of different attacks
[32:53] is on the slide
[32:55] i have to say a few words about fake
[32:57] posts
[32:58] if you were or live in europe you saw a
[33:01] lot of
[33:02] terminals in almost every touristic
[33:04] shops
[33:06] the only one reason why it happens is in
[33:08] different rules for different
[33:10] terminals with different payment systems
[33:13] when you cut swiped or inserted in fake
[33:16] not licensed
[33:17] at evil pin pad your money became not
[33:21] yours
[33:22] it happens because someone bought the
[33:24] point of sale terminal
[33:26] with no banking application but evil
[33:29] you can see on this slide advertisement
[33:32] about selling such firmware
[33:34] on some russian underground forum any
[33:37] other attacks are mostly understandable
[33:40] and you may read more about them in open
[33:42] sources
[33:43] this is another short list but in this
[33:45] case it contained vulnerabilities were
[33:48] found by
[33:48] our team as you may see
[33:51] there exists such things like hardcoded
[33:54] credentials insecure clear text and
[33:57] vulnerable protocols
[33:59] a lot of arbitrary code executions etc
[34:01] etc
[34:03] and one of my favorite is the last one a
[34:05] protein system independent code
[34:07] execution
[34:08] in verifone bootloader soon we are going
[34:11] to disclose technical details for
[34:13] every cve from this list but it would be
[34:17] a bit later
[34:21] finally i want to thank these cool guys
[34:23] for their work and help
[34:25] it was great to work together on this
[34:27] research
[34:28] the team members are timuri lucer
[34:31] dmitrius clarov
[34:33] igor zaitsev vladimir karnovich artyom
[34:36] iwatchov
[34:37] and maxim kajavnikov and that's all for
[34:40] today
[34:41] if you have any questions suggestions or
[34:43] topics to discuss
[34:44] feel free to contact me thank you for
[34:47] attention
[34:48] and stay healthy

[00:03] hello
[00:04] this is point of sale terminal security
[00:06] uncovered
[00:07] my name is alexis stanikov i am hardware
[00:09] researcher and i'm going to talk about
[00:11] payment hardware security
[00:14] when i started this research i faced to
[00:16] the lack of useful information
[00:18] related to these kind of devices
[00:21] all vendors still keep in secret their
[00:23] technologies used in such
[00:25] hardware because of many reasons
[00:27] point-of-sale terminals security
[00:30] is still a blind spot this talk is a
[00:33] combination of two years of research
[00:35] related to payment devices which handles
[00:37] your payment card data
[00:40] i am going to present general approach
[00:42] to understand the internals of hardware
[00:44] common
[00:45] weaknesses and additionally some of our
[00:47] results
[00:48] so let's start
[00:53] as you can see this presentation divided
[00:55] to two main parts
[00:57] hardware and software every topic in
[01:00] this list could be separate talk but i
[01:02] tried to highlight the most important
[01:04] things for
[01:04] each of them at the first step we have
[01:08] to understand that the post system is
[01:10] not equal to post terminal
[01:12] basically positive cell terminal or pin
[01:15] pad is a part of point of sale
[01:17] system or just a standalone device
[01:20] also point of sale system may have a
[01:22] register
[01:24] which in most cases built on windows
[01:26] based pc
[01:27] additional hardware like a barcode
[01:29] scanners
[01:30] and can be integrated to erp systems
[01:34] often when you see the title like
[01:36] someone hacked a pause it means
[01:39] hack of register or cashier workstation
[01:43] let's look at typical data flow in such
[01:45] systems
[01:46] to define entry points for intruder
[01:49] this is typical point of sale
[01:51] interaction scheme
[01:53] what can go wrong in this case as you
[01:56] can see pin pad has two kind of
[01:58] interactions
[01:59] first one is an interaction with
[02:01] terminal management system
[02:03] and payment processor through the
[02:05] internet
[02:07] second one is an interaction with point
[02:09] of sale application using local network
[02:13] communication channel between the pin
[02:15] pad and third party application or
[02:17] point of sale application can be
[02:19] configured in two different ways secure
[02:22] and insecure common attack in this case
[02:25] is the difference between amount shown
[02:27] on pin pad and amount
[02:29] really charged from your card this is
[02:32] about vulnerable configuration
[02:35] but i want to pay attention to the most
[02:37] common thing in my
[02:38] talk just keep in mind to keep
[02:41] configuration as secure as
[02:43] possible if you are maintainer of such
[02:46] systems
[02:48] i am sure that you recognized at least
[02:51] two of these terminals
[02:52] first of vendors are well known for
[02:54] united states and european countries
[02:57] and as far as i know pax is widely used
[03:00] in russia and asian countries because
[03:02] it's cheaper
[03:03] than previous two if you try to connect
[03:06] to pinpart via network connection
[03:08] you will be surprised there are no
[03:11] listening ports and
[03:12] one or two outcome connections to some
[03:15] bank servers
[03:16] in this case you have to look at other
[03:19] physical ports
[03:20] the interfaces exposed to the intruder
[03:22] are basically attack surface
[03:25] they can be divided to general
[03:27] communication interfaces like
[03:29] ethernet rs232 different wireless
[03:33] interfaces
[03:34] and specific payment card interfaces
[03:37] emv and nfc in some documentation you
[03:41] may find
[03:41] information that some of them are not
[03:44] used but in real life
[03:46] a protein system has drivers and
[03:48] handlers for some specific peripherals
[03:51] like barcode scanners and external
[03:53] receipt printers
[03:56] the next important thing is rules how
[03:58] the payment hardware
[04:00] should be built i know that regulation
[04:02] is a boring stuff but it may provide a
[04:04] lot of information about physical
[04:06] security tests and behavior
[04:08] every payment terminal should satisfy
[04:10] these requirements and regulations
[04:12] in any other cases it can be approved to
[04:16] work with payment data
[04:18] the first one is pinintro devices
[04:20] physical security requirements
[04:23] it defines protection measures against
[04:25] pin disclosure attacks like tamper
[04:27] detection
[04:28] response mechanisms and other cases
[04:31] for example if reader permits access to
[04:34] internal areas
[04:36] it is not possible using this access
[04:38] area to insert
[04:40] pin disclosing back also sensitive
[04:43] functions or information
[04:45] are only used in protected areas
[04:49] the next one is pin transaction security
[04:51] they are almost the same
[04:53] both have purpose to prevent pin
[04:55] disclosing
[04:57] these requirements also define tempo
[05:00] protection
[05:00] sensitive data arising etc etc
[05:04] and what is the sensitive data is a
[05:06] question
[05:08] every vendor chose their own
[05:10] interpretation and way to erase
[05:14] let's have a look to common security
[05:16] mechanisms and anti-tampering
[05:18] according to previous rules and payment
[05:20] system requirements
[05:22] the following events should be
[05:24] registered like a case opening security
[05:26] circuit damage
[05:27] power supply anomalies also temperature
[05:31] anomalies accelerometer anomalies
[05:35] and finally debug interfaces connection
[05:40] two or more of them should be
[05:42] interpreted as intrusion
[05:44] as a result a terminal should lock the
[05:47] event or raising
[05:48] encryption keys delete sensitive
[05:51] information
[05:52] and finally become brick this slide
[05:56] shows you a
[05:57] tamper detection list we have extracted
[06:00] from ingenicatellion2 operating system
[06:03] code
[06:04] as you may see there are a lot of power
[06:06] supply detectors
[06:08] jtag connection detector and mechanical
[06:10] temperatures like
[06:12] meshes or switches let's look at each of
[06:16] them
[06:18] when you disassemble ingenica pinpat you
[06:20] will see a lot of membrane switches
[06:23] some of them are assigned to real
[06:25] buttons like numeric and navigation
[06:27] buttons
[06:28] they are highlighted as green color but
[06:31] what are the red membranes
[06:34] there are mechanical type detectors they
[06:36] are pressed by the pin paired body when
[06:38] assembled
[06:39] when you start to rotate any screw in
[06:41] order to disassemble
[06:43] the microcontroller receives a hardware
[06:46] interrupt
[06:47] wakes up and do defined actions to
[06:49] protect its data
[06:52] another critical measure is a wire mesh
[06:55] as shown on this slide it has two main
[06:58] purposes
[06:58] anti-drilling protection and obfuscation
[07:01] case on this slide covers smart card
[07:04] reader
[07:04] and registers drilling when protection
[07:06] circuit is destroyed
[07:08] this kind of meshes you also may find on
[07:11] print circuit boards
[07:12] and ribbon cables and finally this is
[07:15] example of tempered devices
[07:18] as a result of our and finally this is
[07:22] example of tempered devices
[07:24] as a result of some of our attempts some
[07:27] of them became unusable
[07:28] and some of them asks you for a factory
[07:31] password
[07:32] the main idea is when device is tempered
[07:35] it should be passed to servers
[07:37] basically only authorized service may
[07:39] restore the device
[07:41] and only bank servers can restore it and
[07:44] load the application
[07:46] and what consequences anti-tampering
[07:48] bypass may have
[07:50] one example related to mobile point of
[07:52] sale demonstrated on black hat
[07:54] united states the researchers realized
[07:57] that this device doesn't have any
[07:59] anti-tampering detectors
[08:02] they found points on circuit to connect
[08:04] in order to obtain an encrypted
[08:06] max tribe data and finally it allows
[08:10] them to collect sensitive payment
[08:11] information directly from device
[08:14] another cool research made by sr labs
[08:17] and presented on ccc
[08:19] among their findings were anti-tampering
[08:21] bypass unlocked and exposed
[08:23] jtag connection and software
[08:25] vulnerabilities
[08:27] what you may do with such
[08:28] vulnerabilities we will discuss a bit
[08:30] later
[08:31] anywhere these finders compromised the
[08:34] world device
[08:36] and now it's deprecated another two
[08:40] examples related to the relay attacks
[08:42] and skimming
[08:43] you can read more using the links below
[08:46] and now it's time to talk about
[08:49] debugging maintenance
[08:50] features when you disassembled the point
[08:54] of sale terminal you realize that it is
[08:57] very complex device
[08:58] your imagination and background paint
[09:01] something like what you see on this
[09:02] slide
[09:04] because you know that the iphone for
[09:06] example has very specific
[09:08] jtag adapter in this case you can find
[09:11] some form topics about
[09:13] firmware uploading temporal clearing and
[09:16] related stuff
[09:18] but this is what you see in reality
[09:21] verifone unpacks use the adapter from
[09:24] simple rf-232 to ethernet connector
[09:27] with custom wiring you can reproduce
[09:30] them yourself
[09:31] ingenica use just a usual usb port for
[09:34] firmware uploading and service actions
[09:37] these cables used for factory reset
[09:40] clear security flex
[09:41] upload firmware and sometimes for
[09:43] specific debugging
[09:45] but at the moment we still don't have
[09:47] firmware and don't know
[09:49] any information about architecture of
[09:52] microcontroller
[09:53] and now we should fill this gap teardown
[09:57] is my favorite step when i work with new
[09:59] hardware
[10:00] it delivers a lot of happiness to you as
[10:02] a favorite thing to all children is to
[10:05] broke new toy and see
[10:06] what do they have inside
[10:10] in the case if you already have the
[10:12] firmware is good to understand the
[10:14] internals of hardware
[10:16] if you properly define the exact cpu or
[10:18] mcu
[10:19] it helps you to understand the operating
[10:21] system internals
[10:23] peripherals and other helpful things
[10:27] this is an example of old model made by
[10:29] verifone
[10:30] it built using samsung arm-based cpu
[10:33] you may read more about using the link
[10:36] below
[10:37] but our original friend
[10:40] this is an example of old model made by
[10:42] verifone
[10:44] it built using samsung car based cpu you
[10:47] may read more about
[10:49] using the link below but our region of
[10:52] interest
[10:52] is more modern devices this is the
[10:55] internals of
[10:57] modern verifone five to 0. here you can
[11:00] see the branded mcu and non-flash memory
[11:03] definitely this mcu should be relatively
[11:06] popular one
[11:07] but in this case it is rebranded it
[11:10] makes more difficult to understand the
[11:12] firmware internals
[11:14] in this case firmware could be dumped
[11:16] from non-flash memory using
[11:18] non-programmer
[11:19] luckily i found one guy in twitter who
[11:21] solved the same task
[11:25] he defined the exact model of mcu by
[11:27] pinout
[11:28] it was broadcom secure mcu bcm5892
[11:33] you can find header files with
[11:35] definitions of
[11:36] all peripherals in some linux kernel
[11:38] sources
[11:40] there are some other ways to determine
[11:42] the exact mcu
[11:43] and i am going to show one of them in
[11:46] next slides
[11:49] the next one is ingenico pin pad there
[11:52] is basically no difference
[11:54] is it portable or countertop they all
[11:57] build using the same hardware and uses
[11:59] the same operating system
[12:01] i sure it is well known for all of you
[12:05] you saw this photo on the slide with
[12:06] temporary detectors
[12:08] in this case pay attention to the
[12:10] microcontroller under the membrane
[12:13] it is branded cryptoprocessor they
[12:16] called it booster in their binaries
[12:18] it stores the encryption keys inside and
[12:21] handles the most of critical
[12:22] cryptography
[12:24] tasks like updates signature checks and
[12:26] etc etc
[12:30] this is other side of print circuit
[12:32] board and you see another branded
[12:35] microcontroller they call it application
[12:38] processor according to its purpose
[12:41] exactly you can find
[12:42] any information about this
[12:44] microcontroller
[12:45] as in previous case flash memory in
[12:48] upper left corner store
[12:49] separating system and application codes
[12:54] you can desolder the flash memory in
[12:57] order to obtain
[12:58] the contexts
[13:03] you can disorder the flash memory in
[13:05] order to obtain a providing system and
[13:06] application code for research
[13:09] in this case it's good to know the exact
[13:11] mcu to
[13:12] understand work with peripherals and
[13:14] other peculiarities
[13:17] one other important thing is flash
[13:19] contents you are going to dump is
[13:20] compressed
[13:22] you should solve unpacking tasks by
[13:24] yourself
[13:25] booster probably is one of atmel cortex
[13:29] and 3mcu series but in a usual package
[13:33] i can't do anything in this case without
[13:36] laboratory
[13:37] and tools for decaping application
[13:40] processor looks like general purpose
[13:42] microcontroller
[13:43] and i tried to define the exact model
[13:48] this is another scenario to define mcu
[13:51] at the first step i desoldered this mcu
[13:53] and defined the exact package
[13:55] at the next step i made list of all
[13:57] microcontroller candidates for this
[13:59] package
[14:00] then i defined power supply pins by pcb
[14:03] used multimeter
[14:05] and filtered all unfit candidates by pin
[14:08] out
[14:09] the next thing you can see in test part
[14:12] close to the microcontroller
[14:15] it may be interface used during
[14:17] production for factory flashing
[14:19] and setting up this hypothesis is
[14:22] confirmed by pull up resistor block
[14:25] the next list i made was pinout
[14:27] candidates at the moment i had
[14:29] list of microcontrollers only by
[14:32] microchip
[14:33] this list is on the slide
[14:36] and as a result i defined gtac pinout
[14:39] and i think the exact model is
[14:43] sim 9g20 we tried to apply memory and
[14:48] register maps
[14:49] to our banners and its feed
[14:52] but sadly the jtag is turned off
[14:56] the next case of pinpats is chinese
[14:59] pak's point of cell terminals
[15:01] they are very similar to verifone by
[15:04] their internals
[15:05] but it is completely different software
[15:07] inside
[15:09] when you disassemble one of them you
[15:11] will find
[15:12] the same microcontroller when you
[15:15] disassemble one of them you will find
[15:17] the same microcontroller
[15:19] and almost the same non-flash memory as
[15:22] used in
[15:22] all modern verifones none flash contains
[15:26] exposes to your encrypted and
[15:28] uncompressed binaries of proprietary
[15:31] operating system
[15:32] and application exactly the file system
[15:35] structure is proprietary
[15:38] now you can buy a couple of them from
[15:40] ebay for example and start your own
[15:43] payment hardware research
[15:46] and a few words about the tampering
[15:48] reset
[15:50] definitely all terminals have different
[15:52] ways to clear tampering flux
[15:54] some of them like packs uses simple
[15:57] hardcoded passwords
[15:58] very fun models needed to upload dummy
[16:01] encryption keys to clear temporal flags
[16:04] and in jennica as far as i know storage
[16:06] security flux and keys
[16:08] in separate hardware controller and it
[16:11] can be
[16:11] reset using an external hardware
[16:15] also some form topics contain the
[16:17] information about maintenance tampering
[16:19] clearing
[16:20] etc etc here you may see tips from
[16:24] closed russian forum about hard-coded
[16:26] passwords and special software
[16:29] the true way to understand all things
[16:32] related to tampering
[16:34] is reverse engineering
[16:37] what can you do if you can clear
[16:39] temporary flex
[16:41] for example when you cleared these flags
[16:43] you are able to upload the application
[16:45] again
[16:46] and play with the configuration
[16:49] you might write to write and upload your
[16:51] own firmwares
[16:53] typo clearing may help you to restore
[16:55] after your experiments or
[16:57] use it opened in order to research
[16:58] internal interfaces using logical
[17:01] analyzer
[17:02] some of the pin pad are able to turn on
[17:05] some debug capabilities
[17:07] and in this case you can run any
[17:10] applications
[17:10] under the debugger now when we know some
[17:14] information about the hardware and
[17:16] connections we should cover another
[17:18] blind spot
[17:19] payment card interfaces user payment
[17:23] method based upon a technical standard
[17:25] for smart payment cards
[17:27] in we originally stood for european
[17:29] mastercard and visa
[17:31] the three companies which created the
[17:34] standard
[17:35] in the most cases the hardware allows
[17:37] you to intercept
[17:38] and modify payment card data isn't cheap
[17:41] in this case we use the device called
[17:43] smart card detective with custom
[17:45] firmware
[17:46] now it's not supported by original
[17:48] developer
[17:50] but you can find the pcb and sources to
[17:52] assemble one for you
[17:54] here's a link with some information
[17:56] related to this device
[17:59] in order to understand the emv packets
[18:01] you should read a bit
[18:03] about tagland value format then you
[18:06] should go to the official site of emv
[18:09] and you will be surprised by amount of
[18:12] information what you should read
[18:14] now you see some information available
[18:16] for downloading related to emv
[18:20] every of these documents is very thick
[18:23] because it defines
[18:24] all things started from physical layer
[18:26] and deep description for every tech of
[18:28] emv
[18:31] i recommend you to read them briefly at
[18:33] least
[18:38] another interesting thing is nfc
[18:40] interface
[18:42] frame format is close to the emv but the
[18:44] physical layer
[18:45] is near field communication there are
[18:48] some approaches to start to work with
[18:50] nfc depends on your skills the most
[18:53] simple of them
[18:54] is proxmark another way is assemble your
[18:57] own sniffer or repeater based on
[19:00] some available stuff like pn532 or
[19:03] trf-based board
[19:05] also you can use android device with nfc
[19:08] or something else that fits
[19:10] to your skills our assembly was pn532
[19:14] based boards with raspberry pi
[19:16] zero it was cheap and dirty trick as you
[19:19] see
[19:19] but the components for it available
[19:22] literally
[19:23] everywhere and another batch of
[19:26] documentation
[19:27] now it is related to the nfc there are
[19:31] many deceptions
[19:32] of contactless payment transactions i
[19:34] also recommend
[19:35] read it briefly at least why is it
[19:38] important
[19:39] every payment interaction has it all on
[19:42] handler and you are able to fast
[19:46] every attack and you will be surprised
[19:49] and now it's time to discuss the
[19:51] software and firmware part
[19:53] of point-of-sale terminals
[19:58] during our research we faced two
[20:00] different operating systems
[20:02] part of them was completely proprietary
[20:05] like verifone works
[20:06] seizure intellium used by ingenico and
[20:09] paxos
[20:11] they all have legacy code base
[20:14] proprietary binary format
[20:16] etc etc another part was linux based
[20:20] devices
[20:22] android devices in this case are out of
[20:25] our scope
[20:28] the first thing we have to understand is
[20:30] device boot order
[20:32] it also have a lot of legacy because
[20:34] almost all of these operating systems
[20:37] developed before traditional secure boot
[20:40] approach became a mainstream
[20:43] after reset zero stage bootloader should
[20:45] be started
[20:46] usually it's located inside
[20:48] microcontroller in form of
[20:50] mask or only memory it loads the next
[20:54] bootloader from flash memory and checks
[20:57] it cryptographic signature using the key
[21:00] stored
[21:01] in otp read-only memory or any secure
[21:05] memory
[21:06] every next bootloader also should check
[21:09] the cryptographic signature
[21:11] of every loaded piece of code etc etc
[21:15] every vendor reinvented their own boot
[21:18] order in this case
[21:20] sometimes the boot chain is very long
[21:23] finally when operating system loads an
[21:25] application it also should check its
[21:27] signature
[21:29] this slide shows you the boot lock from
[21:31] the linux based verifone
[21:34] before the kernel started we can see
[21:37] bootloader output
[21:38] in this case it is very talkative it
[21:42] called
[21:42] sbi now we know its version
[21:46] also you can load some files from the
[21:48] usb
[21:49] stick and it loaded you boot
[21:52] and finally can allow it to disclose the
[21:55] cpu model
[21:57] now you see the vertex operating system
[22:00] based very from output
[22:02] surprisingly it started the same
[22:04] bootloader
[22:05] again it can work with usb sticks but in
[22:08] this case it lowers the proprietary
[22:10] operating system kernel
[22:13] please look at the operating system
[22:15] kernel output
[22:17] here you can see the broadcom cpu model
[22:20] that was previously erupted to internal
[22:23] verifone name
[22:25] in both cases this bootloader located at
[22:28] the start of non-flash
[22:32] when we dumped the sbi bootloader we are
[22:34] able to disassemble
[22:36] and research it surprisingly it has a
[22:39] lot of features for factor
[22:40] resetting maintenance and building
[22:43] command line interface
[22:45] but to run this command line interface
[22:47] you should exploit the vulnerability
[22:49] related to arbitrary memory
[22:51] right that we found during our research
[22:57] another good example is ingenicurtalium
[23:00] 2 based pin pads
[23:02] its maintenance mode contained a lot of
[23:04] features like
[23:05] boot racing firmware upload operating
[23:08] systems and
[23:09] application updates application trace in
[23:12] application debug
[23:14] and also undisclosed command line
[23:16] interface
[23:20] well how to get into these maintenance
[23:22] modes
[23:24] the answer we found in official
[23:26] documentation
[23:27] as you see to enter this mode you have
[23:30] to press
[23:31] f2 and f4 during the boot of pinpat
[23:35] and enter the password the default
[23:37] password
[23:38] in this case discussed many many times
[23:41] but
[23:41] no one changes it surprisingly
[23:45] you may think that another terminals
[23:48] have more secure ways to enter this
[23:50] mode
[23:54] this is linux based verifone model from
[23:56] mxcrs
[23:58] and surprisingly it has the same
[24:00] password with different hotkeys to enter
[24:02] the maintenance mode
[24:04] it called the system mode in this case
[24:07] at the first time
[24:08] when you enter to this mode it asks you
[24:11] to change the password
[24:12] and please look at that official
[24:14] screenshot
[24:16] we all see that many people change his
[24:18] password
[24:19] to the same except one last digit
[24:25] completely different approach we found
[24:27] in ingenicultarium operating
[24:29] system-based terminals
[24:31] they uses a special software called llt
[24:35] as shown on the pinpal display
[24:38] what can go wrong in this case
[24:41] the application establishes the ppp
[24:44] connection over virtual usb
[24:46] serial when it sends some bytes to pin
[24:49] pad
[24:50] and pin pad launches the internal ftp
[24:53] server
[24:54] this ftp server used for updates and
[24:57] configuration
[24:59] the directory structure is shown in the
[25:01] llt software interface
[25:05] and the fun facts the ppp connection
[25:08] uses constant hardcore
[25:09] credentials custom protocol is clear
[25:13] text
[25:13] and has always the same bytes to open
[25:16] the ftp server
[25:18] the ftp server also uses constant
[25:21] hardcore
[25:21] credentials like ftp user ftp password
[25:26] you may do these findings without any
[25:28] reverse engineering
[25:30] just launch any usb sniffer on this usb
[25:33] bus
[25:34] and you surprisingly see that there is
[25:38] no encryption
[25:43] and finally you should pay attention to
[25:46] alternative work modes
[25:48] in the case of ingenico it's called
[25:50] mock-up mode and used for
[25:52] some software demonstration some
[25:54] security features are turned off in this
[25:56] mode
[25:58] for other terminals like packs you may
[26:00] find special firmwares
[26:02] that don't register tampering and allows
[26:05] you to run any applications without any
[26:08] cryptographic checks
[26:10] the only one thing you will see in this
[26:12] case
[26:13] this notification when device turns on
[26:20] and now it's time to summarize all of
[26:23] our results in this
[26:24] research let's start from this
[26:26] well-known
[26:27] linux-based verifone of mx series
[26:32] in this case we don't discuss any old
[26:34] verifone mx models
[26:36] because they are deprecated by a payment
[26:39] system
[26:40] because they were very buggy
[26:44] at the first look the security measures
[26:47] are
[26:47] enough to make device unhackable
[26:50] it has all traditional tampering
[26:53] detectors and additionally maintenance
[26:55] password
[26:56] no declared access to command line
[26:59] interface
[27:00] signed updates and on the linux level
[27:04] it has well configured role-based access
[27:07] control
[27:09] but the reality multiplies these
[27:11] security measures by
[27:12] zero because no one changes the default
[27:15] password
[27:16] there is special mode when yesterday out
[27:19] and yesterday are logged why a serial
[27:21] port exists
[27:23] also you may find interest in a lot of
[27:25] shell command injection directly from
[27:27] the user interface
[27:29] and very simple role based access
[27:31] control by pass
[27:33] the link to this research when the
[27:36] researcher
[27:36] started the doom game is below and again
[27:40] we found a way to install and run
[27:43] unsigned packages
[27:46] the next interesting case is varex
[27:48] operating system based terminals
[27:50] i sure all of you saw these kind of
[27:53] devices
[27:54] please don't be confused by a wide range
[27:56] of modular countertop
[27:58] portable devices devices with bluetooth
[28:00] or
[28:01] with gsm modules every vulnerability you
[28:05] found
[28:06] in one device will work on every other
[28:08] wireless
[28:09] operating system based device because
[28:11] they all have the same code base
[28:16] as the previous devices works based pin
[28:18] pads
[28:20] have the same measures like maintenance
[28:23] password command line interface doesn't
[28:25] exist
[28:26] updates are assigned and encrypted
[28:29] and they should have well tested and
[28:31] strong code base
[28:34] but again noun changes the maintainance
[28:37] password
[28:38] during our research we found
[28:40] pre-installed binaries from standard os
[28:43] package
[28:44] one of them called vsh like workshell
[28:48] and can be ran directly from maintenance
[28:51] mode
[28:52] the result you may see on the screen
[28:54] shot
[28:55] we found weak cryptography skins which
[28:58] allows you to run
[29:00] any unsigned code and finally decryption
[29:03] keys for updates decryption
[29:06] could be instructed from the device
[29:08] memory
[29:09] the one of the most interesting sort of
[29:12] devices is telling operating system
[29:14] based devices by ingenico
[29:17] i also showed that at least one of these
[29:19] devices from the picture
[29:21] is known for you in real life
[29:25] and again there there is very wide range
[29:28] of devices with the same code base
[29:31] let's look at their security
[29:34] the vendor approach looks like in
[29:36] previous cases but with some
[29:37] peculiarities
[29:39] for example they use specialized
[29:41] software for maintenance and separate
[29:44] crypto processor for cryptographic
[29:46] operations
[29:47] and other things like tamper detectors
[29:50] encryption
[29:50] etc etc a standard for any point of sale
[29:54] terminals as we already know
[29:59] and what we realized during our
[30:01] engineering research
[30:03] private maintaining software is
[30:04] accessible from the internet
[30:07] a lot of protocols are accessible from
[30:09] the llt mode
[30:11] some of them are vulnerable another one
[30:14] allows
[30:14] you to run device with some debug
[30:17] capabilities
[30:19] update signature doesn't matter if you
[30:22] have remote code execution on the device
[30:24] or debug finally there is a lot of
[30:28] buggy legacy code
[30:32] the last one kind of pin pads is inspex
[30:35] devices
[30:37] they are less known for you but the
[30:39] vendor approaches are less complex than
[30:41] any of previous cases
[30:46] this is why i'd recommended to start
[30:48] your research from these models
[30:51] surprisingly the maintenance software is
[30:53] accessible from
[30:54] internet again also you can find
[30:57] operating system builds with turned off
[31:00] security features for testing your own
[31:02] applications
[31:03] and to play with operating system kernel
[31:07] and probably you may do a lot of
[31:09] findings related to the legacy code base
[31:17] why you shouldn't afraid to start paying
[31:19] hardware research
[31:21] basically you don't need to have any
[31:23] banking account to interact with
[31:25] hardware
[31:26] the only thing you need at start is buy
[31:28] a couple of such pin pads
[31:30] and be ready that some of them goes to
[31:32] the thrash bin
[31:34] the approximate list of our findings is
[31:36] on the slide
[31:38] there are a lot of untested critical
[31:40] code
[31:41] we found some buffer overflows and
[31:44] logical flaws in kernel
[31:47] as well as network state and others
[31:50] almost all new abilities are exploitable
[31:53] easily
[31:55] in secure maintenance and special modes
[31:57] with default passwords
[32:00] also you may find alternate and debug
[32:03] signed
[32:04] operating system builds as well as
[32:06] maintaining software
[32:07] and software development kits
[32:12] and what is the impact of such finance
[32:14] flaws and vulnerabilities
[32:16] first of all you have to understand that
[32:18] this hardware works
[32:19] with your payment card data it means
[32:22] that hardware works with your money
[32:24] directly
[32:26] the very short list of different attacks
[32:28] is on the slide
[32:30] i have to say a few words about fake
[32:32] posts
[32:33] if you were or live in europe you saw a
[32:36] lot of
[32:37] terminals in almost every touristic
[32:39] shops
[32:40] the only one reason why it happens is in
[32:43] different rules for different terminals
[32:45] with different payment systems when your
[32:48] card swiped or inserted in fake
[32:51] not licensed at evil pin pad
[32:54] your money became not yours it happens
[32:57] because someone
[32:58] bought the point of sale terminal with
[33:01] no banking application but
[33:03] evil humans see on dislike advertisement
[33:06] about
[33:07] selling such firmware on some russian
[33:09] underground forum
[33:11] any other attacks are mostly
[33:13] understandable and
[33:15] you may read more about them in open
[33:17] sources
[33:18] this is another short list but in this
[33:20] case it contained vulnerabilities were
[33:22] found by our team
[33:25] as you may see there exists such things
[33:28] like
[33:28] hardcore credentials in secure clear
[33:31] text and vulnerable protocols
[33:33] a lot of arbitrary code executions etc
[33:36] etc and
[33:38] one of my favorite is the last one a
[33:40] protein system independent code
[33:42] execution in verifone bootloader
[33:45] soon we are going to disclose technical
[33:47] details for every cve from this list
[33:51] but it would be a bit later
[33:55] finally i want to thank these cool guys
[33:58] for their work and help
[34:00] it was great to work together on this
[34:02] research
[34:03] the team members are timuri lucero
[34:06] dmitrius clara
[34:08] igor zaitsev vladimir karnovich arthur
[34:11] ivachov and maxim kashevnikov
[34:14] and that's all for today if you have any
[34:16] questions suggestions or topics to
[34:18] discuss
[34:19] feel free to contact me thank you for
[34:22] attention
[34:22] and stay healthy
[34:35] you
