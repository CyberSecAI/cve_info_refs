  "CVE-2018-17143": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Source": "CVE",
      "CVELink": "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-17143",
       "Description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval"
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `html` package (aka x/net/html) in Go mishandles specific HTML input, leading to a runtime panic during the parsing process. Specifically, it involves a crafted HTML string with `<template><tBody><isindex/action=0>`",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the way the `html.Parse()` function processes the specific HTML structure, causing a panic due to an invalid memory access or nil pointer dereference. The issue occurs within the `inBodyIM` function during parsing.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a denial-of-service by providing a crafted HTML input, leading to a runtime panic and termination of the program processing the input. This crash can disrupt applications or services.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the parsing of a malicious HTML string by an application using the vulnerable `html.Parse()` function.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted HTML string to be parsed by the vulnerable application. No other specific privileges or system access is needed."
    },
    "Additional Information": {
        "Fix Information": "The vulnerability is fixed in golang-googlecode-net versions `0-0.48.20190302git16b79f2.fc28` and `0-0.49.20190302git16b79f2.fc29` for Fedora 28 and Fedora 29 respectively.",
        "Upstream Fix": "The upstream fix is available in the following commit: [https://github.com/golang/net/commit/2f5d2388922f370f4355f327fcf4cfe9f5583908](https://github.com/golang/net/commit/2f5d2388922f370f4355f327fcf4cfe9f5583908)",
