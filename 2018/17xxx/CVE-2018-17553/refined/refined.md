{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a combination of two issues: an authentication bypass due to insufficient sanitization in the `database::protect` method, and a path traversal vulnerability in `navigate_upload.php` which allows uploading files to arbitrary locations.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient sanitization leading to authentication bypass",
      "Path traversal vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can achieve remote code execution on the target system.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker sends a crafted POST request to `login.php` with a modified cookie to bypass authentication, and then uploads a malicious PHP file using a path traversal vulnerability in `navigate_upload.php`.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable application; no prior authentication or special privileges are required."
