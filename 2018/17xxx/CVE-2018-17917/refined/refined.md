The provided content is related to CVE-2018-17917.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the predictable nature of Cloud IDs generated by the XMeye P2P Cloud Server. These IDs can be enumerated using MAC addresses.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Predictable From Observable State (CWE-341):** The Cloud IDs are generated in a predictable way, using the MAC address, which is an observable state, allowing attackers to enumerate potential valid IDs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker can discover and connect to valid devices using the generated Cloud IDs through the supported applications.
*  Unauthorized access to video feeds.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Remote exploitation is possible.
*   Attackers can utilize the device's MAC address to enumerate and connect to the device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to have access to the device's MAC address to generate Cloud IDs.
*   The attacker requires low skill to exploit
*   Information about this vulnerability is publicly available
