Based on the filename, it seems this content is related to a vulnerability in Dasan routers, however, without the CVE description, it's impossible to be 100% sure. I will extract the information and assume this content is related to CVE-2018-17869.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `setWan` function, which handles WAN settings. Specifically, the `ipaddr` and `gateway` parameters are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command injection: The `setWan` function uses the `system()` function with user-provided input in the `ipaddr` and `gateway` parameters without proper escaping or sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the router with root privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP requests: The vulnerability can be exploited via HTTP requests to the `/goform/setWan` endpoint.
- Authenticated: Exploitation requires authentication to the router's web interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs network access to the router's web interface.
- Attacker needs valid credentials to authenticate.
- Attacker must be able to send crafted HTTP requests.

**Additional details:**

The blog post mentions that the `setWan` function is called with the following structure:
```
system("/bin/setWan.sh ".$_POST['iface']." ".$_POST['proto']." ".$_POST['ipaddr']." ".$_POST['mask']." ".$_POST['gateway']." ".$_POST['dns1']." ".$_POST['dns2']." ".$_POST['mtu']." ".$_POST['vlanid']." ".$_POST['priority']);
```

The blog post demonstrates exploitation by inserting shell commands within the `ipaddr` parameter:
`ipaddr=1.1.1.1;telnetd -p 4444 -l /bin/sh`

This specific payload creates a telnet server on the router, which allows the attacker to gain a remote shell.
