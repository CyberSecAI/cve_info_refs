## 4. MITIGATIONS

LCDS recommends that users update to Version 4.1.0.4114, which can be found at the following location:

<http://laquisscada.com/instale1.php>

NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS-CERT website](/ics/) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

![Sistema LAquis SCADA](images/telas7.webp)

Details:

System requirements: Multi-core, RAM 8GB

Space: 120 MB

OS support: Windows

Know more:  [SCADA software](/) .

SCADA software download gets the installer. It can be installed in any folder you want.

The SCADA system installed on the computer can be used to design the screens, define input and output items ("tags"), SCADA database, generate statistical reports and optionally script source codes.

SCADA results reports can be specific if you like. Specific layouts, specific statistical calculations and optionally events in scripts.
The [SCADA software](/) can be launched by clicking on the Play button. It can be full screen or with real-time data.

To define the drivers, drag the mouse over the “tags”, in the Driver column. You can choose for example MODBUS RTU, MODBUS TCP, VAR (generic local variable), OPC, Omron, CompactLogix etc.
If you want other drivers, you can search and consult the [Knowledge Base](/blogger/). And overall, the initial step by step can be here: [Step by Step](/blogger/category/genstep/).

You can download the SCADA software and install it for testing. Any question you can ask on whatsapp or email.

In the Param1 column, in the case of [MODBUS](blogger/modbus/), just put the address in the format, for example 400000, and in the Param2 column, it is usually the equipment number.
SCADA system allows you to export shape data in various ways.
Also, SCADA can optionally be monitored in real time via the WEB.
There are several ready-made examples, depending on the application area, ready-made examples can be sent for development.
In the SCADA software, in the New menu, there are some examples.
The main one is “Generic for development”, which has variables (tags) separated by groups and login.
To define the SCADA database, just drag the mouse over the database column.
To generate the report, after running it once with the database, just create a button, direct mouse, menu “Show this button report”.
It has several report templates that can be used for [SCADA software](/) reporting.
After downloading, install as administrator if you can.
The software folder has the optional structure for developing applications.
However, you can place it in whatever position you want.
