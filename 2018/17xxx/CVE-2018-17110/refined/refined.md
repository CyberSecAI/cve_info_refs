  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `columns[0][search][value]` parameter when constructing SQL queries, leading to SQL injection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server, which could lead to data exfiltration, modification, or complete compromise of the database and potentially the application server.",

        "HTTP POST request to the `/spos/products/get_products/1` endpoint with a malicious SQL query in the `columns[0][search][value]` parameter."

    "exploit_proof_of_concept": "The provided exploit-db entry includes a complete HTTP POST request that demonstrates how to inject SQL code using a time-based blind SQL injection technique. It shows the vulnerable parameter, the injection point, and a sample payload that uses the `SLEEP()` function to confirm the vulnerability. The SQLmap result also provides information about the type of vulnerability (boolean-based blind SQL injection), the affected database system (MySQL), and the successful injection vector."
