Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-17298:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The core issue is that password reset links generated by Tuleap were not invalidated when a user changed their password. This allowed an attacker with a previously generated reset link to regain access to a user's account even after the user had changed their password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Broken Session Management:** The primary vulnerability is a flaw in session management related to password resets.  The system failed to invalidate or expire the password reset tokens after a password change.
*   **Lack of Token Invalidation:**  The system lacked the logic to properly invalidate password reset links upon password changes, leading to potential reuse of these links.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Account Takeover:** An attacker could regain access to a compromised user account, even after the legitimate user changed their password, by using the previously generated reset link.
*   **Persistence of Access:** The attacker could maintain persistent access to the user's account, bypassing the user's efforts to secure their account by changing their password.
*   **Data Breach/Manipulation:** Once in the account, the attacker could potentially access sensitive data, perform actions on behalf of the user, and/or manipulate the account.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Phishing/Compromised Credentials:** An attacker would need to initially compromise a user account or gain access to a valid email address associated with a Tuleap account.
*   **Password Reset Request:** The attacker would then request a password reset link, gaining access to a valid password reset token.
*   **User Initiates Password Change:** The user, after realizing their account might be compromised, changes their password
*   **Token Re-Use:** The attacker uses the previously generated reset link to regain control of the account.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Compromise of an Account/Email:** The attacker needs to have compromised a user account or access to the email address associated with the Tuleap account.
*   **Timing:** The attacker must request a password reset before the legitimate user changes their password.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs knowledge that the password reset tokens are not invalidated on password change.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed by invalidating reset tokens and sessions upon a password change.
*   The fix involved modifications to multiple files, particularly `src/common/dao/SessionDao.class.php`, `src/common/user/SessionManager.php`, `src/www/account/change_pw.php`,  and the addition of `src/common/user/Password/Change/PasswordChanger.php`.
* The vulnerability is referenced as CWE-640: Weak Password Recovery Mechanism.
*  The provided CVSSv3 score is 3.8 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N), indicating a low severity issue. This is likely due to the requirement of having a compromised account in the first place.
