Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-17567:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Jekyll's `EntryFilter#filter` method handled symlinks. It checked for `include?` before checking for `symlink?`. This allowed symlinks to be included in the build process, even when they should have been filtered out, by explicitly including them in the configuration.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Symlink bypass:** The primary weakness was the ability to bypass symlink filtering. By including a symlinked file or directory in the `include` configuration setting, an attacker could force Jekyll to read the target of the symlink, even if that target should have been excluded.
- **Arbitrary File Read:** This vulnerability allows for arbitrary file reads by including a symlink in the `include` configuration.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker can read any file accessible to the Jekyll process, potentially exposing sensitive information (e.g., configuration files, private keys, source code) or causing unexpected behavior.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Configuration manipulation:** The attack vector is through manipulating the `include` configuration setting in the Jekyll configuration file. An attacker would need to add a symlink to this setting.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Configuration control:** An attacker needs the ability to modify the `_config.yml` or another Jekyll configuration file. This could happen if an attacker had access to the repository or could submit a malicious pull request.

**Summary:**

The core issue is the improper order of checks in the `EntryFilter#filter` method. The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the intended symlink filtering, resulting in arbitrary file read by including a symlink in the `include` configuration and leading to potential exposure of sensitive data.
