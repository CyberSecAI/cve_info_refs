The provided content describes a stored XSS vulnerability in CuppaCMS, which aligns with the type of vulnerability that CVE-2018-17300 is likely to cover.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when creating menu items, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
