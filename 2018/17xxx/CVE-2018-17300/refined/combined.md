Affected software: CuppaCMS

Type of vulnerability: XSS (Stored)

Discovered by: BreachLock

Website: <https://www.breachlock.com>

Author: Balvinder Singh

Description: Stored attacks are those where the injected script is permanently stored on the target servers, such as in a database, in a message forum, visitor log, comment field, etc. The victim then retrieves the malicious script from the server when it requests the stored information. Stored XSS is also sometimes referred to as Persistent or Type-I XSS.

Proof of concept:

Step1: Login to the cuppa cms.

Step2:URL:<http://localhost/cuppa_cms/administrator/#/component/table_manager/view/cu_menus>

Go to the section menus and click on add item, and name them with malicious javascript.

Step3: Here the xss got executed.
