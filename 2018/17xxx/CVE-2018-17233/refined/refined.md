{
  "CVE-2018-17233": {
    "root_cause": "Incorrect protection against division by zero in the `H5D__create_chunk_file_map_hyper` function within `H5Dchunk.c`.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Division by zero"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (DoS). The program terminates due to a `SIGFPE` signal.",
    "attack_vectors": "Processing a specially crafted HDF5 file.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Ability to provide a crafted HDF5 file as input to an application using the vulnerable HDF5 library (e.g., h5dump).",
    "details": "The vulnerability occurs within the `H5D__create_chunk_file_map_hyper` function when parsing a crafted HDF5 file. A division by zero at `H5Dchunk.c:1578`, specifically `scaled[u] = start_scaled[u] = sel_start[u] / fm->layout->u.chunk.dim[u]`, is triggered when `fm->layout->u.chunk.dim[u]` is zero, leading to a `SIGFPE` signal and program termination. The provided GDB debug output shows `rdi` register, which stores the divisor, is `0x0` at the time of the division."
