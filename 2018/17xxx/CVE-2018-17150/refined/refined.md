- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The InterSystems Cach√© application is vulnerable to stored and reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to insufficient input validation and sanitization of user-supplied data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Stored XSS: In the dashboard creation functionality, the dashboard folder name is vulnerable to XSS. A client-side filter blocking periods `[.]` and slashes `[/]` can be bypassed by modifying the POST request to `Broker.cls`.
    - Reflected XSS:
        - Systemic reflected XSS was present at the `/csp/docbook/DocBook.UI.Page.cls` endpoint via the `KEY` parameter.
        - Multiple reflected XSS vulnerabilities exist in various endpoints by injecting payloads into URL parameters.
        - Reflected XSS is also present in the login page, exploitable through URL parameters (Internet Explorer specific).
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    -  **Escalation of privileges**: By injecting malicious JavaScript, attackers can perform actions on behalf of other users including administrators, allowing for the creation of new administrative accounts and extraction of sensitive data.
    - **Information Disclosure**: XSS can be used to extract the contents of the `Security.Users` database, including usernames and password hashes.
    - **Credential Theft**: The reflected XSS on the login page can be used to steal user credentials.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Stored XSS: Attackers can inject malicious code via dashboard creation functionality.
    - Reflected XSS:
        - Through crafted URLs with malicious JavaScript in the `KEY` parameter.
        - Through crafted URLs with malicious JavaScript in other vulnerable URL parameters.
        - Through crafting URLs that exploit how Internet Explorer handles URL encoding, injecting the malicious JavaScript.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - For stored XSS, attackers require low-privilege access to create dashboards.
    - For reflected XSS:
        - Authenticated attacks can be done through crafted URLs affecting any authenticated user, including administrators.
        - Unauthenticated attacks through the login page require the victim to be using Internet Explorer.
