Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way the D-Link DIR-816 router handles the `sendNum` parameter in the `/goform/Diagnosis` route. The value of this parameter is directly incorporated into a `ping` command which is then executed via `system()`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is that the router does not sanitize or validate the `sendNum` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the ping command.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands with the privileges of the web server running on the router. This could lead to a range of malicious activities including:
    - Full control over the router
    - Data exfiltration
    - Network disruption
    - Installation of malware

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST request:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP POST request to the `/goform/Diagnosis` endpoint. The request includes a modified `sendNum` parameter containing commands to be executed.
- **CSRF mitigation bypass:** Although there's a CSRF token, the provided exploit code shows how to obtain the token using a simple HTTP GET request to `/dir_login.asp` and parsing the response.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the router's web interface, either on the local network or remotely if remote administration is enabled.
- **CSRF Token Retrieval:** The attacker must be able to obtain a valid CSRF token from the router before executing the command injection.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code constructs a ping command of the form `ping -c %s ...`, where `%s` is replaced with the attacker-controlled `sendNum` parameter.
- The `system()` function is used to execute this constructed command, providing a direct path for injection.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided content gives a very precise exploitation method, which can be used to verify the vulnerability.
- The exploit requires a two-step process. The attacker must first obtain a CSRF token via a GET request before being able to use the POST request to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability, as only a valid CSRF token is required.
- The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates how to inject commands via the `sendNum` parameter with `touch /tmp/test` as an example.
