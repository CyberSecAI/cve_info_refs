Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-17101:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to out-of-bounds writes in the `cpTags` function within the `tiff2bw.c` and `pal2rgb.c` tools of the LibTIFF library. Specifically, the code does not properly check the compression type when copying certain tags which leads to a write outside the intended buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds Write:** The core issue is that the `cpTags` function in the mentioned tools attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer, potentially leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (Application Crash):** The primary impact is a crash of the application due to the out-of-bounds write.
- **Unspecified Other Impact:** There is a possibility of other unspecified impacts, but the content does not provide details.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Image File:** The attack vector is a specially crafted TIFF image file. The vulnerability is triggered when a vulnerable application processes such a malformed image.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Malicious Input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted TIFF image to a user or system that uses a vulnerable version of libtiff. This could be through a website, email, or any other method where the user might open a malicious image.
