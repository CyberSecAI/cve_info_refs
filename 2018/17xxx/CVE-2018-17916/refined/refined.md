Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-17916:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow.
- It occurs in the `UniSoft.dll` when processing a user-supplied file name.
- The vulnerable function either concatenates the filename to a fixed-size buffer or copies the filename directly if its a full path.
- The function does not properly validate the length of the user-supplied filename.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack buffer overflow due to lack of bounds checking on user-supplied filename.
- Vulnerable function is accessible through a specific message type (command 67, function 15) sent to the server listening on port 1234

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can overwrite parts of the stack and execute arbitrary code by overflowing the buffer.
- **Denial of Service:** A crash due to a stack buffer overflow can lead to denial of service.
- Complete Compromise: Successful exploitation can lead to a compromise of the InduSoft Web Studio or InTouch Edge HMI server machine due to the code being executed under the application's privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted network message to the server on the default port 1234.
- Unauthenticated Access: The exploit is possible if no main password is set in the project, or if a Guest account with a blank password is configured.
- Low privileged users can also trigger the vulnerability because the function only requires permission 1 to execute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the target system running the affected software.
- Ability to craft and send a specific network message (command 67, function 15) with a long filename to the target server on port 1234.
- No prior authentication if no master password is set, or guest account with blank password.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in `UniSoft.dll`
- The vulnerability is triggered during tag, alarm, or event related actions, such as read and write.
- The Tenable research team discovered this vulnerability while developing a Nessus plugin.
- The vulnerability is related to the processing of a filename in a command 67, function 15 message.
- The affected products are:
   - InduSoft Web Studio versions prior to 8.1 SP2
   - InTouch Edge HMI (formerly InTouch Machine Edition) versions prior to 2017 SP2
