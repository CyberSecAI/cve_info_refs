  "cve_id": "CVE-2018-17624",
  "source_texts": [
    "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of OCG objects. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process."
  ],
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of the existence of an OCG (Optional Content Group) object before operations are performed on it. This missing validation leads to a use-after-free condition.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-After-Free vulnerability due to improper object handling."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote attack via a malicious page or a malicious file."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious PDF file or host a malicious page designed to exploit the vulnerability. Requires user interaction to trigger the vulnerability either via visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file.",
