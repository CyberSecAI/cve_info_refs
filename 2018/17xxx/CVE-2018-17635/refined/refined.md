    "summary": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper object validation when handling the `desc` property in XFA documents within Foxit Reader. This can lead to a use-after-free condition allowing for remote code execution. The attack requires user interaction to open a crafted PDF or visit a malicious web page."
