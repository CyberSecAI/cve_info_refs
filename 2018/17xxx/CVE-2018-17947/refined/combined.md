The Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability can enable the attacker to
construct the URL that contains malicious JavaScript code. If the
administrator of the site makes a request to such an URL, the
attacker's code will be executed, with unrestricted access to the
WordPress site in question. The attacker can entice the administrator
to visit the URL in various ways, including sending the URL by email,
posting it as a part of the comment on the vulnerable site or another
forum.

  Vulnerable Function:  echo()
  Vulnerable Variable:  $_GET['text']
  Vulnerable URL:
<http://vulnerablesite.com/wp-admin/themes.php?page=snazzy_maps&tab=1&text=">;></script><script>alert(42)</script>
  File:                 snazzy-maps/admin/explore.php
  ---------
  28 $text = isset($_GET['text']) ? $_GET['text'] : '';
  ...
  34 <input name="text" type="text" placeholder="Search..."
value="<?php echo $text ?>"/>
  ---------

3.2 Cross-Site Scripting
  Vulnerable Function:  echo()
  Vulnerable Variable:  $_GET['tab']
  Vulnerable URL:
<http://vulnerablesite.com/wp-admin/themes.php?page=snazzy_maps&tab=1">;></script><script>alert(42)</script>
  File:                 snazzy-maps/admin/index.php
  ---------
  69 $active_tab = isset($_GET['tab']) ? $_GET['tab'] : '0';
  ...
  98 <a href="?page=snazzy_maps&tab=<?php echo $active_tab;
?>&welcome=hide" class="welcome-panel-close">Dismiss</a>
  ---------

4. Solution
===========
All users are strongly advised to update WordPress Snazzy Maps plugin
to the latest available version as soon as the vendor releases an
update that fixes the vulnerabilities.

## FAQ

### Is the plugin free to use?

The Snazzy Maps plugin is free to use for personal and open source projects. Business licenses are available for

single and multiple sites and can be purchased at https://snazzymaps.com/plugins

### How do I add a Google Map to my page?

This plugin does not add a Google Map to your page. It simply adds styles to your existing maps. If you haven’t

added a map yet, search [WordPress Plugins](https://wordpress.org/plugins) for a suitable Google Maps plugin.

### What are some compatible Google Maps plugins?

We’ve tested our plugin with the following Google Maps plugins. If you find another plugin that works please send us an email at support@snazzymaps.com.

### Snazzy Maps doesn’t work with my Google Maps plugin!

The Snazzy Maps plugin cannot apply styles to maps created using the Google Maps Embed API. This is because of

fundamental limitations on the way IFrames work on the web. We cannot access the map within Google’s IFrame and cannot

apply any styles to it. Sorry! Switching to a WordPress plugin that uses Google’s JavaScript API will work instead.

The following plugins will not work with the Snazzy Maps WordPress plugin:

* [Embed Google Map](https://wordpress.org/plugins/embed-google-map/)
* [Visual Composer](https://vc.wpbakery.com/)

If you happen to find any other map plugins that don’t work please send us an email at support@snazzymaps.com.

### How can I access my favorites or private styles from SnazzyMaps.com?

1. Sign up for an account at [SnazzyMaps.com](https://snazzymaps.com).
2. Click your email address in the top left corner.
3. Click the developer menu item on the left side.
4. Click the “Generate API Key” button.
5. Copy the long generated API Key.
6. Paste the key into the ‘Settings’ tab in the Snazzy Maps plugin.
7. You should now be able to access your favorites and private styles in the ‘Explore’ tab by changing the first filter dropdown.

Super easy to use – works right out of the box, and a ton of good looking map themes to choose from. If anything, there are too many – but you can sort by popularity etc. and search. It’s a great, simple plugin.

Thanks a lot! Great job! I was looking for an ability to apply json style to my maps, but with your plugin and your service I can even create my own in an easy way. But with thousands of existing styles I don’t need it any more.
