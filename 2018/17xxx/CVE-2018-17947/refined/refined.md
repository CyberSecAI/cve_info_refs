Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the identified vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerabilities is the improper sanitization and output encoding of user-supplied input within the WordPress Snazzy Maps plugin. Specifically, the plugin directly outputs values from the `$_GET` array into HTML attributes without proper escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin suffers from multiple reflected Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities. User-supplied input from the `$_GET` parameters `text` and `tab` are directly output into HTML attributes within the plugin's admin pages. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a logged-in administrator's browser.
- **WordPress Site Takeover:** Successful exploitation can lead to full control of the WordPress site.
- **Data Theft and Manipulation:** The attacker could potentially steal sensitive data, modify content, or perform other malicious actions.
- **Account Hijacking:** By injecting malicious scripts, an attacker could potentially hijack administrator accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious URLs:** The primary attack vector involves crafting URLs that contain malicious JavaScript code within the `text` and `tab` parameters.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers can trick administrators into clicking the malicious URL through various means, such as sending it via email or posting it on forums or comments sections.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **No special privileges are required.** An attacker simply needs to be able to craft a URL containing the malicious payload.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs a method to get a logged-in administrator to click on the malicious URL. This could be through email, comments or other forms of communication.

**Vulnerable Code Snippets:**

```php
// File: snazzy-maps/admin/explore.php
28 $text = isset($_GET['text']) ? $_GET['text'] : '';
...
34 <input name="text" type="text" placeholder="Search..."
value="<?php echo $text ?>"/>

// File: snazzy-maps/admin/index.php
69 $active_tab = isset($_GET['tab']) ? $_GET['tab'] : '0';
...
98 <a href="?page=snazzy_maps&tab=<?php echo $active_tab;
?>&welcome=hide" class="welcome-panel-close">Dismiss</a>
```
