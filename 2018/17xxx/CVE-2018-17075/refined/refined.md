  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is triggered by using tags such as `<template><object>`, `<template><applet>`, or `<template><marquee>` within a frameset context. The fix involves removing a divergence from the HTML5 specification related to the handling of `<template>` tags in frameset insertion mode."
