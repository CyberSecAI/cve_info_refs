## Description

there is no **x-content-type-options:nosniff** header when viewing raw file.

caused mime type sniffing in some browsers , finally it turns into a stored-xss vulnerability.

although there is http-only flag in cookie , attacker could still get CSRF token , and edit the **pre-receive script** to carry out remote code execution attack.

I could perform this attack in IE11/10 and other browsers using IE core.

POC

```
TESTEML
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

=3Ciframe=20src=3D=27https://try.gogs.io/mathiaswu/33323/raw/master/1221.html=27=3E=3C=2Fiframe=3E

```

save it to .eml file , and open it in IE11

[![xss-gogs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13290978/44973628-cd0a7980-af8f-11e8-97a7-c0a383435c07.jpg)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13290978/44973628-cd0a7980-af8f-11e8-97a7-c0a383435c07.jpg)

## Patch

add **x-content-type-options:nosniff** header to prevent browser from mime type sniffing , just as github / gitlab would do.
