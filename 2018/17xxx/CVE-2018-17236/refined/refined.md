The provided content is related to CVE-2018-17236.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to an invalid free operation in the `MP4Free()` function within the `mp4property.cpp` file of the libmp4v2 library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Invalid memory free: The `MP4Free()` function attempts to `free()` memory that was not allocated via `malloc` or `realloc` causing a crash due to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service: The invalid free operation leads to a crash of the application due to a SIGABRT signal (or SIGSEGV as seen in Valgrind report), effectively causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered when processing a specially crafted MP4 file using `mp4art` utility (and likely any utility that uses `MP4Modify` function and reads the MP4 file). Specifically, when adding an image via the `mp4art --add image.png --art-any $POC` command, where `$POC` is the malicious MP4 file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted MP4 file to an application using libmp4v2.
- No specific user privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability.
