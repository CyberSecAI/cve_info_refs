Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `yzmcms` application. Specifically, the `title` parameter in the `user_config_add.html` page is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to sanitize user-provided input, allowing the injection of malicious script. In this case, the `<script>alert(1);</script>` payload is injected into the `title` field and executed when the page is rendered.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that can be executed in the context of a victim's browser. This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Data theft
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Other malicious activities

**Attack vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted POST request to the `user_config_add.html` endpoint of the `yzmcms` application.
*   **Malicious Payload:** The POST request includes a malicious JavaScript payload within the `title` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   The attacker should have knowledge of the vulnerable endpoints and parameter names.
*   The attacker may need to be authenticated to access the `user_config_add.html` functionality, as it appears to be part of an admin panel

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerable endpoint is located at `/yzmcms/admin/system_manage/user_config_add.html`.
*   The vulnerable parameter is `title`.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates a successful injection of the XSS payload.
