  "CVE-2018-17644": {
    "Description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of the addItem method of a TimeField. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability arises due to the lack of validation for the existence of an object before attempting to perform operations on it, specifically within the addItem method of a TimeField.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-After-Free",
      "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Visiting a malicious page",
      "Opening a malicious file"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious page or file that triggers the vulnerability in Foxit Reader. User interaction is required (i.e., victim must visit malicious page or open malicious file)."
