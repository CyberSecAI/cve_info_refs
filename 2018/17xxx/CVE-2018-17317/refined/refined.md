The content is related to CVE-2018-17317.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to improper handling of shell metacharacters in the `io_mode` parameter within the POST request to `/scripts/config_iface.php`. This is caused by missing input validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Remote Command Execution (RCE)
- Lack of input validation

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server by sending a malicious payload within the `io_mode` parameter, potentially gaining shell access.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a POST request to `/scripts/config_iface.php`.
- The `io_mode` parameter within the POST request is used to inject shell metacharacters and commands.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests, for example using a proxy tool like Burp Suite.
