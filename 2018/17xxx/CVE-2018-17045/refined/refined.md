Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the `admin/modul/users/aksi_users.php` script within the MaeloStore application. Specifically, the script doesn't validate that requests to update user information originate from the legitimate admin user, allowing an attacker to forge requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of CSRF tokens or other mechanisms to verify the authenticity of update requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Administrator Password Change:**  An attacker can successfully change the administrator password, which leads to complete control of the MaeloStore application. This allows the attacker to:
    *   Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    *   Modify website content.
    *   Potentially perform further malicious actions within the application and its hosting environment.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Website/Link:** The attacker creates a malicious HTML page (e.g., `test.html`) that contains a form that submits a password change request to the vulnerable script when the victim visits the page.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into visiting the malicious page through social engineering, such as sending a link via email.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to host a webpage:** The attacker needs to be able to host the malicious HTML page or inject the malicious code into a trusted site the victim might access.
*   **Targeted Administrator:** The victim must be a logged-in administrator of the MaeloStore application.
*   **Knowledge of admin endpoint:** The attacker must know the target endpoint URL `http://192.168.98.95/MaeloStore-master/admin/modul/users/aksi_users.php?act=update` and the parameters necessary to change the password.

**Technical Details:**
*   The provided `test.html` demonstrates a proof of concept (PoC). It uses a hidden HTML form to send a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   The form contains fields such as `id`, `nama_lengkap`, `email`, `no_telp`, `username`, `pass_baru`, `pass_ulangi`, and `blokir`. These are used to update the administrator's account information, including the password (`pass_baru`).
