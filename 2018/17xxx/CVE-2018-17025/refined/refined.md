The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Monstra CMS version 3.0.4.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `page_meta_title` parameter when editing or creating a page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS: The injected JavaScript code is stored in the database and executed when the affected page is viewed by other users.
- Improper input sanitization: The application fails to properly sanitize the user-provided `page_meta_title` input, allowing malicious JavaScript code to be injected.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- This can lead to a variety of malicious activities such as:
  - Session hijacking
  - Stealing cookies
  - Defacing the website
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user
  - Phishing attacks
  - Potentially gaining administrative privileges through actions performed in admin interface while under attack

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker sends a crafted POST request to the `/path/admin/index.php` endpoint with the `id=pages` and `action=edit_page` parameters.
- The malicious JavaScript payload is injected into the `page_meta_title` parameter within the POST request body.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to the Monstra CMS admin panel
- The attacker requires the ability to create or edit pages.
- The attacker does not need to be privileged to a higher level than an authorized page editor.
