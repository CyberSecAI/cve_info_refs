Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-17247

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An XML External Entity (XXE) flaw exists in the `find_file_structure` API of the Machine Learning feature in Elasticsearch.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- XXE Injection: The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious XML entities, potentially leading to the retrieval of local files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: An attacker could exploit the flaw to leak the contents of local files on the Elasticsearch node. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive data the attacker should not have access to.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Specially crafted request: An attacker needs to send a crafted request to the vulnerable `find_file_structure` API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- External network access: The attacker requires the ability to make network requests to the Elasticsearch node.
- Specific Java Security Manager Configuration: The attack is only successful if a policy has been added to Elasticsearch's Java Security Manager that allows external network access, which is not the default configuration.

**Affected Versions:**
- Elasticsearch Security versions 6.5.0 and 6.5.1

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to Elasticsearch version 6.5.2.

**Additional Notes:**
- The default configuration of Elasticsearch with Java Security Manager enabled with default policies will cause the attack to fail. The vulnerability is only exploitable if the default security configuration has been modified to allow external network access.
