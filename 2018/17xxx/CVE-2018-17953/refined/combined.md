HOWTO-reproduce:  For reproducing we can use just sshd:  1) modify /etc/pam.d/sshd that it contains  account required pam_access.so debug  2) modify /etc/security/access.conf that it contains (default is empty file / just comments) some restriction set (for example for root) aka:  # tail -1 /etc/security/access.conf  -:root:ALL EXCEPT 127.0.0.0/8 ::1 172.31.255.0/24  3) test connecting with root (or any other user you've used in step #2) to sshd from non-permitted subnet .. it will pass saying, that 1.2.3.4 remote matches   APPENDIX:  see attached file, there is full output from pam_access.so in debug from 42.2 and from 15.0, so in here:  1) 42.2 where it works (I've obfuscated my client's address for security reasons):  2018-11-12T13:20:44.973771+01:00 head22 sshd[9144]: pam_access(sshd:account): login_access: user=root, from=82.113.x.y, file=/etc/security/access.conf 2018-11-12T13:20:44.974104+01:00 head22 sshd[9144]: pam_access(sshd:account): line 124: - : root : ALL EXCEPT 127.0.0.0/8 ::1 192.168.60.0/24 172.31.255.0/24 ... 2018-11-12T13:20:44.976942+01:00 head22 sshd[9144]: pam_access(sshd:account): from_match=1, "82.113.x.y" 2018-11-12T13:20:44.977006+01:00 head22 sshd[9144]: pam_access(sshd:account): access denied for user `root' from `82.113.x.y' 2018-11-12T13:20:44.977089+01:00 head22 sshd[9144]: fatal: Access denied for user root by PAM account configuration [preauth]   ++ fyi also from sshd POV (using sshd -Dd):  Nov 12 12:59:33 head22 sshd[8277]: debug1: userauth-request for user root service ssh-connection method none [preauth] Nov 12 12:59:33 head22 sshd[8277]: debug1: attempt 0 failures 0 [preauth] Nov 12 12:59:33 head22 sshd[8277]: debug1: PAM: initializing for "root" Nov 12 12:59:33 head22 sshd[8277]: debug1: PAM: setting PAM_RHOST to "82.113.x.y" Nov 12 12:59:33 head22 sshd[8277]: debug1: PAM: setting PAM_TTY to "ssh" ...

My access.conf looks like this:  -:root:ALL EXCEPT 127.0.0.0/8 ::1  According to the documentation access should be denied to root from everywhere, but local network interfaces. However, I can still connect via 192.168.122.0/24.   There have been some subtle changes to the logic of this module [1]. Most probably some change has introduced this regression.

Yepp ... that seems to be the case.
