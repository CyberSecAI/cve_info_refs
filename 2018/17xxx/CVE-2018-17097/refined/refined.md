The provided content describes multiple assertion failures and memory corruption issues in the SoundTouch audio processing library, specifically version 2.0, when using the `soundstretch` command-line tool. These issues are triggered by specific command-line arguments and input files.

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Assertion Failure in `detectBPM` Function:**
    *   **Root cause:** The `detectBPM` function asserts that `BUFF_SIZE % nChannels == 0`. This condition is not met in certain scenarios, leading to program termination.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper handling of buffer size and number of channels.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service due to program termination.
    *   **Attack vector:** Providing specific command-line arguments that trigger the assertion failure.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to execute the `soundstretch` tool with specific input files and command-line arguments.

2.  **Assertion Failure in `BPMDetect` Constructor:**
    *   **Root cause:** The `BPMDetect` constructor asserts that `INPUT_BLOCK_SIZE < decimateBy * DECIMATED_BLOCK_SIZE`. This condition fails under specific conditions leading to program termination.
    *   **Weakness:**  Improper configuration of block sizes during BPM detection.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service due to program termination.
    *   **Attack vector:** Providing specific command-line arguments that trigger the assertion failure.
    *    **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to execute the `soundstretch` tool with specific input files and command-line arguments.

3.  **Heap Corruption (Corrupted Size vs. Prev_size):**
    *   **Root cause:** Memory corruption occurs during processing, leading to a "corrupted size vs. prev_size" error.
    *   **Weakness:** Memory management error.
    *   **Impact:** Program crash, potential for arbitrary code execution if exploited further.
    *   **Attack vector:** Input file `POC-3` along with the `-bpm=60` command-line argument.
    *    **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to execute the `soundstretch` tool with specific input files and command-line arguments.

4.  **Double Free or Corruption:**
    *   **Root cause:** A double free error occurs.
    *   **Weakness:** Memory management error.
    *   **Impact:** Program crash, potential for arbitrary code execution if exploited further.
    *   **Attack vector:** Input file `POC-4` along with the `-tempo=-50` command-line argument.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to execute the `soundstretch` tool with specific input files and command-line arguments.

**Additional Information:**
*   The issues are triggered using the `soundstretch` command-line utility, part of the SoundTouch library.
*   The provided information includes the specific command-line options and example files to trigger the errors, making it easier to reproduce.
*   The provided information gives more detail than a typical CVE description, including specific code locations and stack traces for the issues.

**CVE Relevance:**
This content is relevant to CVE-2018-17097 as the issues described are exploitable and demonstrate vulnerabilities within the SoundTouch library. The content provides details that could be used for creating exploits against vulnerable software, including denial of service and potential for more severe impact if memory corruption issues are exploited further.
