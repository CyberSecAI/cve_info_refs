The provided content contains information related to CVE-2018-17043.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow in the `Storage::init` function of the `doc2txt` program.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap buffer overflow in `Storage::init` when processing a crafted .doc file.
- Heap buffer overflow in `read_stream` which is called by `Storage::init`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Program crash due to memory corruption.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution if the overflow is carefully crafted.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted .doc file as input to the `doc2txt` program.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply the malicious .doc file to the `doc2txt` program. This can be done by having the user process the file or through another means if `doc2txt` is part of a larger attack surface.

**Technical Details:**
- The overflow in `Storage::init` occurs when the `memset` function writes beyond the allocated buffer, as indicated by the AddressSanitizer (ASAN) output. Specifically, 8760 bytes are written to a 4380-byte region.
- The overflow in `read_stream` happens when trying to read 4 bytes from a 1 byte region.
- The ASAN output shows the exact location of the memory corruption and the call stack leading to the vulnerability.
- The provided ASAN output highlights the specific lines of code where the errors occur, allowing for debugging.
- The vulnerability is reproducible using specific .doc files.
