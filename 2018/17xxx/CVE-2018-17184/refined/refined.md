The provided content contains information about CVE-2018-17184.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in Apache Syncope's Admin Console. Malicious users with administrative privileges could inject HTML-like elements containing JavaScript code into several fields such as Connector names, Report names, AnyTypeClass keys, and Policy descriptions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- When another user with administrative privileges edits any of the affected entities through the Admin Console, the injected JavaScript code is executed. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves a malicious user with administrative rights injecting malicious JavaScript code through the administrative interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrative privileges sufficient to modify entities like Connector names, Report names, AnyTypeClass keys and Policy descriptions. They must be able to access and modify these configuration elements through the Admin Console.
