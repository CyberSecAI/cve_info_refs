The provided content contains information about CVE-2018-17537.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The blog-viewer, when displaying a notice for the presence of a `package.json` file, lacked input validation and output encoding.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts that would execute in the context of other users' browsers when they view a repository containing a malicious `package.json` file, potentially leading to session hijacking or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:** By including a specially crafted `package.json` file in a GitLab repository, the attacker can exploit the vulnerability, targeting users viewing the repository.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a repository to include the malicious `package.json` file. No user interaction is required beyond viewing the repository.

**Affected versions:** GitLab CE/EE 10.4 and later.
