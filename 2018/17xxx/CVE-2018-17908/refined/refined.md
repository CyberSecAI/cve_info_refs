- **Root cause of vulnerability**: During installation, the application installer disables user access control and does not re-enable it after the installation is complete.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Access Control (CWE-284). The application disables user access control during installation and fails to re-enable it afterward.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could run elevated arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors**: Local. Exploitation requires local access but does not require any privileges or user interaction.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have local access to the system where the vulnerable software is installed. No special privileges are required.
