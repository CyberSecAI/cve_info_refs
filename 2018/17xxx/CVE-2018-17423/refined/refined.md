Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2018-17423:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The content directly relates to a reported vulnerability in e107, specifically mentioned in the repository `Kiss-sh0t/e107_v2.1.9_XSS_poc` and the issue `e107inc/e107/issues/3414`, which indicates a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Although the specific vulnerability details are removed ("(removed)") in the issue description, the context indicates it pertains to an XSS issue. This aligns with the general nature of XSS vulnerabilities. Therefore it is likely related.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    *   The content indicates the presence of a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in e107 version 2.1.9. However, the exact vulnerable location or code is redacted ("(removed)").

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   The vulnerability is an XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) flaw. XSS vulnerabilities occur when user-supplied data is not properly sanitized or encoded before being displayed in a web page. This can allow malicious scripts to be injected into the page.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   The impact is not directly stated. Typically, XSS vulnerabilities can lead to:
        *   Session hijacking
        *   Malware injection
        *   Defacement of the website
        *   Redirection to malicious sites
        *   Stealing sensitive user information (cookies, tokens, etc.)
        *   Executing arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through the input of user-supplied data. The exact entry point is not specified. It could potentially be through a form, URL parameter, or any other user input that is reflected on a webpage without proper sanitization.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the web application through some input. The attacker would need to identify the vulnerable entry point and inject the payload.
    *   The user would then have to visit the vulnerable page for the script to execute.

**Additional Notes**
*   The provided content does not contain specifics of the vulnerable code or input parameters.
*   The GitHub issue is closed, suggesting that the vulnerability was likely addressed in a later version of e107.
*   The repository `Kiss-sh0t/e107_v2.1.9_XSS_poc` seems to serve as a proof-of-concept (POC) for the identified XSS vulnerability.

In summary, the provided content reveals the presence of an XSS vulnerability in e107 version 2.1.9, although the specific technical details about the vulnerable code or input are not included due to redaction.
