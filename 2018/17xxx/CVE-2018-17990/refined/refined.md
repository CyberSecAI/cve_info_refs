{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The D-Link DSL-3782 router's web interface does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when creating Access Control Lists (ACLs), leading to OS command injection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation of user-provided data within the web interface.",
      "Direct use of user-controlled data as parameters in OS commands."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands on the router, potentially gaining full control over the device, including data exfiltration or modifying device settings.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the router's web interface. This request includes shell metacharacters in the parameters used to create a new ACL rule.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be authenticated to the router's web interface. However, the article mentions that a previously discovered authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2018-8898) can be chained with this exploit, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to potentially execute the OS command injection."
  },
    "cve_id": "CVE-2018-17990"
