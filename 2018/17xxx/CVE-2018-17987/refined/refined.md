Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-17987:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the use of a predictable value, specifically `block.blockhash(block.number - 1)`, as a source of randomness in the `determineWinner` function of the HashHeroes smart contract. This allows the last player to claim a tile to influence the outcome of the game.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Predictable Randomness:** The use of `block.blockhash` for generating random numbers is a well-known vulnerability in smart contracts because the block hash of the previous block is known to miners and can be influenced.
    *   **Lack of Secure Random Number Generation:** The smart contract lacks a proper method for generating secure random numbers.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker, by being the last person to claim a tile, can control the `winningHash`, and thus the `winningX` and `winningY` coordinates. This allows the attacker to manipulate the outcome of the game and ensure they win the prize, which is essentially all the ether paid for the tiles.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the `claimTile` function, specifically by strategically being the last to call it to trigger the vulnerable `determineWinner` function.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the smart contract, and have the ability to call the `claimTile` function.
    *   The attacker needs to be aware of the game's mechanics, and the value of `NUM_TILES`.
    *   The attacker needs to be the last person to purchase a tile to trigger `determineWinner()` when `numTilesClaimed == NUM_TILES`.
    *   The attacker needs to monitor the smart contract or game state to know when they should be the last buyer.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided exploit code demonstrates how an attacker could exploit this vulnerability, by calculating the winning coordinates based on blockhash and only purchasing a tile if it results in them being the winner.

*   The content mentions that secure random number generation is difficult in solidity, and points to other "Bad Randomness" CVEs.

*   The `determineWinner` function uses a byte from `winningHash` to calculate the winning x and y coordinates, which are then used to determine the winner.

* The `attack` function in the exploit code checks if the `numTilesClaimed` is equal to 255, because the winner is picked right after that.

In summary, this CVE highlights the dangers of using predictable on-chain data for randomness generation in smart contracts, showcasing how it can be exploited to allow an attacker to manipulate game outcomes for their benefit.
