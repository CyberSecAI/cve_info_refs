Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-17931:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Improper access control.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The vulnerability stems from the ability to alter scripts on the VGo Robot if an attacker has physical access to the device. This ability allows for code execution with root privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker with physical access can gain root privileges by altering scripts on the robot, potentially leading to complete system compromise. This would give the attacker the ability to take full control over the robot.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is physical access to the VGo Robot.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker must have physical access to the VGo Robot. They do not need any special privileges or credentials prior to physical access.
