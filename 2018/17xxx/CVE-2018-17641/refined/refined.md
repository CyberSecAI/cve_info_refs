      "content": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of the deleteItem method of a TimeField. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",

  "summary": "The provided documents describe multiple vulnerabilities, all related to use-after-free or other memory corruption issues, that can allow for remote code execution in various Foxit products. The root causes involve incorrect handling of memory, pointers, and object lifetime, especially within JavaScript and XFA handling. Attackers could exploit these by crafting specific PDF files or through specially designed websites."
