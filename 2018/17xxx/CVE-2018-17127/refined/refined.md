- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `httpd` service on the ASUS GT-AC5300 router calls `atol()` on the parameter `timestap` in the `/blocking_request.cgi` handler without checking if it's a NULL pointer. If the `timestap` parameter is missing, `atol()` is called on a NULL pointer which causes a crash.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in the `httpd` service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The `httpd` service crashes, resulting in a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a POST request to `/blocking_request.cgi` without the `timestap` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface. The `Referer` header must match the router's address to bypass CSRF protection.
