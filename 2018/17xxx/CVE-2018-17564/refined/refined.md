Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-17564:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a combination of factors in the `/app/war/cgi-bin/delete_CA` script:

*   **Insecure Input Handling:** The `haserl` CGI wrapper does not properly sanitize URL-encoded input strings containing spaces, specifically when used in combination with the `-o` operator. This allows an attacker to inject malicious values into the `_id` variable.
*   **Unvalidated Input in Test Condition:** The `test -e $file_path` condition uses the attacker controlled `_id` variable. Due to the usage of `-o` operator, it is always evaluated as true, bypassing file existence checks.
*   **Mathematical Operation Vulnerability:** The expression `pvalue=echo $((_id + 8433))` does not sanitize the input, allowing an attacker to manipulate the value of `pvalue`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The ability to inject a crafted string into the `_id` variable and bypass the file check leads to the execution of arbitrary commands in the `nvram unset $pvalue` statement.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** This vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users, as it does not require prior login to the device.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Admin Password Reset:** By manipulating the `pvalue` to point to the variable containing the admin password (numerical variable "2"), an attacker can delete it using the `nvram unset` command.
*   **Configuration Manipulation:** The vulnerability can be exploited to delete any numeric variable in the deviceâ€™s configuration by manipulating the value of `pvalue`

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP GET request sent to the `/app/war/cgi-bin/delete_CA` script on the device's web server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Grandstream GXP1625 VoIP phone or have access to it through network routing.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker must know the URL of the vulnerable CGI script (`/app/war/cgi-bin/delete_CA`).
*   **Understanding of URL Encoding:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft URL-encoded strings containing spaces to bypass the `haserl` sanitization.

In summary, CVE-2018-17564 allows an attacker to reset the admin password on the Grandstream GXP1625 VoIP phone through a crafted HTTP request, taking advantage of insecure input handling and command injection vulnerabilities. This effectively allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the device.
