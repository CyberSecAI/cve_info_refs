The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in WUZHI CMS v4.1.0, specifically within the `/coreframe/app/coupon/admin/card.php` file.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the insecure handling of the `groupname` parameter within the `detail_listing` function. The `groupname` parameter is taken directly from the `$_GET` array via `$GLOBALS` without sufficient sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The `groupname` parameter is used to construct a SQL WHERE clause without proper escaping or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code. The code uses `strip_tags` but this function only removes HTML and PHP tags, not SQL-relevant characters.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to:
    - Data exfiltration or modification
    - Privilege escalation
    - Denial of service
    - Complete compromise of the application and potentially the server

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted GET request to the `/index.php` endpoint with specific parameters. The vulnerable parameter is `groupname`.
- **Specific URL:** `/index.php?m=coupon&f=card&v=detail_listing&groupname=[malicious_sql]&_su=wuzhicms`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote attacker:** The attacker can be remote and does not need prior access to the system.
- **Network access:** The attacker requires network access to the target server.
- **Knowledge of vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URL and parameters.

**Additional details:**
- The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates how to use the `updatexml` function to extract information from the database using a crafted `groupname` parameter.
- The vulnerable code snippet is located on line 39 of `/coreframe/app/coupon/admin/card.php`.
- The application uses the `get_list` method which uses the unsanitized input.
