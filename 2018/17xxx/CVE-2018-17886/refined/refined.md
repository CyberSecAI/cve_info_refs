Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an inadequate XSS filter implementation in Jeesns 1.3. The filter uses a blacklist approach, which can be easily bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insufficient Blacklist:** The filter only replaces a few specific tags (`<style>`, `<script>`) and event handlers. It doesn't block other potentially harmful tags like `svg` or `img`, nor does it account for variations in event handler syntax.
*  **Blacklist Approach:** Blacklisting is inherently flawed, as it's difficult to anticipate all possible attack vectors.
*   **Bypassable Event Handling:** The filter attempts to neutralize event handlers by adding an underscore prefix, but this is trivially circumvented with alternative event handler syntaxes such as onLoad in `<svg>`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application that will be executed in the browsers of other users who access the affected content. This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking (stealing cookies).
    *   Data theft.
    *   Defacement of the website.
    *   Redirection to malicious sites.
    *   Other malicious actions that the user is authorized to perform.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Payload Injection:** The attacker injects a malicious payload such as `<svg/onLoad=confirm(document.cookie)>`  into a text field, specifically when posting a new article.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a registered and logged-in user of the Jeesns application to create an article.
*   **Knowledge of Bypass:** The attacker needs knowledge of how to bypass the existing blacklist filter (e.g., by using svg tags, and different spelling for event handlers).

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerability is demonstrated through a specific example using the `<svg/onload=confirm(document.cookie)>` payload.
* The vulnerability was introduced as a bypass to a fix for CVE-2018-12429 which attempted to address XSS via a blacklist.
* This XSS vulnerability is triggered when an administrator or other user visits the article list where the injected payload exists, not just the author of the malicious post.
