The provided content relates to CVE-2018-17106.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `do_mkd` function within the `ftpproto.c` file of the Tinyftp project. The vulnerability arises from insufficient bounds checking when creating a new directory with a path that is longer than expected.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The `text` buffer, declared as `char text[200]`, is overflowed in the `sprintf` function when the combined length of the current working directory (`dir`) and the user-supplied argument (`sess->arg`) exceeds 200 bytes.
- **Lack of bounds checking:** The code doesn't validate the length of the combined string before using `sprintf` to write into the `text` buffer

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Overwrite EBP:** As stated in the issue, overwriting EBP occurs, leading to potential control-flow hijacking.
- **Remote Code Execution:** It is implied that this buffer overflow could lead to Remote Code Execution by overwriting the return address or other critical parts of the stack.

**Attack vectors:**
- **FTP MKD command:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user sends an FTP `MKD` command with a path that results in an overly long string when combined with the current working directory.
- **Remote network:** This vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the server running the vulnerable Tinyftp instance.
- **Ability to send MKD commands:** The attacker must be able to issue FTP commands, specifically the MKD command with an overly long argument.
