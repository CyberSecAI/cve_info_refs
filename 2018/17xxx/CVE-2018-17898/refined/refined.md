Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-17898:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by the controller application failing to prevent memory exhaustion due to unauthorized requests to the HTTP service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion') (CWE-400):** The lack of proper input validation and request handling allows an attacker to send requests that consume excessive memory, leading to resource exhaustion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation can cause the controller to become unstable. This suggests the potential for service disruption or denial of service by exhausting the controller's resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network (N):** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network. Attackers do not need physical access to the controller or to be present on the local network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Complexity:** The attack is of low complexity. This implies the exploit is relatively straightforward and does not require special skills or techniques.
*   **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need prior access to the system or any administrative rights.
*   **No User Interaction:** No user action is required for the attack to be successful, implying it can be automated or launched without any user awareness.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**
*   **Affected Products:**
    *   FCJ (R4.10 and prior)
    *   FCN-100 (R4.10 and prior)
    *   FCN-RTU (R4.10 and prior)
    *   FCN-500 (R4.10 and prior)
*  **CVSS v3 Base Score:** 5.3
*   **CVSS Vector String:** AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L

This information aligns with the CVE description, detailing how a remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service condition by sending excessive requests that exhaust the system's resources.
