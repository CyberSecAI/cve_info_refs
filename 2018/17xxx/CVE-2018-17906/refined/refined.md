- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from weak password requirements and the use of default credentials within third-party software, as well as a lack of authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Weak password requirements (CWE-521), default credentials, and missing authentication mechanisms.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with local network access can compromise the system, potentially impacting confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system component.
- **Attack vectors**: Local network access is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have access to the local network where the affected systems are deployed. The exploit requires a low skill level.
