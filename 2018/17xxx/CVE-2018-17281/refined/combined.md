               Asterisk Project Security Advisory - AST-2018-009

         Product        Asterisk
         Summary        Remote crash vulnerability in HTTP websocket upgrade
    Nature of Advisory  Denial Of Service
      Susceptibility    Remote Unauthenticated Sessions
         Severity       Moderate
      Exploits Known    No
       Reported On      August 16, 2018
       Reported By      Sean Bright
        Posted On

     Advisory Contact   Rmudgett AT digium DOT com
         CVE Name       CVE-2018-17281

    Description  There is a stack overflow vulnerability in the
                 res_http_websocket.so module of Asterisk that allows an
                 attacker to crash Asterisk via a specially crafted HTTP
                 request to upgrade the connection to a websocket. The
                 attackerâs request causes Asterisk to run out of stack
                 space and crash.

    Resolution  Disable HTTP websocket access by not loading the
                res_http_websocket.so module or upgrade Asterisk to a fixed
                version.

| Description: | The HTTP request processing in res\_http\_websocket allocates additional space on the stack for various headers received during an Upgrade request. An attacker could send a specially crafted request that causes this code to overflow the stack, resulting in a crash.   NOTE: A bug in ast\_iostream\_gets() currently gives 15+ versions some slight protection from [^req.txt] causing a crash because the extra long header values are too long.  The extra long lines cause the request to be rejected as a result.  However, if they were 2K long with more of them to compensate we would still get the crash from blowing the stack. | | |
| Comments: | By: Asterisk Team (asteriskteam) 2018-08-16 11:07:02.869-0500This issue has been automatically restricted and set to a blocker due to being a security type issue. If this is not a security vulnerability issue it will be moved to the appropriate issue type when triaged.  ---   By: Asterisk Team (asteriskteam) 2018-08-16 11:07:03.513-0500Thanks for creating a report! The issue has entered the triage process. That means the issue will wait in this status until a Bug Marshal has an opportunity to review the issue. Once the issue has been reviewed you will receive comments regarding the next steps towards resolution.   A good first step is for you to review the [Asterisk Issue Guidelines|https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/Asterisk+Issue+Guidelines] if you haven't already. The guidelines detail what is expected from an Asterisk issue report.   Then, if you are submitting a patch, please review the [Patch Contribution Process|https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/Patch+Contribution+Process].  ---   By: Sean Bright (seanbright) 2018-08-16 11:09:11.415-0500Sample request that causes the crash  ---   By: Friendly Automation (friendly-automation) 2018-09-20 12:31:04.528-0500Change 10216 merged by Richard Mudgett:  AST-2018-009: Fix crash processing websocket HTTP Upgrade requests   [https://gerrit.asterisk.org/10216|https://gerrit.asterisk.org/10216]  ---   By: Friendly Automation (friendly-automation) 2018-09-20 12:31:11.074-0500Change 10217 merged by Richard Mudgett:  AST-2018-009: Fix crash processing websocket HTTP Upgrade requests   [https://gerrit.asterisk.org/10217|https://gerrit.asterisk.org/10217]  ---   By: Friendly Automation (friendly-automation) 2018-09-20 12:31:16.303-0500Change 10218 merged by Richard Mudgett:  AST-2018-009: Fix crash processing websocket HTTP Upgrade requests   [https://gerrit.asterisk.org/10218|https://gerrit.asterisk.org/10218]  ---   By: Friendly Automation (friendly-automation) 2018-09-20 12:31:23.314-0500Change 10219 merged by Richard Mudgett:  AST-2018-009: Fix crash processing websocket HTTP Upgrade requests   [https://gerrit.asterisk.org/10219|https://gerrit.asterisk.org/10219]  ---   By: Friendly Automation (friendly-automation) 2018-09-20 12:31:26.766-0500Change 10220 merged by Richard Mudgett:  AST-2018-009: Fix crash processing websocket HTTP Upgrade requests   [https://gerrit.asterisk.org/10220|https://gerrit.asterisk.org/10220]  ---   By: Friendly Automation (friendly-automation) 2018-09-20 12:31:31.672-0500Change 10222 merged by Richard Mudgett:  AST-2018-009: Fix crash processing websocket HTTP Upgrade requests   [https://gerrit.asterisk.org/10222|https://gerrit.asterisk.org/10222]  ---   By: Friendly Automation (friendly-automation) 2018-09-20 12:31:37.700-0500Change 10221 merged by Richard Mudgett:  AST-2018-009: Fix crash processing websocket HTTP Upgrade requests   [https://gerrit.asterisk.org/10221|https://gerrit.asterisk.org/10221]  ---   By: Friendly Automation (friendly-automation) 2018-09-20 12:31:43.596-0500Change 10223 merged by Richard Mudgett:  AST-2018-009: Fix crash processing websocket HTTP Upgrade requests   [https://gerrit.asterisk.org/10223|https://gerrit.asterisk.org/10223]  ---   By: Friendly Automation (friendly-automation) 2018-09-20 12:31:48.433-0500Change 10224 merged by Richard Mudgett:  AST-2018-009: Fix crash processing websocket HTTP Upgrade requests   [https://gerrit.asterisk.org/10224|https://gerrit.asterisk.org/10224]  ---   By: Friendly Automation (friendly-automation) 2018-09-20 12:31:52.988-0500Change 10225 merged by Richard Mudgett:  AST-2018-009: Fix crash processing websocket HTTP Upgrade requests   [https://gerrit.asterisk.org/10225|https://gerrit.asterisk.org/10225]  --- | | |

         CVE Name       CVE-2018-17281

    Description  There is a stack overflow vulnerability in the
                 res_http_websocket.so module of Asterisk that allows an
                 attacker to crash Asterisk via a specially crafted HTTP
                 request to upgrade the connection to a websocket. The
                 attackerâs request causes Asterisk to run out of stack
                 space and crash.

    Resolution  Disable HTTP websocket access by not loading the
                res_http_websocket.so module or upgrade Asterisk to a fixed
                version.

Package        : asterisk
Version        : 1:11.13.1~dfsg-2+deb8u6
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-17281
Debian Bug     : 909554

Sean Bright discovered that Asterisk, a PBX and telephony toolkit,
contained a stack overflow vulnerability in the res_http_websocket.so
module that allowed remote attackers to crash Asterisk via specially
crafted HTTP requests to upgrade the connection to a websocket.

We recommend that you upgrade your asterisk packages.
