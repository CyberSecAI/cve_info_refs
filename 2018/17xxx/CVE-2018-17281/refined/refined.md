Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-17281:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a stack overflow in the `res_http_websocket.so` module of Asterisk.
*   The module allocates additional space on the stack for HTTP headers received during a WebSocket Upgrade request.
*   A specially crafted HTTP request with excessive headers causes the code to overflow the stack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a classic stack overflow due to unbounded allocation of stack memory for processing HTTP headers.
*   **Unbounded Resource Consumption:** The code does not properly limit the number or size of HTTP headers read from the incoming request before allocating stack space.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The stack overflow leads to a crash of the Asterisk server process, resulting in a denial of service.
*   **Remote Crash:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can trigger this crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed by sending a specially crafted HTTP request over the network to a vulnerable Asterisk server.
*   **HTTP WebSocket Upgrade Request:** The specific attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP request intended to upgrade the connection to a WebSocket.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable Asterisk server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring prior authentication to the Asterisk server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by an attacker sending a large number of HTTP header fields in a WebSocket upgrade request.
*   Prior to a fix, a bug in `ast_iostream_gets()` provided some slight protection by rejecting excessively long header lines, but the vulnerability could still be triggered by sending a sufficient number of headers with lengths around 2KB.

**Affected Versions:**

*   Asterisk Open Source: 13.x, 14.x, 15.x (all releases)
*   Certified Asterisk: 13.21 (all releases)

**Fixed Versions:**

*   Asterisk Open Source: 13.23.1, 14.7.8, 15.6.1
*   Certified Asterisk: 13.21-cert3
