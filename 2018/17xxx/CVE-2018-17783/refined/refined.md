Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-17783:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of the project name when it's displayed on the `manage_filter_edit_page.php` page. Specifically, the `project_get_name()` function returns the project name without encoding it for HTML output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS.  The unsanitized project name, which could contain malicious JavaScript, is directly outputted into the HTML, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Stealing sensitive information (e.g., cookies, credentials)
    *   Modifying page content
    *   Redirecting the user to malicious websites

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** The attack is reflected, meaning the malicious payload is embedded in the URL or other request parameters, sent to the vulnerable page, and then reflected back to the user within the HTML output.
*   **Manipulation of Project Name:** The attacker needs to manipulate a project name to include malicious Javascript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince a user to click on a malicious link, or visit the vulnerable page with a crafted project name.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Page:** The attacker needs to know about the vulnerable page (`manage_filter_edit_page.php`) and how it handles project names.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix involves using `string_display_line()` function to properly sanitize the project name before displaying it on the page.
*   The vulnerability is present in MantisBT versions prior to 2.17.2.
*   The MantisBT team addressed this issue along with CVE-2018-17782. They also noted that both vulnerabilities could have been grouped under a single CVE.
*   The commit fixing this vulnerability can be found at: `https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/commit/b9453cd7643b7c5b1b8c716b1dbd4d7d9571d1ec`
