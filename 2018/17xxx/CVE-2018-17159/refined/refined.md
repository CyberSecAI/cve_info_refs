The provided content relates to CVE-2018-17159.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient and improper checking in the NFS server code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The NFS server code has inadequate checks, potentially leading to exploitable conditions.

**Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker could cause the NFS server to crash, resulting in a denial of service (DoS), or potentially achieve remote code execution (RCE) on the server.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through a specially crafted network packet sent to the NFS server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable NFS server. The advisory suggests that a firewall should be used to protect the NFS service port from arbitrary, untrusted clients.
