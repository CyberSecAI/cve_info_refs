{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Teamwire desktop client uses AngularJS which is vulnerable to template injection when user-controlled data is embedded insecurely into templates. The application does not properly sanitize or encode the group chat name, which allows the execution of arbitrary Javascript code within the application when the chat is rendered.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Template Injection",
      "Insecure embedding of user-controlled data",
	  "Lack of input sanitization",
	  "Lack of proper encoding"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the victim's system. The attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the client system due to the use of NW.js which combines WebKit with Node.js.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious user crafts a group chat name with an embedded template injection payload. When another user in the chat views the crafted chat or sends a message to the malicious user, the payload is executed on their system.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs a valid user account on the Teamwire platform and must be in a group chat with the victim. The attacker must also craft a malicious chat name with the template injection payload."
