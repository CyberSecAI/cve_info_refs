Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2018-17768:

**Vulnerability Details**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an insecure TRACE protocol within Ingenico Tellium 2 devices.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Insecure Protocol:** The TRACE protocol, used for maintenance and debugging, lacks proper security measures.
    *   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The PPP connection used by the maintenance software (LLT) utilizes constant, hardcoded credentials.
    *   **Clear Text Communication:** The custom protocol used for communication is transmitted in clear text, without encryption.
    *   **Constant FTP Credentials:** The FTP server, which the device exposes during maintenance, uses hardcoded credentials (ftp user/ftp password).
    *   **Lack of Encryption:** Communication channels lack encryption, exposing sensitive data.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution:** Exploitation of the insecure protocol and exposed services can allow for remote code execution on the device.
    *   **Data Compromise:** Attackers can potentially intercept and modify payment card data due to the lack of encryption on communication channels.
    *   **Firmware Manipulation:**  The ability to access the device's file system through FTP with hardcoded credentials allows for the upload and modification of firmware.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network Access:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability through network access to the device, specifically targeting the USB port used for maintenance operations.
    *   **USB Sniffing:** Attackers could use a USB sniffer to intercept the clear-text communication and extract the hardcoded credentials.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Proximity:** An attacker needs to be on the same network or have a connection to the payment terminal.
    *   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker would need knowledge of the TRACE protocol, PPP connections, FTP, and potentially reverse engineering skills to fully exploit the vulnerabilities.

**Additional Details:**

*   The content provides more detailed information than the typical CVE description, including specifics about the protocols and credentials involved.
*   The advisory from PT Security indicates that the vendor was notified on 01.09.2018 and released a fix on 01.03.2020.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by researchers from Positive Technologies.
*   The content highlights the risk associated with default or hardcoded credentials in payment terminals.

**Summary of CVE-2018-17768**

The vulnerability in Ingenico Tellium 2 devices arises from an insecure TRACE protocol used for maintenance. This protocol utilizes hardcoded credentials, communicates in clear text, and exposes a vulnerable FTP server. Successful exploitation allows attackers to perform remote code execution, manipulate firmware, and potentially intercept payment data.
