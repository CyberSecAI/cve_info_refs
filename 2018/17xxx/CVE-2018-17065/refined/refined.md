{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `/goform/DDNS` handler of the D-Link DIR-816 A2 router's firmware. The `password` parameter's value, after base64 decoding, is written to the stack without proper length checks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow",
      "Lack of input validation on the length of the base64 decoded password parameter",
      "Use of a fixed memory address on the heap with `rwx` permissions"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can overwrite the return address on the stack, allowing them to execute arbitrary code by injecting shellcode.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/DDNS` endpoint with an overly long, base64 encoded password parameter.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router, typically requiring network access."
  },
  "poc_code": {
        "description": "The provided Python script demonstrates the exploit:",
        "steps": [
            "Fetches the CSRF token from the router's login page.",
            "Constructs the shellcode which will establish a reverse shell to 192.168.0.100:31337.",
            "Creates an HTTP POST request to `/goform/DDNS`.",
            "Adds a base64 encoded, oversized password and other form parameters to the request's body. The oversized password serves to overflow the stack and overwrite the return address.",
            "Inserts the shellcode and padding into the cookie header at a fixed memory location (0x48fc18) with `rwx` permissions.",
            "Sets the return address to point to the injected shellcode in the cookie.",
            "Sends the crafted payload to trigger the vulnerability."
            ]
