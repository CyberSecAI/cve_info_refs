Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Jibu Pro WordPress plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the "Quiz Name" field, before storing it in the database.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the "Quiz Name" field. When a user views a page or post that includes the quiz via shortcode, the injected script will execute in their browser, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Data theft
    *   Other malicious actions within the context of the user's session.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   The attacker must have access to the Jibu Pro plugin administration interface, typically requiring WordPress user with appropriate permissions.
    *   The attacker crafts a malicious payload within the 'name' parameter during creation of a new quiz. The payload is stored in the database.
    *   The payload is executed when a user views a page that renders the quiz using the associated shortcode.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have an account on the vulnerable WordPress site with permissions to access the Jibu Pro plugin's settings.
