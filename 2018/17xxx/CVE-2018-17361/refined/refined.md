The provided content is related to CVE-2018-17361.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the use of `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` to obtain the current script name, which is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflective XSS vulnerability exists due to the insecure use of `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application which will be executed in the context of the victim's browser, allowing them to perform actions like stealing cookies, redirecting users, or defacing the website.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted URL that injects malicious JavaScript into the `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` variable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker only needs the ability to craft a URL with the malicious JavaScript payload to exploit this vulnerability. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
The content provides an example payload: `/"><script>alert(/xss/)</script><a="`. It also suggests using `$_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME']` or `htmlspecialchars()` as mitigation options.
