Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-17985:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a stack consumption issue within the `cplus_demangle_type` function in the `cp-demangle.c` file of the GNU libiberty library. The function makes recursive calls to itself in scenarios involving multiple 'P' characters in the mangled name.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Recursive Stack Frames:** The recursive nature of the `cplus_demangle_type` function leads to uncontrolled stack growth when processing crafted input with repeating 'P' characters, eventually causing a stack exhaustion
- **Lack of Recursion Limit:** The absence of a recursion limit or other input validation mechanisms allows an attacker to cause stack exhaustion by providing an overly complex mangled name with many nested pointer definitions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation leads to stack exhaustion, causing the application to crash. This constitutes a denial-of-service condition, preventing the tool from completing normal operations. This DoS can be triggered by crafted strings in c++filt, nm, objdump, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   The vulnerability can be exploited by supplying a crafted, invalid C++ mangled name as input to tools that use libiberty, such as `c++filt`, `nm`, `objdump`, etc.  The crafted input can cause the recursive `cplus_demangle_type` to consume excessive stack space, resulting in a crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   An attacker must be able to provide input to the vulnerable tool. This can be achieved via various means, including command-line arguments, file input, or other methods where the application processes untrusted input.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The vulnerability is triggered by the presence of many 'P' characters in the mangled name. The character ‘P’  is related to pointers
-   The fix involves adding a recursion limit to the demangling code.
- The issue can be reproduced by the c++filt -t command with a crafted POC file.
- A reproducer may need adjustment to the maximum stack size.
- The vulnerability is related to, and possibly a duplicate of CVE-2018-18484, CVE-2018-18701 and CVE-2018-18700. All are caused by recursive function calls in libiberty's demangling code
