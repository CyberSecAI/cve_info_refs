```
  - Root cause of vulnerability: A heap-based buffer over-read in the `bfd_getl32` function within `libbfd.c`.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Heap-based buffer over-read.
  - Impact of exploitation: A remote attacker could trigger a denial of service (application crash).
  - Attack vectors: Processing a specially crafted PE file using objdump.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to provide a crafted PE file that will be processed by objdump.
