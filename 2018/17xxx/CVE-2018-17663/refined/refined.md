  "CVE-2018-17663": {
    "Description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of the importData method of a Host object. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability exists due to the lack of validating the existence of an object before operating on it within the `importData` method of a Host object.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-After-Free"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process.",
    "Attack vector": "Remote, requires user interaction, either by visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file.",
    "Attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious PDF file or a webpage to trigger this vulnerability when opened by a user.",
     "Additional Details": "The vulnerability is a Use-After-Free. It affects the importData method of Host object. Foxit has released a fix for this vulnerability."
