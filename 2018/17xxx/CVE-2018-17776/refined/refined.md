  "CVE-2018-17776": {
    "description": "PCProtect Anti-Virus v4.8.35 installs by default to \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\PCProtect\" with very weak folder permissions granting any user full permission \"Everyone: (F)\" to the contents of the directory and it's subfolders. In addition, the program installs a service called \"SecurityService\" which runs as \"Local system account\", this will allow any user to escalate privileges to \"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\" by substituting the service's binary with malicious one.",
    "root_cause": "Weak folder permissions on the installation directory and the service executable.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Weak directory permissions allowing any user full access to the installation folder and its subfolders.",
       "Service runs as Local System account, allowing privilege escalation if the service executable is replaced."
    ],
    "impact": "Local privilege escalation to NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local file system access"
    ],
