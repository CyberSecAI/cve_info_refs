Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-17780:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to **CVE-2018-17780**. The blog post from inputzero.io explicitly mentions the CVE ID in the title: "Telegram anonymity fails in desktop - CVE-2018-17780". The blog describes a vulnerability in Telegram Desktop that leaks a user's IP address during calls, which aligns with the vulnerability described in the CVE. Additionally the github page mentions a fix for this in version 1.4.0

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause of the vulnerability lies in how Telegram Desktop (tdesktop) and Telegram for Windows handle peer-to-peer connections during calls.  The applications directly expose the user's IP address, disregarding user privacy settings and the intended behavior of the MTProto protocol.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **IP Address Leakage:** The primary weakness is the exposure of the user's public and private IP addresses during calls. This occurs even when the user has configured the "peer-to-peer" call settings to "nobody". The applications directly connect users, failing to provide anonymity.
    *   **Lack of P2P Control:** Telegram desktop and windows clients did not initially have the option to disable P2P connections, unlike Telegram for Android, where users could configure peer-to-peer settings for calls, This forces users into potentially leaking their IP address.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Privacy Violation:** The most direct impact is the violation of user privacy, as their IP addresses are exposed to the other party during calls.
    *   **OSINT Risk:** Leaked IP addresses can be used for Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) activities, potentially allowing malicious actors to gather more information about the user.
    *   **Targeted Attacks:** The exposed IP addresses could facilitate targeted attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Initiating a call:** Simply initiating or receiving a call through the vulnerable Telegram clients can expose a user's IP address.
    *   **Cross-Platform Leakage:** The vulnerability can occur across different platforms i.e. initiating a call from Windows telegram client to Linux Telegram client would leak the IP Address
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to have the ability to communicate with the victim over the Telegram network, basically, make a call with a victim to expose the IP.
    *   **No special access:**  No special privileges or access to the victim's machine are required.
    *   **Knowledge of the vulnerable application:** The attacker needs to initiate a call via a vulnerable client.

**3. Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects `tdesktop 1.3.14` and `Telegram for Windows (3.3.0.0 WP8.1)`.
*   **Patch:** The vulnerability was addressed in `tdesktop 1.3.17 beta` and `v1.4.0`, which introduced the ability to set "P2P to Nobody/My contacts".
*   **Bounty:** The reporter received a â‚¬2000 bounty from the Telegram security team.

**4. Key Takeaways:**

The core of CVE-2018-17780 revolves around the lack of control over peer-to-peer connections during Telegram calls on desktop and windows clients. This vulnerability resulted in an unintentional leakage of IP addresses, compromising user anonymity. The issue was resolved by providing a "P2P to Nobody" option in the client settings. The vulnerability was present in how the desktop application handled P2P connections during calls. This lack of control over the P2P connection resulted in leaking the end user's public and private IP addresses to the other party.
