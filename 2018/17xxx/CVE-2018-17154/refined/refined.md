- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient checking on the buffer size within the `freebsd4_getfsstat` system call. When a very large buffer size is provided, memory allocation fails, and the code attempts to free a NULL pointer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** NULL pointer dereference due to a failed memory allocation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local, unprivileged user can cause a denial-of-service by triggering a kernel panic using a specially crafted binary that provides a large buffer size to the syscall, which leads to a NULL pointer dereference.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by making a specially crafted `freebsd4_getfsstat` system call with a very large buffer size from a local process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A local unprivileged user can exploit this vulnerability.
