**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-17375

**Vulnerable Software:** Joomla! Component Music Collection

**Vulnerable Version:** 3.0.3

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** SQL Injection vulnerability exists within the Music Collection component for Joomla.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

    - Data exfiltration: Accessing sensitive information stored in the database.
    - Data manipulation: Modifying or deleting data.
    - Privilege escalation: Potentially gaining administrative access.
    - Full database compromise: Depending on the database user's privileges, the entire database can be compromised

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla instance and needs knowledge of the vulnerable path and parameters.
- No special user privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.
