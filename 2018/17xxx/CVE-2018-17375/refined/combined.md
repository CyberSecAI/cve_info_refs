#### [Good but with bad support](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/multimedia/multimedia-players/music-collection/#rev-124782)

[paolo (1).](/profile/profile/details/548060)

Posted on 18 December 2023

###### Functionality

L'estensione ha buone funzionalità anche se possono essere migliorate. Ma comunque è una delle migliori per quello di cui avevo bisogno.

###### Ease of use

Facile da utilizzare sia lato amministrativo, sia lato utente. anche l'aspetto finale è bello seppur con qualche miglioria da fare.

###### Support

Purtroppo si paga per poi non avere un supporto; soprattutto per i bug.

Il supoorto è limitato al forum dove pochi hanno soluzioni

###### Documentation

###### Value for money

Il prezzo sarebbe probabilmente giusto se si ricevesse un adeguato supporto

I used this to:
Ho usato l'estensione per un sito di un cliente e quindi aver fatto pagare il cliente per un'estensione senza supporto è un grosso problema. Non rinnoverà sicuramente l'abbonamento e cambieremo estensione

#### [Not practical and very difficult set up](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/multimedia/multimedia-players/music-collection/#rev-116136)

[Glen Peladeau (1).](/profile/profile/details/528903)

Posted on 24 February 2020

###### Functionality

In today's competitive world with giants like Spotify and others there really is no room for error. The software misses many key ingredients

###### Ease of use

Difficult, especially when setting up the JW player page and dealing with player ID codes on the the JW site to make yours work.

###### Support

The support is sometimes useful, it feels like a one man operation, consider the time zone, on last contact resoultion was unsuccessful.

###### Documentation

Is ok up to the point of dealing with the JW website and integrating the ID code to make it work. There is also no info on JQuery set up.

###### Value for money

Very risky for the average non tech website professional. You will need your own tech support to work with them.

I used this to:
This portion of my site has been closed for 2 years, I never was able to get it fixed. I wanted it to provide a marketing solution for local musicians as well as to promote local independent music.

###### Functionality

Everything ok after the installation. No problems

###### Ease of use

Easy to use and good interface

###### Support

Great support, they answer super fast

###### Documentation

###### Value for money

Good

I used this to:
A client's Hip Hop website

Posted on 13 May 2016

###### Functionality

It works, it works fine but they have you jumping through hoops to get there

###### Ease of use

Pretty darned good once you've got it working.

###### Support

"where did you get it from? my client bought it, "tell them to contact us" , actually they are not that computer literate, hence my question

###### Documentation

out dated and also not very good, "support" (if they'll provide it) rely on you asking them the questions, clients OK, assistants, forget it

###### Value for money

I suppose so, eventually we got it working with the latest version, but what a hassle to get there, buy it is fine, sorting it out phoof!!

I used this to:
a clients website.

MAJOR problem is that a compilation album of songs from previous releases cannot be automatically added, every song is therefore added twice into the database. Needs a bit of work and a change of attitude from the developer towards those who use the componen
Owner's reply:
Hello,

Thanks for taking the time to review Music Collection.

I understand, for what I read, that your main concern is that you couldn't get technical support from us.

We are more than happy to help "assistants", as you mention, but you will understand that we have to verify the accounts to offer technical support.

If you can write to us I'll be glad to review the support questions you're referring to.

You have to understand that we need to know that the user that is requesting support has actually paid for it. There are users using the extension with no license and that's why we have to verify the license. That's why we always ask (even assistants like yourself) to login to our website using the original account that was used to purchase the software in the first place. This way we can separate the real assistants, like you, from other users who just want to get support for free.

I hope you can understand what I'm trying to say here. I don't know who did you speak to in our team, but I'm sure he didn't pretend that the owner of the website logged in himself, but suggested that you, as the technical assistant, could log in using the original account details.

I think this is pretty understandable...

Please, be sure to contact us at support@ joomlathat.com for any further support. Just refer to there mentioning the original discussion (or this review)

Many thanks!

###### Functionality

Works great, especially with the discogs integration. There was a learning curve because its new to me, but everything is straight forward.

###### Ease of use

Everything is laid out and easy to use.

###### Support

They go out of their way to fix issues.

###### Documentation

There are a lot of documentation. Some things are not listed, but what's not listed can be found on their forums.

###### Value for money

Well worth the money. One of a kind software. There is no competition.

I used this to:
Rare and Independent Hip-Hop music releases.

[Tim Heffernan (1).](/profile/profile/details/294745)

Posted on 20 August 2015

###### Functionality

 High Functionality. It surpassed my original specifics for my website adding additional tools I hadn't considered.

###### Ease of use

Extremely easy to use and easily customization. The tagging system written into MC makes it easy for my customers to search my website.

###### Support

Music Collection needed to be customized for my website. Germinal's fast response time and attitude made it happen quickly.

###### Documentation

Very easy to install.

###### Value for money

I am an extremely satisfied customer. Will always be looking at their extensions for future web development.

I used this to:
Radio Theatre. This media player allows my audience to visit and listen to our stories. My multiple production teams no longer need to rely on me for uploading and managing their files.

You can't go wrong with this component. It works great and support is excellent. The response time is great. They go the extra mile for you and hold you by the hand if you are new to this.

Germinal Camps is the best support person I ever interact with.

#### [A very adaptable and useful plug in](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/multimedia/multimedia-players/music-collection/#rev-27940)

[Thomas Giannini (1).](/profile/profile/details/237483)

Posted on 03 June 2014

I use Music Collection to run in my music hosting site. It really is an excellent, bug free, very workable piece of software. And really best of all, I have to ability to contract directly with Germinal Camps - chief developer - to fine tune the extension to meet my exact standards. Think about that. How many Joomla plug-ins offer you the ability to work directly with a team that wrote the code? Germinal knows his stuff and works towards creating any work orders I put to him in a timely, cost effective manner. I hope Music Collection remains in the industry and constantly strives for perfection. So far, we are very please with Music Collection!!

#### [Great Extension](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/multimedia/multimedia-players/music-collection/#rev-27939)

Mr. Camps is a fine example of a Joomla Extension Developer. His Music Collection Extension is powerful and robust and he has even customized it to fit our very specific needs. I can highly recommend this extension, and his work in general. Great job!

Posted on 22 March 2014

Hello! Long had the idea of creating music collection, but since I'm not good programming, you had to look for third-party extensions - all attempts were in vain, until I came across the Music Collection. Question about buying even got - acquired on the same day. And never once regretted. All the functions needed to create a music site, this component is!

A support (in particular Germi) is simply gorgeous. Professionals with a capital letter. Helped to resolve all issues to configure the component. Big thanks to them for that!

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
