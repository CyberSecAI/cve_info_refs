{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "When processing project files, tampering with the value of an offset allows an attacker to force the application to read a value outside of an array.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can force the application to read a value outside of an array. This can lead to information disclosure as the attacker can read from an arbitrary memory location.  The impact is limited to a loss of confidentiality.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when processing a malformed project file. An attacker would need to modify the offset value within the project file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs local access to the system and the ability to trick a user into opening a malicious project file. The attacker also needs a high skill level to create the malicious file."
