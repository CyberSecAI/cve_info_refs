Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-17897:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an integer overflow that leads to a buffer overflow. This occurs because the application fails to properly validate the size of data being used, resulting in a buffer overflow during memory allocation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Integer overflow: Improper calculation or validation of integer values can cause them to wrap around, leading to unexpected results.
- Buffer overflow: Writing data beyond the allocated buffer, leading to memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the target system.
- System Crash: The overflow can lead to a crash.
- Control over system: Exploitation can give an attacker control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability is exploitable remotely, meaning an attacker can exploit it over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs network access to the target system.
- Low skill level: The description indicates that a low skill level is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
