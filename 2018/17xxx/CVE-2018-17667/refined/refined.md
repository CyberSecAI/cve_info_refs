  "CVE-2018-17667": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2018-17667",
      "Description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of the print method of a Host object. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process."
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the insufficient validation of the existence of an object before attempting operations on it within the `print` method of a Host object in Foxit Reader.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Use-After-Free"
      ],
      "Impact": "Remote code execution.",
      "Attack vector": "Remote; through a malicious PDF file or a malicious website.",
        "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker must be able to entice the user to open a specially crafted PDF or visit a malicious webpage that exploits the vulnerability."
