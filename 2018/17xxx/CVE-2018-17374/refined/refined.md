Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The `filter_order` and `filter_order_Dir` parameters in the `com_auctionfactory` component of Joomla are vulnerable to SQL injection. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input sanitization/validation.
- SQL injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database, such as usernames, passwords, and other confidential information.
- An attacker can potentially modify or delete data within the database.
- An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the system.
- Complete compromise of the database and potentially the web server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is accessible via HTTP GET requests.
- The specific vulnerable parameters are `filter_order` and `filter_order_Dir`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla instance.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
The provided exploit example shows that injecting SQL code into the `filter_order` and `filter_order_Dir` parameter leads to SQL execution:

`http://localhost/[PATH]/index.php?option=com_auctionfactory&task=listauctions&filter_order_Dir=[SQL]&filter_order=[SQL]`

The provided SQL payload demonstrates the ability to extract information about the database:

`%2c%45%58%54%52%41%43%54%56%41%4c%55%45%28%36%36%2c%43%4f%4e%43%41%54%28%30%78%35%63%2c%28%53%45%4c%45%43%54%20%28%45%4c%54%28%36%36%3d%36%36%2c%31%29%29%29%2c%43%4f%4e%43%41%54%5f%57%53%28%30%78%32%30%33%61%32%30%2c%55%53%45%52%28%29%2c%44%41%54%41%42%41%53%45%28%29%2c%56%45%52%53%49%4f%4e%28%29%29%29%29`

This payload uses the `EXTRACTVALUE` function in MySQL to extract database version, user and database name.
