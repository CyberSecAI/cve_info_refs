Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-17449:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The events API had an insecure direct object reference (IDOR) issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR): The API did not properly validate access to objects (in this case, event data), allowing unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Disclosure of confidential information: Attackers could access confidential issues, comments, and titles of public projects through the events API.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation of the events API endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the GitLab instance. This could be an authenticated user, or potentially an unauthenticated user if the API endpoint is accessible without authentication (although this is not explicitly stated).
- The attacker would need to manipulate requests to the events API to access data they shouldn't have access to.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by @ngalog.
- The vulnerability affects GitLab CE/EE versions 9.3 and later.
- The issue has been mitigated in the latest release.
