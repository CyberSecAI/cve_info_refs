    "summary": "The provided documents detail CVE-2018-17961, a vulnerability in Ghostscript where saved execution stacks can leak operator arrays, leading to a bypass of the -dSAFER sandbox. This occurs due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2018-17183. An attacker can exploit this by triggering an exception in an executeonly procedure, then causing the error handler invocation to fail. This exposes powerful operators like forceput, which can be used to disable the sandbox and gain arbitrary access. Exploitation can be achieved through crafted PostScript files.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause lies in an incomplete fix for CVE-2018-17183. Although the error handler is no longer directly accessible within the -dSAFER sandbox, the process of setting up the error handler can still be made to fail, leaving the operand stack in an inconsistent state, exposing operators from the saved execution stack.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Incomplete fix for CVE-2018-17183, leaving a path to access operators from saved execution stacks.",
         "The ability to manipulate the operand stack to cause a failure during error handler setup.",
        "Exposed powerful operators (like forceput) that bypass access controls when leaked from stack"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the -dSAFER sandbox in Ghostscript, leading to the ability to read and write arbitrary files, execute arbitrary code, and potentially cause a denial of service. An attacker can gain full control over the affected system.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Processing of specially crafted PostScript files.",
         "Browsing a website that automatically invokes evince-thumbnailer on a specially crafted image containing malicious postscript."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted PostScript file for processing by Ghostscript. In some cases, this can be achieved by tricking a user into opening a malicious document. In configurations where evince-thumbnailer is invoked automatically (e.g., by Nautilus while browsing a directory containing crafted images), no direct user interaction is required for triggering the exploit."
