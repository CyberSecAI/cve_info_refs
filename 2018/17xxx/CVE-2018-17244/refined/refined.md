The provided content discusses CVE-2018-17244, an Elasticsearch information disclosure vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An error in how request headers are applied to requests when using Active Directory, LDAP, Native, or File realms.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect handling of request headers during concurrent user authentication. Specifically, a request may receive headers intended for another request if the same username is being authenticated concurrently. When used with "run as", this could result in a request running as the wrong user.
- This issue results in an information disclosure vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Could allow a user to access information that they should not have access to by impersonating another user.

**Attack vectors:**
- Concurrent authentication of the same username when using Active Directory, LDAP, Native, or File realms.
- Use of the "run as" functionality.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to have a valid username that is also being used for another concurrent authentication.
