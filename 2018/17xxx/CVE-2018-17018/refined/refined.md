{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `time_switch` module in the TP-Link WR886N router allows users to set up scheduled wifi switch tasks via HTTP POST requests. Sending a request with an overly long string value for specific JSON keys will cause a buffer overflow when the module attempts to save this data to the configuration file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer overflow in the `time_switch` module when handling overly long input values. This also leads to a denial of service condition.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The buffer overflow crashes the `inetd` task, which is responsible for handling most network services, resulting in a denial of service that stops HTTP, DNS and UPnP services.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the router's web interface with a long string value in the `time_switch` module's JSON payload, specifically within the 'name' parameter. The vulnerability is triggered when the `time_switch` module saves the oversized data to the configuration file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface, which typically means they need to be on the same network as the router or have some form of access to it (e.g., through a network vulnerability). They also need to be able to authenticate to the device or exploit it without authentication. The PoC uses a hardcoded password ('zaq12wsx')."
