Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `admin/share_switch.php` file of OTCMS 3.61. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the `fieldName`, `fieldName2`, and `tabName` parameters. Specifically, the value of `fieldName2` is directly inserted into a JavaScript string within double quotes in the application's response, without any encoding or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS.  The application echoes back the unsanitized input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Administrator Cookie Theft:** The attacker can steal administrator cookies.
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:**  Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could be used to redirect users, deface websites, or perform other malicious actions.
- **Further Exploitation:** The injected JavaScript could be used to perform further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **URL Manipulation:** The attack is performed by crafting a malicious URL that includes the XSS payload in the vulnerable parameters (`fieldName`, `fieldName2`, or `tabName`).
- **Social Engineering:** The victim would need to be tricked into clicking on the malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable parameters (`fieldName`, `fieldName2`, and `tabName`) within the `admin/share_switch.php` file.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker must be able to create URLs containing the XSS payload.
- **Social Engineering Skills (or similar):** The attacker needs to get the victim to visit the malicious URL.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided example demonstrates the vulnerability using the `fieldName2` parameter, showcasing the injection of `diz66</script><script>alert(1)</script>cbu9g`.
- The source code for `admin/users.php` is provided, which calls the `SwitchDeal` function from `admin/share_switch.php`. This function is where the vulnerable parameters are processed.
- The blog post contains a proof of concept showing the XSS vulnerability.
- The blog post mentions that similar vulnerabilities exist in other parts of the system.
