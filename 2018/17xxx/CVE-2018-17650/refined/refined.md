Additionally, the reports detail issues with untrusted URL invocations, incorrect signature verification, and information disclosure vulnerabilities related to XFA document processing, as well as the lack of proper validation and permission settings during installation and updates which could lead to privilege escalation. These issues could allow attackers to execute malicious actions under users’ systems or to manipulate document content and deceive users.",
