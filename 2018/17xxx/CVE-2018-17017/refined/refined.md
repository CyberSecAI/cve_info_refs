```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `dhcpd` module saves DHCP parameters to a configuration file. Sending a request with a long string value for a specific JSON key will cause a buffer overflow when writing to the configuration file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Buffer Overflow"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A buffer overflow in the configuration file leads to the crash of the `inetd` task, which in turn stops most network services, such as HTTP, DNS, and UPnP.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending an HTTP POST request with a crafted JSON payload containing overly long string values for specific DHCP parameters.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router's web interface. This implies network connectivity with the router's management interface, which is often on the local network."
