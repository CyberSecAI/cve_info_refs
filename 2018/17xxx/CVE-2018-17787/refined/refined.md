The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in the D-Link DIR-823G router firmware, but not any specific CVE.

Here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerabilities:

**1. Unauthenticated CGI Access:**

*   **Vulnerability:**  CGI scripts within the `/cgi-bin` directory lack authentication, allowing unauthorized users to access them.
*   **Weakness:** Missing access controls on CGI scripts.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** `/cgi-bin/ExportSettings.sh` allows exporting the router's configuration, potentially exposing sensitive information. `/cgi-bin/GetDownLoadSyslog.sh` exposes system logs.
    *   **Configuration Tampering:**  `/cgi-bin/upload_settings.cgi` allows importing configuration files, enabling malicious users to alter router settings.
    *   **Firmware Manipulation:**  `/cgi-bin/upload_firmware.cgi` allows uploading new firmware, which could be maliciously crafted.
*   **Attack Vector:** Direct access to the mentioned CGI scripts via HTTP requests.
*   **Attacker Capability:** No authentication is needed; an attacker with network access to the router can exploit this.

**2. Command Injection in `goahead` custom handler:**

*   **Vulnerability:**  The `/HNAP1` URL handler within the `goahead` web server uses `snprintf` and `system` to log POST data. This allows for command injection via the POST data.
*   **Root Cause:** Improper handling of user-supplied data in log generation using `system` function.
*  **Weakness**: Usage of `system` with unsanitized input from POST data.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the router's operating system.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a specially crafted POST request to the `/HNAP1` endpoint with malicious commands.
*   **Attacker Capability:** An attacker with network access to the router can send HTTP POST requests to the `/HNAP1` endpoint.

**3. Unauthenticated Reboot via `/HNAP1`:**

*   **Vulnerability:** The `RunReboot` action in the `/HNAP1` interface is accessible without authentication.
*   **Weakness:** Missing access control on the reboot functionality.
*   **Impact:**  An attacker can continuously reboot the router, causing a denial-of-service (DoS).
*   **Attack Vector:**  Sending a SOAP request to the `/HNAP1` endpoint with the `RunReboot` action.
*   **Attacker Capability:** No authentication is needed; an attacker with network access to the router can send the crafted request.

**4. Unauthenticated Password Change via `/HNAP1`:**

*   **Vulnerability:**  The `SetPasswdSettings` action in the `/HNAP1` interface is accessible without authentication, allowing modification of the administrator password.
*   **Weakness:** Missing access control on the password change functionality.
*  **Impact:**  An attacker can change the administrator password and gain complete control over the router.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Sending a SOAP request to the `/HNAP1` endpoint with the `SetPasswdSettings` action and a new password.
*   **Attacker Capability:** No authentication is needed; an attacker with network access to the router can send the crafted request.

In summary, the content describes multiple critical vulnerabilities in D-Link DIR-823G router, including unauthenticated access to sensitive functions, command injection, and a potential denial of service, however, none of these are related to CVE-2018-17787.
