Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an open redirect vulnerability in dotCMS V5.0.1 due to the application not properly validating or sanitizing the redirect URL provided in the `FORWARD_URL` parameter of `forward_js.jsp` and `hostname` parameter of `page_preview_popup.jsp`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unvalidated redirect parameters: The application accepts user-supplied URLs in the `FORWARD_URL` and `hostname` parameters without proper validation or sanitization. This allows attackers to control the redirection target.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Phishing attacks: Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites, potentially impersonating legitimate services and stealing credentials or other sensitive information.
- Arbitrary redirects: Attackers can redirect users to any arbitrary web site.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious URL: An attacker crafts a malicious URL with the `FORWARD_URL` or `hostname` parameter set to a malicious target.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker only needs the ability to construct a malicious URL to send to a victim. No specific privilege level is required beyond being able to send a link to a user.
