  "cve": "CVE-2018-17205",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in Open vSwitch (OvS) 2.7.x through 2.7.6, 2.8.x through 2.8.4, and 2.9.x through 2.9.2. During bundle commit, flows that are added in a bundle are applied to ofproto in order. If a flow cannot be added (e.g., the flow action is a go-to for a group id that does not exist), OvS tries to revert back all previous flows that were successfully applied from the same bundle. This is possible since OvS maintains list of old flows that were replaced by flows from the bundle. While reinserting old flows, OvS has an assertion failure due to a check on rule state != RULE_INITIALIZED. This would work for new flows, but for an old flow the rule state is RULE_REMOVED. The assertion failure causes an OvS crash.",
  "affected_versions": "2.7.x through 2.7.6, 2.8.x through 2.8.4, and 2.9.x through 2.9.2",
  "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `ofproto_rule_insert__` function within `ofproto/ofproto.c`. When a bundle commit fails, OVS attempts to revert previously applied flows, but an incorrect check on the rule state during reinsertion causes an assertion failure and subsequent crash.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Assertion failure during flow rule reinsertion within bundle commit operations due to incorrect state check."
  ],
    "impact": "A specially crafted flow update using the bundling feature of Open vSwitch can cause an assertion failure, leading to a denial of service (crash).",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "A specially crafted flow update applied using the bundling feature of Open vSwitch."
  ],
  "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to create and apply Open vSwitch flows in a way that uses the bundling feature.",
  "patch": "The fix involves modifying the OVS assertion check to `!= RULE_INSERTED` in the `ofproto_rule_insert__` function. This allows both new and old rules to be inserted without triggering the assertion.",

  ],
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability can be triggered by using `ovs-ofctl bundle` with a set of commands, where one rule is valid and another is invalid, and the system will crash while trying to revert the valid one."
