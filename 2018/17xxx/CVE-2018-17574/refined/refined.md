The provided content is related to CVE-2018-17574.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue in the "Project Name" field of the YAPI application. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input for the project name, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Lack of proper input sanitization of the Project Name field.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- When a user (including managers and administrators) views project operation dynamics where the project name is displayed, the injected malicious JavaScript code is executed in their browser. This could lead to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Stealing of sensitive information (e.g., cookies, credentials)
  - Defacement of the application
  - Redirecting users to malicious sites
  - Other client-side attacks

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker must have an account in the YAPI application.
- The attacker creates a new project and sets the project name to a malicious payload (e.g., `xss"><img src=1 onerror=alert(/xss/)>`).
- The attacker sets the project as public, allowing anyone to view it.
- The attacker puts the project in a public group.
- When a user views the operation dynamics of this project (where the project name is displayed), the XSS payload is executed in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-  An attacker needs to be a registered user of the vulnerable YAPI instance.
- The attacker needs to be able to create projects and set their name.
- The attacker needs to be able to set the project to public and put it in a public group, to be viewable by other users.
