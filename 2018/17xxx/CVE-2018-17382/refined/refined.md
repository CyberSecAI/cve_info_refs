Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-17382:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw within the `com_jobsfactory` component of the Joomla! CMS. Specifically, the `filter_letter` parameter in the `categories` task is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to:
    -  Extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames, passwords, and other confidential data.
    -  Potentially modify or delete data within the database.
    -  Gain control of the application/database server in severe cases.
    -  The provided exploit examples demonstrate the ability to retrieve the database version, database name, and user information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes a malicious SQL payload in the `filter_letter` parameter. Specifically the vulnerable URL is: `http://localhost/[PATH]/index.php?option=com_jobsfactory&task=categories&filter_letter=[SQL]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla! application.
- No specific privileges on the application are mentioned, suggesting the vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates the usage of specific SQL injection techniques:
    - `EXTRACTVALUE`: Used to extract data from XML using XPath queries, which in this case is used to retrieve database version, database, and user information by concatenating the results.
    - `CONCAT`: Used to concatenate strings, in this case SQL results, to retrieve more than one value at the same time.
    - `ELT`: Used to return a string from a list. It is used to simulate a boolean result by returning 1 if the condition is true.
    - `FLOOR`: Used to return the largest integer not greater than the given number, used here for information gathering.
    - `RAND`: Used to get a random number between 0 and 1, used in conjunction with the floor function to gather data.
- The exploit uses URL encoding to deliver the SQL payloads.
- The vulnerability exists in the `filter_letter` parameter of the `com_jobsfactory` component of Joomla!.

**Affected Component:**
- Joomla! Component Jobs Factory version 2.0.4.

**Additional Notes:**
- The Joomla! Extensions Directory lists this extension as unpublished due to "Broken Links."
