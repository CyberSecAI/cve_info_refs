{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the way CouchDB handles user-supplied JavaScript code within its map/reduce view engine.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation of user-supplied JavaScript code",
      "Insufficient sandboxing of the JavaScript execution environment"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by crafting malicious JavaScript functions. This can lead to privilege escalation, data breaches, and complete system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote execution of crafted JavaScript functions via the CouchDB API.",
       "Leveraging the map/reduce view engine to inject malicious code."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to create or modify design documents within CouchDB. This typically requires administrative privileges or compromised credentials."
