Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described for CVE-2018-17210:

**Root Cause:**
The PrinterOn web application (versions 4.1.4 and lower) fails to implement proper session validation checks on several critical webpages responsible for managing print job workflows. This lack of validation allows unauthenticated (guest) users to access and manipulate functionalities that should be restricted to authenticated users with higher privileges (regular or administrative users).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Authorization Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is an authorization bypass, where access controls are not enforced correctly, allowing unprivileged users to perform privileged actions.
- **Missing Session Validation:** The application lacks proper session validation mechanisms on key URLs involved in the print job workflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker, by exploiting this vulnerability, can:
- **Manipulate Print Jobs:** Submit print jobs to arbitrary printers.
- **Bypass Access Controls:** Perform actions they would otherwise be prevented from doing as a guest user.
- **Access Privileged Functions:** Leverage functionalities normally reserved for authenticated users with higher privileges.
- **Potential resource exhaustion:** Attackers can possibly submit large amounts of print jobs to exhaust printer resources, however it is not specifically mentioned.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves sending specifically crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable URLs. The attacker can:
1. Obtain a `JOB_ID` from the application without authentication.
2. Submit a document to be printed, setting job parameters, again without proper authorization.
3. Initiate the printing process.
4. Submit the job to the servlet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the PrinterOn web application server.
-   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need a valid user account to exploit the vulnerability, as the exploit relies on bypassing authorization checks.
-   **Understanding of vulnerable URLs:** An attacker must understand and leverage the vulnerable URLs of the web application.

**Technical Details:**

The provided exploit steps demonstrate the following:
1.  A guest user can retrieve a `JOB_ID` without proper authentication through the `/cps/servlet/StoreOptions` URL, using their guest `JSESSIONID` cookie.
2.  The guest user can submit a document using a multipart POST request to `/cps/servlet/StoreOptions` and set print job parameters using the obtained `JOB_ID`.
3.  The guest user can then initiate the print job using `/cps/iframe/Submit` and the `JOB_ID` using their guest session.
4.  Finally the attacker can submit the job to print using `/cps/servlet/SubmitRequestServlet`.

This sequence of requests, all performed with a guest session, results in a print job being submitted to the printer, demonstrating the complete bypass of authentication and authorization. The vulnerable URLs include:
    - `/cps/SelectPrinter`
    - `/cps/servlet/StoreOptions`
    - `/cps/iframe/Submit`
    - `/cps/servlet/SubmitRequestServlet`
