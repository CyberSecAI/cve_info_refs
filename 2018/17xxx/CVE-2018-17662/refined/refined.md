  "date": "2018-10-11",
  "content": "The content provided by the vendor describes a Use-After-Free vulnerability in Foxit Reader when handling the beep method of a Host object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. This is due to the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. This content provides more technical details than the official CVE description.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of the existence of an object before performing operations on it within the `beep` method of a `Host` object.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-After-Free"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "The attack vector involves either visiting a malicious web page or opening a malicious PDF file specially crafted to trigger the vulnerable code path."
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": [
      "The attacker needs to craft a malicious PDF document or a malicious web page that triggers the vulnerable code path.",
       "User interaction is required in the form of opening the crafted document or visiting the malicious webpage."
