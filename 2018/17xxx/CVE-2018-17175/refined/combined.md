### @lafrech **[lafrech](/lafrech)** commented [Apr 19, 2018](#issue-315923404)

Implementation of the fix described in [#772 (comment)](https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/issues/772#issuecomment-380975300).

I also reworded the docstring a bit (this is a rework of [#771](https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/pull/771) which hopefully should close [#535](https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/issues/535)). I'm open to suggestions for a better wording.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| I don't know if we have a rule to express the `:param` types in the docstrings.  Since the text said "tuple or list" I figured I'd use `tuple|list` as type and remove this from the sentence.  But I might as well be listing all collection types... Maybe tuple was enough and the user can imagine a list will fit as well.  Later in the file, only tuple is specified:  ```     def validate(self, data, many=None, partial=None):         """Validate `data` against the schema, returning a dictionary of         validation errors.         [...]         :param bool|tuple partial: Whether to ignore missing fields. If `None`,             the value for `self.partial` is used. If its value is an iterable, ```  No big deal anyway. Just trying to get it right. |

| Yes, this should be sent to the 2.x-line branch.  Since the text said "tuple or list" I figured I'd use tuple|list as type and remove this from the sentence.  Good idea.  [@lafrech](https://github.com/lafrech) Would you mind resending this to `2.x-line`? |

## Description

[![@deckar01](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3108007?u=9bd0877aeb4f1fd900488b3e5e4bec763c6827a1&v=4&size=48)](/deckar01)[deckar01](https://github.com/deckar01)opened [on Apr 12, 2018](https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/issues/772#issue-313917994)

When the `only` parameter is an empty list/set, it causes all the fields to be de/serialized like `None`. The implementation of 2.x and 3.0 are not in compliance with their respective docs.

> **only** (*tuple*) – A list or tuple of fields to serialize. If **None**, all fields will be serialized.

```
class TestSchema(Schema):
    foo = fields.Field()
sch = TestSchema(only=())
data = dict(foo='bar')
result = sch.dump(data)
assert 'foo' not in result

# assert 'foo' not in {'foo': 'bar'}
```

This could create a security vulnerability if an application was dynamically generating the field set based on security role. A filter that was meant to hide everything would inadvertently show everything.

[Vulnerability details](/advisories/GHSA-9q2p-fj49-vpxj)
[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-9q2p-fj49-vpxj/dependabot)

## Package

pip

marshmallow
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.15.1
>= 3.0a0, < 3.0.0b9

## Patched versions

2.15.1
3.0.0b9

## Description

In the marshmallow library before 2.15.1 and 3.x before 3.0.0b9 for Python, the schema "only" option treats an empty list as implying no "only" option, which allows a request that was intended to expose no fields to instead expose all fields (if the schema is being filtered dynamically using the "only" option, and there is a user role that produces an empty value for "only").

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

## Accelerate performance

With GitHub Copilot embedded throughout the platform, you can simplify your toolchain, automate tasks, and improve the developer experience.

![](https://github.githubassets.com/assets/particles-de1dd20f3008.png)A Copilot chat window with extensions enabled. The user inputs the @ symbol to reveal a list of five Copilot Extensions. @Sentry is selected from the list, which shifts the window to a chat directly with that extension. There are three sample prompts at the bottom of the chat window, allowing the user to Get incident information, Edit status on incident, or List the latest issues. The last one is activated to send the prompt: @Sentry List the latest issues. The extension then lists several new issues and their metadata.
