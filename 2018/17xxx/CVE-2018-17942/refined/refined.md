Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-17942:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an insufficient buffer allocation in the `convert_to_decimal` function within `vasnprintf.c`. The function calculates the required memory to store the decimal representation of a floating-point number, but the calculation doesn't account for the null terminator, leading to a heap-buffer-overflow when the string is terminated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow: The `malloc` call in `convert_to_decimal` doesn't allocate enough space to store the converted string, leading to writing past the allocated buffer.
- Incorrect memory calculation: The algorithm to compute the buffer size for the converted decimal representation does not account for the null byte.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Memory corruption: A heap-buffer-overflow can corrupt heap metadata, other data structures in memory, or lead to other unexpected behavior.
- Program crash: The overflow, especially when detected by sanitizers, leads to program termination.
- Potential arbitrary code execution: In certain cases, heap corruption can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Format string vulnerability via `%f` specifier: When using `vasnprintf` or related functions with `%f` format specifiers, specific floating-point values can trigger the vulnerable code path in `convert_to_decimal`. The specific values that trigger the overflow need to result in a long enough output.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need the ability to control the format string and arguments passed to a function that uses `vasnprintf` or its variants, such as `snprintf`, `asprintf`, or `fprintf`.
- The attacker needs to craft specific floating-point numbers (e.g. large or small exponents) that result in long decimal representations, which are then processed by the vulnerable `convert_to_decimal` function in `vasnprintf`.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Ben Pfaff.
*   The issue was initially found in the PSPP project, which uses `gnulib`.
*   The fix involves allocating an additional byte of memory in `convert_to_decimal` to accommodate the null terminator.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple Fedora versions.
