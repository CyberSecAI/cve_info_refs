Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-17155:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient initialization of memory when copying data to userland within the `getcontext` and `swapcontext` system calls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Memory Disclosure:** Kernel memory is being copied to user space without proper initialization, potentially leaking sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An unprivileged local user can craft a program to read small portions of kernel memory.
- **Potential Privilege Escalation:** The leaked memory might contain sensitive information, such as file cache data, terminal buffers (potentially including passwords), which could be directly valuable or used to further exploit the system and gain elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system.
- **System Calls:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability via the `getcontext` and `swapcontext` system calls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unprivileged User:** The attacker only needs to be an unprivileged user on the affected FreeBSD system.
- **Ability to execute code:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the system to call the vulnerable system calls

**Summary:**
This vulnerability allows a local, unprivileged user to potentially read portions of kernel memory by abusing the `getcontext` and `swapcontext` system calls due to insufficient memory initialization before being copied to user space. This leaked memory could contain sensitive information that an attacker could use for further exploitation.
