    "related_to_description": true,
    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Foxit PhantomPDF. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the conversion of HTML files to PDF. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the application's improper handling of user-supplied data during the conversion of HTML files to PDF, specifically the lack of validation that results in reading beyond the boundaries of an allocated object.",
     "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
       "Improper validation of user-supplied data"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the currently running process.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Visiting a malicious webpage",
      "Opening a malicious PDF file"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
