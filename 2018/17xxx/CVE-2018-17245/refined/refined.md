Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-17245:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Kibana reporting feature, when generating PDF reports, unintentionally includes user authentication credentials in the HTTP headers used to request data from external resources.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Credential Exposure:** User credentials (Kibana username and password, stored in a reversible hashed format) are transmitted in HTTP headers when Kibana requests data from external resources for PDF reports.
- **Lack of Proper Handling of Credentials:**  Credentials intended for Elasticsearch authentication are improperly passed to external resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential Leakage:** User credentials, although hashed, are exposed to external resource providers. This allows the external resource to potentially use these credentials.
- **Unauthorized Access:** If the external resource provider logs or otherwise stores these credentials, the user's account may be compromised if the external resource provider's systems are compromised. This could lead to unauthorized access to the Kibana instance, the Elasticsearch server, or any other resource where the same credentials are used.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  **External Resource Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered when a Kibana PDF report includes data from external resources. This includes web proxies, Kibana URL field formatters, Timelion visualizations, markdown, Vega visualizations, and mapping services. An attacker controlling any of these external resources can receive the user's credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **External Resource Control:** An attacker would need control over an external resource that Kibana accesses when generating PDF reports.
- **Passive Attack:** The attack can be passive, meaning that the attacker simply needs to observe the HTTP headers of requests sent from Kibana to their external resource. They do not need to actively try to exploit a weakness in Kibana, but rather they just need to be an external resource that is used by the reporting function.

**Additional Details:**
- The credentials are not transmitted in plaintext, but are in a reversibly hashed format, which makes them vulnerable to cracking or reuse.
- The issue affects Kibana versions 4.0 to 4.6, 5.0 to 5.6.12, and 6.0 to 6.4.2 of the Elastic Stack.
- The vulnerability only occurs when using the PDF reporting feature with external resources and not CSV reports.

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to Elastic Stack versions 5.6.13 or 6.4.3.
- As a temporary measure, disable the Kibana Reporting feature by setting `xpack.reporting.enabled` to `false` in the `kibana.yml` file.
- Change affected user credentials across the different authentication realms (Native, File, LDAP, and Active Directory).
- Expire SAML refresh tokens (for SAML realm users).
