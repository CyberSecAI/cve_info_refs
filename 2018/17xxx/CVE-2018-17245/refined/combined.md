# Elastic Support Alert: Kibana Reporting Vulnerability

By[Elastic Engineering](/blog/author/elastic-engineering)

Share

* Share on Twitter

* Share on LinkedInr

Elastic has recently identified that the Kibana reporting feature used to generate PDF reports unintentionally transmits user authentication credentials (i.e., Kibana username and password in reversible hashed format) in the HTTP headers used to request data from external resources whose data may be incorporated into the report.

## Background

User credentials are encrypted at rest by Kibana and are intended for use to authenticate to an Elasticsearch server to generate reports but are not intended to be transmitted to external resources. However, in this case, the HTTP headers used to request data from external resources in connection with the Kibana PDF reporting feature also included user credentials. The types of external resources or services that may be reported in Kibana include web proxies, Kibana URL field formatters, Timelion visualizations, markdown, Vega visualizations and mapping services.

To address this issue we have released ESA-2018-17 (CVE-2018-17245), Elastic Stack versions 5.6.13 and 6.4.3 contain fixes for this issue.

### Affected Users

This issue affects Kibana users on versions 4.0 to 4.6, 5.0 to 5.6.12, and 6.0 to 6.4.2 of the Elastic Stack for both self-managed and hosted deployments. It affects users who have used Kibana’s PDF reporting feature to include data from external resources. It is not triggered by requests to generate CSV reports.

### Recommend Changing User Credentials

While requests to some of the external resources may have been conducted via HTTPS using encryption, there can be no assurance that all requests were encrypted and, in any event, the credential would have been exposed to external resource provider following receipt of such request. We note that we are not aware of any unauthorized use or access associated with any of the affected user credentials. Nevertheless, consistent with security best practices and as a precautionary measure, we recommend that all affected users change affected credentials.

## Recommended Actions

If you are an affected Kibana user (i.e., (i) you have used Kibana’s PDF reporting feature to include data from external resources) and (ii) you are on one of the affected versions described above, then you should consider changing your credential as described below.

### Native Realm

This recommendation applies where users have used the "native" registration feature of the Elastic Stack, i.e., have registered using the Kibana user management interface and have created a unique username and password at the time of registration. If you are native realm user of Kibana then your user details are stored in an Elasticsearch index. This means that the individual user can change his or her credentials directly using the Kibana user management interface or, alternatively, the Elastic Stack administrator can change all user credentials via an Elasticsearch [API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.4/security-api-change-password.html).

Please note that native is the default security realm for customers of our Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud.

### File Realm

This recommendation applies where the Elastic Stack is configured to use file based user authentication. Users are managed via the ‘user’ command line utility shipped with Elasticsearch. The Elastic Stack administrator must change all user credentials using command line tools.

### LDAP and Active Directory Realms

This recommendation applies where the Elastic Stack administrator has enabled user registration utilizing user credentials stored in LDAP and Active Directory. Because these user credentials affect more services than just the Elastic Stack, all affected users should be instructed to change their user credentials for LDAP and Active Directory.

### SAML Realm

The SAML realm is not affected by the plaintext disclosure flaw, but a session replay attack does affect the SAML realm. The SAML realm uses a pair of tokens: *access tokens* and *refresh tokens*. Access tokens are short lived (20 mins), but refresh tokens can be valid for at most 24 hours and can be used to get new access tokens. To address this potential attack, we have provided instructions (later in this blog) on how to expire SAML refresh tokens.

### PKI and Kerberos Realms

The PKI and Kerberos realms are not compatible with Kibana at this time and are not affected by this flaw.

### Custom Realms

If you have a custom realm you should review the authentication process to decide what actions should be taken.

## Instructions for Expiring SAML Refresh Tokens

Depending on number of tokens/users you may need to scroll. This is per SAML realm:

```
curl -uelastic -X GET "https://localhost:9200/.security/_search?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
    "query": {
        "bool": {
            "filter": [
              { "term": { "doc_type": "token" } },
              { "term": { "access_token.realm": "<NAME OF SAML REALM>" } },
              { "term": { "refresh_token.invalidated": false } }
            ]
        }
    },
    "_source": ["refresh_token.token"]
}
'

```

Each result from this query will contain a refresh token that needs to be invalidated. Invalidate each token by:

```
curl -uelastic -X DELETE "https://localhost:9200/_xpack/security/oauth2/token" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "refresh_token" : "<REFRESH TOKEN HERE>"
}
'

```
## Going Forward

Elasticsearch 5.6.13, 6.4.3, and above come with a bug fix for this vulnerability. If you are unable to upgrade, be sure to follow the recommended actions above.

**Elasticsearch information disclosure (ESA-2018-16)**

Elasticsearch Security versions 6.4.0 to 6.4.2 contain an error in the way request headers are applied to requests when using the Active Directory, LDAP, Native, or File realms. A request may receive headers intended for another request if the same username is being authenticated concurrently; when used with run as, this can result in the request running as the incorrect user. This could allow a user to access information that they should not have access to.

**Affected Versions**

Elasticsearch Security versions 6.4.0, 6.4.1, and 6.4.2

**Solutions and Mitigations:**

Users should upgrade to Elasticsearch version 6.4.3.

If upgrading is not possible setting the realm’s cache.ttl option to 0 will prevent caching any user data. This will mitigate this issue but will slow requests considerably.

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-17244

---

**Kibana credential exposure (ESA-2018-17)**

Yuri Astrakhan and Nick Peihl of Elastic discovered Kibana versions 4.0 to 4.6, 5.0 to 5.6.12, and 6.0 to 6.4.2 contain an error in the way authorization credentials are used when generating PDF reports. If a report requests external resources plaintext credentials are included in the HTTP request that could be recovered by an external resource provider.

**Affected Versions**

Kibana versions 4.6 to 6.4.2 and 5.6.12

**Solutions and Mitigations**

Users should upgrade to Elastic Stack version 6.4.3 or 5.6.13

Users unable to upgrade can disable the Reporting feature in Kibana by setting xpack.reporting.enabled to false in the kibana.yml file. This does not prevent previously leaked credentials from being reused.

For more information about mitigating from this flaw please see our [blog post](https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-support-alert-kibana-reporting-vulnerability).

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-17245

---

**Kibana arbitrary file inclusion (ESA-2018-18)**

Nethanel Coppenhagen of CyberArk Labs discovered Kibana versions before 6.4.3 and 5.6.13 contain an arbitrary file inclusion flaw in the Console plugin. An attacker with access to the Kibana Console API could send a request that will attempt to execute javascript code. This could possibly lead to an attacker executing arbitrary commands with permissions of the Kibana process on the host system.

**Affected Versions**

Kibana versions after 5.0

**Solutions and Mitigations**

Users should upgrade to Elastic Stack version 6.4.3 or 5.6.13

Users unable to upgrade can disable the Kibana Console plugin. The Console plugin can be disabled by setting “console.enabled: false” in the kibana.yml file.

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-17246

# Security issues

## Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure

Elastic values our partnership with the security community and shares the goal of keeping our users and the internet safe. Please report potential security vulnerabilities affecting any of Elastic's products, the Elastic Cloud Service, or the elastic.co website via our [HackerOne bug bounty program](https://hackerone.com/elastic?type=team). For detailed scope and rules of engagement please refer to our HackerOne program [policy](https://hackerone.com/elastic?view_policy=true).

Under the principles of Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure, Elastic analyzes potential security vulnerabilities to identify any recommended mitigations or product updates and coordinates disclosures via Elastic Security Advisories (ESA) and the CVE program. Elastic requests that you do not post or share any information about potential vulnerabilities in any public forum until we have researched and responded to the issue.

## Other security issues

Users and customers may report any other potential security issues to security@elastic.co. This address can be used for product security related inquiries or requests about other security topics that are not explicitly mentioned here. We can accept only security issues at this address. Bug reports should be directed to the bug database of the project you're reporting it on or raised to Elastic Support.

If you would like to encrypt your message to us, please use our PGP key. The fingerprint is

1224 D1A5 72A7 3755 B61A 377B 14D6 5EE0 D2AE 61D2

The key is available via keyservers; search for 'security@elastic.co'. [Example on OpenPGP](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=security%40elastic.co)

## Elastic Security Advisories

An Elastic Security Advisory (ESA) is an announcement about a security issue with one or more Elastic products. Elastic assigns a CVE and an ESA identifier to each advisory and publishes a summary of the issue with remediation and mitigation details. All new advisories are announced in the [Security Announcements](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/announcements/security-announcements) forum. Subscribe to these announcements by clicking the bell icon and selecting 'Watching' on the forum page or, alternatively, via the [RSS feed](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/announcements/security-announcements.rss).
