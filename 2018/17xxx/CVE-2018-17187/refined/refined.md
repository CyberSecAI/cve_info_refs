Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-17187:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of implementation of hostname verification in the TLS wrapper of the Qpid Proton-J library. While the library offered a configuration option for hostname verification (`VerifyMode#VERIFY_PEER_NAME`), it was not actually implemented. This left users with the option to only verify if the certificate is trusted, which is not sufficient to prevent MITM attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Missing Hostname Verification:** The core weakness is the lack of proper hostname verification when using TLS. The library was supposed to provide this functionality but failed to implement it, despite offering a related configuration setting.
* **Defaulting to Insecure Mode:** While not explicitly a vulnerability, the documented behavior of the library defaulted to not verifying a peer certificate unless explicitly configured, which made users more vulnerable if not familiar with TLS best practices.
* **Reliance on Certificate Trust Alone:** The implemented certificate verification only checked if the certificate was signed by a trusted authority. It did not ensure that the certificate actually belonged to the server being connected to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:**  An attacker could perform a MITM attack by intercepting network traffic and presenting a valid, but malicious certificate. Since the client did not verify the hostname on the certificate, the client would trust the malicious server as if it was the intended destination.
* **Data Breach:** By successfully performing a MITM attack, an attacker can eavesdrop on, or modify, sensitive communication between the client and server.
* **Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability:** The lack of hostname verification can lead to a total loss of the security triade.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Network-Based:** The attack requires an attacker to be positioned on the network path between a vulnerable client and a server using the affected version of Qpid Proton-J and using TLS, without enabling proper hostname verification.
* **MITM:** The attacker must be capable of intercepting network traffic, and generating and presenting a valid certificate that the client trusts, but is associated to a hostname different from the intended one.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Network Access:** The attacker must have the ability to intercept network traffic.
* **Certificate Spoofing (MITM):** The attacker must be able to acquire or create a certificate that will be trusted by the client (e.g. one signed by a trusted CA), even though it does not belong to the intended server.
* **Active Interception:** The attacker needs to be actively intercepting and redirecting the client's network traffic.

**Additional Details:**
* **Affected Versions:** Qpid Proton-J versions 0.3 to 0.29.0 are affected.
* **Fix Version:** The issue is fixed in version 0.30.0 of Qpid Proton-J.
* **Resolution:** The fix implements `VerifyMode#VERIFY_PEER_NAME` and defaults to this setting for client mode unless configured otherwise.
* **Mitigation:** If upgrading was not possible, workarounds include providing a custom SSLContext which enables hostname verification, or avoiding the use of `transport.ssl(...)` and instead implementing TLS via other means.
* **Not Impacted:** Usage of the Proton-J protocol engine without the TLS wrapper is not impacted.

**In summary**, CVE-2018-17187 highlights a critical vulnerability where Qpid Proton-J failed to implement hostname verification during TLS connections, allowing for MITM attacks. The fix involved enabling and defaulting to hostname verification, emphasizing the importance of proper TLS implementation.
