Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization/filtering of multiple input parameters in the `admin_video.php` file. Specifically, the `action`, `area`, `type`, `yuyan`, `jqtype`, `v_isunion`, `v_recycled`, `v_ismoney`, and `v_ispsd` parameters are vulnerable. User-supplied input from these parameters are directly reflected back in the HTML response without proper encoding, leading to XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. The application reflects the unsanitized user-provided input, allowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- **Multiple Vulnerable Parameters:** The vulnerability is present in multiple parameters of the `admin_video.php` script, increasing the attack surface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Administrator Cookie Theft:** An attacker can steal the administrator's session cookie, gaining unauthorized access to the admin panel.
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject any JavaScript payload, which can be used for a wide range of malicious activities, such as defacement, redirection, and further attacks against the server or other users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URL:** Attackers craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload within one of the vulnerable parameters.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker tricks a logged-in administrator into clicking the malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable parameters within the `admin_video.php` file.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker must be able to create a malicious URL containing the XSS payload.
- **Victim must be logged in as admin:** For exploitation, the victim user needs to be logged into the admin panel.
