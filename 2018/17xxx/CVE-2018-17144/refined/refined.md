  "cveId": "CVE-2018-17144",
  "description": "A denial-of-service vulnerability exploitable by miners has been discovered in Bitcoin Core versions 0.14.0 up to 0.16.2. It is recommended to upgrade any of the vulnerable versions to 0.16.3 as soon as possible.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability stems from an optimization in Bitcoin Core 0.14 that skips a check for double-spent inputs within a single transaction in a block. This, combined with a change in UTXO tracking logic introduced in 0.15, allows an attacker (specifically a miner) to create an invalid block with a transaction that double spends an output, resulting in a node crash or, in later versions, an inflation of the Bitcoin supply.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing duplicate input check during block validation (Bitcoin Core 0.14.x)",
        "Insufficient error handling in UTXO updating logic (Bitcoin Core 0.14.x)",
      "UTXO tracking logic allows double spending under specific conditions (Bitcoin Core 0.15.0 - 0.16.2)"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (node crash) and inflation of Bitcoin supply. The denial of service is triggered by an assertion failure that causes the node to crash. The inflation occurs if the output being double spent was created in a previous block, leading to the creation of coins not backed by previous outputs.",
     "attackVectors": [
      "A miner constructs an invalid block containing a transaction with a double-spent input.",
      "The miner then broadcasts the invalid block to the network."
        ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker must be a miner, as only miners can create blocks with arbitrary transactions. The attacker needs to have an unspent transaction output to perform the attack.",
    "attackerPosition": "The attacker must be a miner participating in the Bitcoin network."
  },
  "affectedSystems": [
    "Bitcoin Core versions 0.14.0 up to 0.16.2",
    "Any forks of Bitcoin Core that include commit `eecffe50efc3944d713c701fa375dacbf17fb7cf`"
      ],
  "additionalNotes": [
    "The vulnerability was initially reported as a denial-of-service bug, but was later discovered to also enable inflation.",
    "The vulnerability is triggered by an attempt to double-spend an output within a single transaction in a block.",
        "The vulnerability was fixed in Bitcoin Core versions 0.16.3 and 0.17.0rc4",
        "The UTXO database change in 0.15 modified how spent outputs were handled, changing the nature of the bug from a crash to inflation"
