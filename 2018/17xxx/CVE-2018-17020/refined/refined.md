{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The ASUS GT-AC5300 router's firmware is susceptible to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack when a simple HTTP GET request is sent to the router's web server via telnet.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is caused by an unhandled exception or resource exhaustion in the web server when processing basic HTTP requests, leading to a denial of service.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation results in the web interface of the router becoming inaccessible. This effectively prevents users from configuring or managing the router, and possibly disrupts network connectivity.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is sending an HTTP GET request to the router's web server, which can be done via telnet.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to establish a TCP connection to the router's port 80. This could be achieved from within the local network or, if the port is exposed, from the internet."
