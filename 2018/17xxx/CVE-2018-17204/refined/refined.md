{
  "CVE-2018-17204": {
    "root_cause": "The OpenFlow 1.5 decoder in Open vSwitch does not properly validate group type and command information when decoding a group modification, leading to an assertion failure.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Assertion failure"
    ],
    "impact": "A specially crafted group update can cause an assertion failure, leading to a denial of service condition.",
    "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker can send a crafted OpenFlow 1.5 group update message to trigger the assertion failure.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send specially crafted OpenFlow messages to the Open vSwitch instance, requiring network access and potentially some level of control over the OpenFlow controller."
