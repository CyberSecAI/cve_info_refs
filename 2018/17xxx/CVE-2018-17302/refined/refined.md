The provided content describes a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in EspoCRM version 5.3.6.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when storing email drafts, allowing malicious JavaScript code to be injected and later executed in the context of other users.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into an email draft. When another user views this draft, the malicious JavaScript will be executed in their browser. This could allow the attacker to:
* Steal sensitive information (e.g., session cookies, user data).
* Perform actions on behalf of the victim user (e.g., modify data, send emails).
* Redirect the user to a malicious website.

**Attack vectors:** The attacker can insert malicious JavaScript code into the "mailbox" functionality when composing an email, specifically when using a link. By saving the email as a draft, the malicious script is then stored on the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have an account with the ability to compose an email and save it as a draft in the vulnerable EspoCRM application.
