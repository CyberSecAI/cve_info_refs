Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the Joomla! component "Penny Auction Factory" version 2.0.4.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. Specifically, the `filter_order_Dir` and `filter_order` parameters are vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code. This allows the attacker to:
    *   Read sensitive data from the database.
    *   Modify or delete data.
    *   Potentially gain control of the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable component.
*   **Vulnerable Parameters:** The `filter_order_Dir` and `filter_order` parameters in the URL are used to inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla! website.
*   No authentication is mentioned as being required, indicating the vulnerability might be exploitable by unauthenticated users.

**Technical Details:**

The exploit-db entry provides a proof-of-concept (POC) URL:

```
http://localhost/[PATH]/index.php?option=com_pennyfactory&task=showSearchResults&filter_order_Dir[SQL]&filter_order=[SQL]
```

The `[SQL]` portion in the URL is where the malicious SQL injection payload is placed. The example payload provided is:

```
%2c%45%58%54%52%41%43%54%56%41%4c%55%45%28%36%36%2c%43%4f%4e%43%41%54%28%30%78%35%63%2c%28%53%45%4c%45%43%54%20%28%45%4c%54%28%36%36%3d%36%36%2c%31%29%29%29%2c%43%4f%4e%43%41%54%5f%57%53%28%30%78%32%30%33%61%32%30%2c%55%53%45%52%28%29%2c%44%41%54%41%42%41%53%45%28%29%2c%56%45%52%53%49%4f%4e%28%29%29%29%29
```

This payload, when URL decoded, attempts to extract values using SQL functions including `USER()`, `DATABASE()`, and `VERSION()`, to demonstrate the SQL injection vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerable component is "Penny Auction Factory" version 2.0.4.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Ihsan Sencan.
*   The component is unpublished on the Joomla! Extensions Directory due to "Broken Links".
