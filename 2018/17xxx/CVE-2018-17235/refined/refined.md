Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-17235:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap overflow in the `mp4v2::impl::MP4Track::FinishSdtp()` function within the `mp4track.cpp` file of the libmp4v2 library.
*   The issue arises due to mishandling of the `compatibleBrand` field when processing a crafted MP4 file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Heap-based buffer overflow

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Denial of service (DoS). The heap overflow leads to a crash when processing a crafted MP4 file.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Crafted MP4 file: The vulnerability is triggered when a specially crafted MP4 file is processed by the vulnerable software.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to provide a malicious MP4 file to an application using the vulnerable `libmp4v2` library.
*   No special privileges are needed to trigger the crash

**Additional details:**
*   The bug report includes the ASAN output showing the heap-buffer-overflow at the specific location in the source code `src/mp4track.cpp:601`.
*   The ASAN output includes the call stack leading to the crash, which starts from the `mp4v2::impl::MP4Track::FinishSdtp()` function and goes through multiple functions to a main function.
*   The vulnerable code is in `libmp4v2` version 2.1.0.
*   A reproducer file has been provided, allowing for verification of the issue.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in the 2.1.0 release of `libmp4v2`
