2](show_bug.cgi?id=1629451#c2)  Sergio Basto    2018-09-21 05:55:41 UTC  ``` Hi,   Well I don't know how we are going to fix this , I don't see any patch , I keep  one copy of latest sources in github [1] but I don't see anyone fix it , for example Debian [2] .    [1] <https://github.com/sergiomb2/libmp4v2>  [2] <https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/mp4v2>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1629451#c3)  Ben Cotton    2019-10-31 20:41:34 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 29 is nearing its end of life. Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 29 on 2019-11-26. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora 'version' of '29'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora 29 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora  version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1629451#c4)  Ben Cotton    2019-11-27 19:29:21 UTC  ``` Fedora 29 changed to end-of-life (EOL) status on 2019-11-26. Fedora 29 is no longer maintained, which means that it will not receive any further security or bug fix updates. As a result we are closing this bug.  If you can reproduce this bug against a currently maintained version of Fedora please feel free to reopen this bug against that version. If you are unable to reopen this bug, please file a new report against the current release. If you experience problems, please add a comment to this bug.  Thank you for reporting this bug and we are sorry it could not be fixed.   ``` |  |

[v2.1.0](/enzo1982/mp4v2/tree/v2.1.0)

[`4b8649f`](/enzo1982/mp4v2/commit/4b8649f491390ed86296769724facd1253c4ad4e)

This is the MP4v2 v2.1.0 release, the first release by the new MP4v2 library project.

Changes since the MP4v2 v2.0.0 release:

#### 1. API changes

* Added public API functions `MP4ReadCallbacks`, `MP4CreateCallbacks[Ex]` and `MP4ModifyCallbacks[Ex]` to allow working with custom I/O routines and memory buffers.
* Added public API function `MP4FreeH264SeqPictHeaders` to free memory allocated by `MP4GetTrackH264SeqPictHeaders`.

#### 2. General improvements

* I/O system

  + Switched to ANSI C file I/O on Windows for improved performance with large files.
  + Handle extended paths (prefixed with `\\?\` or `\\?\UNC\`) on Windows.
* MP4Modify behavior

  + Attempt to truncate files if when modify reduces their size instead of filling space with a `free` atom.
  + Attempt to keep `moov` atom at the start of the file if it does not increase in size.
  + Do not leave empty `mdat` atoms behind after modify.

#### 3. Tools improvements

* Write total length and additonal metadata to `.chapters.txt` files when exporting chapters with `mp4chaps`.
* Added options for modifying sort tags (`sortartist`, `sortname` etc.) to `mp4tags`.

#### 4. Documentation improvements

* Converted old API documentation man pages to Doxygen comments in the public header files.

#### 5. Build system improvements

* Updated the Autotools build system

  + Fixed building as a shared library on Windows.
  + Added support for `pkg-config`.
* Added support for building with CMake.
* Upgraded Visual Studio solution and projects for Visual Studio 2022.
* Added Xcode project files.

#### 6. Bug fixes

* Fixed issues handling files with sample times exceeding 2^32.
* Fixed compile errors and warnings with newer versions of GCC/Clang.

#### 7. Vulnerability fixes

* <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-14054>
