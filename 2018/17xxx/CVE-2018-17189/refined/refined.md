Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the relevant information for CVE-2018-17189:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A denial-of-service vulnerability in `mod_http2` of Apache HTTP Server, triggered by sending request bodies in a "slow loris" way to plain resources. This causes the h2 stream for the request to occupy a server thread unnecessarily while cleaning up the incoming data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The primary vulnerability is a DoS, where a malicious client can exhaust server resources by sending specially crafted requests.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Resource exhaustion:** By sending malformed requests, the HTTP/2 stream occupies a server thread, leading to thread starvation, making the server unresponsive and resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Network:** Attackers send malformed HTTP/2 requests to the server.
*   **Exploitable over network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Network Access:** Ability to send network requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability affects Apache HTTP Server versions *2.4.37 and prior*.
*   The issue is specific to the `mod_http2` module and affects *HTTP/2 connections only*.
*   A "slow loris" type attack is mentioned, meaning the attacker sends partial or slow data to hold resources.
*   Several documents mention that `ExtendedStatus Off` directive when using mod\_systemd causes `systemctl` to hang, though this does not appear directly related to the core vulnerability for this CVE but is mentioned as a related bug within the patch.
*   Patches were released in various distributions, such as Debian, Ubuntu and Red Hat.
*   Some reports suggest that a possible mitigation is to disable HTTP/2 (`h2`) protocol.
