- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application's login page (`publiccms/admin/login.html`) has different response lengths for incorrect and correct usernames. This allows an attacker to identify valid usernames through brute-force attacks. After identifying a valid username, the same technique can be used to guess the corresponding password.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Brute-force vulnerability due to the lack of proper rate limiting or account lockout mechanisms.
    - Information disclosure via response length differences that distinguishes successful from unsuccessful login attempts.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - An attacker can successfully obtain valid usernames and passwords, allowing them to gain unauthorized access to the admin panel of the PublicCMS system.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attack vector is the login page accessible through the web interface (`publiccms/admin/login.html`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable login page.
    - No specific user privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.
