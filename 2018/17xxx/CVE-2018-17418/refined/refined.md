The provided content relates to CVE-2018-17418.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient file extension validation in the file upload functionality of Monstra CMS 3.0.4. The application uses a blacklist approach to filter disallowed file extensions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Blacklist-based filtering: The application uses a blacklist to prevent the upload of certain file types. This is inherently weak as it is easy to bypass by simply using a variation of a forbidden file extension.
- Case-insensitive check: The blacklist is case-sensitive allowing an attacker to bypass the filter by changing the case of the characters within an extension (e.g. .PhP instead of .php).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- Webshell Access: The attacker can establish a webshell, gaining persistent control of the server

**Attack vectors:**
- File Upload: The vulnerability can be exploited by uploading a malicious file via the file upload functionality in the `Files` section within the Content column.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to the administrative panel with file upload privileges.
- Ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests (e.g., using Burp Suite).
