{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Qt libraries used by the NoMachine client improperly load the `wintab32.dll` dynamic library, leading to a DLL hijacking vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "DLL Hijacking"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution on the client machine.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious `wintab32.dll` file placed in the same directory as a NoMachine `.nxs` file. Opening the `.nxs` file will cause the malicious DLL to be loaded instead of the legitimate one."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious `wintab32.dll` and make it accessible to the victim (e.g., via a network share). The victim needs to open a specially crafted .nxs file from the same location as the malicious DLL."
  },
  "affected_versions": "NoMachine versions prior to 5.3.27 are vulnerable. This includes the client part of all NoMachine installations on Windows (NoMachine free, NoMachine Enterprise Client, NoMachine Enterprise Desktop, and NoMachine Cloud Server).",
  "fix_versions": "Version 5.3.27 and later fix the issue.",
