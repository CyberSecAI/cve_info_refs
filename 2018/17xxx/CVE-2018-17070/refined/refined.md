The provided content describes two CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) vulnerabilities in UNL-CMS, which is related to CVE-2018-17070.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSRF vulnerability in content creation: An attacker can create new content (articles) by submitting a crafted POST request to the `/test/?q=node%2Fadd%2Farticle&render=overlay&render=overlay` endpoint.
- CSRF vulnerability in website settings: An attacker can modify website settings by submitting a crafted POST request to the `/test/?q=admin%2Fconfig%2Fsystem%2Fsite-information&render=overlay&render=overlay` endpoint.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Content creation: An attacker could create arbitrary content on the website.
- Website settings modification: An attacker could alter various website settings, potentially causing disruption or defacement, and possibly leading to further attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker uses a malicious webpage (HTML file) to trigger the forged requests. The provided HTML files contain JavaScript to submit the crafted POST requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to lure a logged-in user to visit the malicious webpage.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the target system's endpoints and required parameters for content creation and settings modification.
- The attacker needs to be able to host or deliver a malicious HTML page to the target user.
- The attacker needs to know the target server IP, which is exposed in the proof-of-concept code as `http:\/\/192.168.98.70\/test\/`.
