Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `DiscussionEntity` in GitLab's codebase, specifically the way it exposes the `resolved_by` attribute. Instead of using `NoteUserEntity` to limit the exposed user attributes, it directly exposes the full `User` record, leading to the leakage of sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Information Exposure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive user attributes via the `/discussions.json` endpoint, including:
    *   Encrypted OTP secrets (encrypted_otp_secret, encrypted_otp_secret_iv, encrypted_otp_secret_salt) along with their related encryption keys.
    *  Hashed OTP backup codes.
    *   Unencrypted `incoming_email_token`.
    *   Unencrypted `feed_token`.
*   **Inadequate Serialization:** The `DiscussionEntity` does not properly serialize the `User` object, failing to restrict the exposed attributes using `NoteUserEntity` which is used in similar contexts to prevent this type of leakage.
*   **Bypass of Security Mechanisms:** The `BlocksJsonSerialization` concern implemented to prevent this scenario for `User` model is bypassed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Account Takeover:** The `incoming_email_token` could potentially be used to create issues and comments as the compromised user, allowing an attacker to perform actions under their identity.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The `feed_token` could be used to access RSS feeds containing potentially sensitive information associated with the user.
*   **Two-Factor Authentication Bypass:** While the OTP secrets are encrypted, the disclosure of the secrets, along with salts and initialization vectors,  and especially the backup codes, may enable an attacker to bypass 2FA in some scenarios if the attacker is able to crack the encryption or use the provided backup codes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a request to the `/discussions.json` endpoint of a merge request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** An attacker must be an authenticated user to create a merge request, start a discussion, resolve it, and access the `/discussions.json` endpoint.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced in commit `3e66795ef1ff1228906239763910b051d8afcc37` and affects GitLab versions 11.1.0 and later.
* The identified tokens are unencrypted and should be treated as high risk.
