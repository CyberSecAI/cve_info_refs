The provided content is related to CVE-2018-17132.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation in `admin/goods_save.php` and `admin/goods_update.php` of phpmywind 5.5. Specifically, user-controlled input is directly inserted into the database via `goods_save.php` and later processed by the `String2Array` function in `goods_update.php`, leading to code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** Although not directly stated, the injection occurs when the malicious payload is inserted into the database.
- **Code Injection/Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The injected payload allows execution of arbitrary PHP code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain remote code execution, potentially leading to a full compromise of the server.
- Attackers can obtain a webshell.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack requires a logged-in administrative user.
- The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing PHP code to `admin/goods_save.php` via the `attrvalue[]` parameter.
- Then access `admin/goods_update.php?id=2`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrative access to the phpmywind application.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application.
- The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URLs: `admin/goods_save.php` and `admin/goods_update.php`.
