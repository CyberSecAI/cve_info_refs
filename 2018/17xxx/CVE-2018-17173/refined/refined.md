Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The LG SuperSign EZ CMS software has an improper parameter handling in the `getThumbnail` function. Specifically, the `sourceUri` parameter is vulnerable to command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The application uses the `sourceUri` parameter in a way that allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands. This is because the application is not properly sanitizing or validating user-provided input before passing it to the underlying system.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user input, allowing special characters such as `;` to be used to chain commands.
*   **Insecure Parameter Handling:** The application's use of the `sourceUri` parameter makes it vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the target system, effectively gaining full control of the device.
*   **System Compromise:** This can lead to data breaches, malware installation, and denial of service, among other malicious activities.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to access system resources, data, and functionalities that they are not authorized to access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is carried out via a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `/qsr_server/device/getThumbnail` endpoint.
*   **Modified `sourceUri` Parameter:** The attacker injects malicious commands within the `sourceUri` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable LG SuperSign device.
*   **Knowledge of the Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint `/qsr_server/device/getThumbnail`.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft an HTTP GET request.
*   **Basic Shell Command Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know how to construct shell commands, specifically using `rm`, `mkfifo`, `cat`, `sh`, and `nc`.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.
*   **No Privilege Escalation Required:** The vulnerable application runs as root, so no privilege escalation is required.

**Additional Notes**

* The exploit leverages a netcat binary present on the system to establish a reverse shell to the attacker machine.
* The blog post provides a detailed walk through of how the author discovered the vulnerability, and how to construct the malicious payload to gain shell access.
* The metasploit module and the exploit-db entry provides additional technical details and ways to automate exploitation.
