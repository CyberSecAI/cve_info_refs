  "CVE-2018-17963": {
    "description": "A potential integer overflow issue was found in the QEMU emulator. It could occur when a packet with large packet size is accepted and processed. A user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process resulting in DoS.",
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the networking back-end while processing packets with a large size value.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Denial of service"
     ],
    "impact": "A user inside the guest could use this flaw to cause a denial of service of the QEMU process on the host.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network packets"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send large packets to the emulated network interface from within the guest."
