{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user input before using it in the translation process, allowing for the injection of malicious code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the input field that is processed for translation.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to input text into the translation plugin."
