## Description

[![@QiAnXinCodeSafe](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39950310?u=8c4ad8c2174ba78c0604614a6e2feced07521ce6&v=4&size=48)](/QiAnXinCodeSafe)[QiAnXinCodeSafe](https://github.com/QiAnXinCodeSafe)opened [on Sep 21, 2018](https://github.com/wuweiit/mushroom/issues/16#issue-362472399)

Hi all,

There are a SQL injection vulnerability found by Qihoo360 CodeSafe Team.

Details as bellow:

The getChannel method in the ChannelService. java file is used directly to hash and run SQL statements without filtering parameters, resulting in SQL injection。

[![default](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39950310/45863532-21dc2b80-bda9-11e8-9921-cc127a7dd955.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39950310/45863532-21dc2b80-bda9-11e8-9921-cc127a7dd955.png)

Continuous tracing can be found that the getChannel method is invoked in WebApp.java.

View WebParam.get () method

When param is empty (that is the first time), a param will be constructed ， view the constructor.

You can see that all attributes in WebParam are obtained from request and are controlled by attackers.
