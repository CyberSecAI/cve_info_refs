The provided content is related to CVE-2018-17796.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a SQL injection caused by the `getChannel` method in `ChannelService.java` directly executing SQL statements without sanitizing user-controlled parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application directly incorporates user-provided input into SQL queries without any form of sanitization or parameterization.
- Lack of Input Validation:  The `WebParam` class, which populates parameters for the SQL query, takes all attributes directly from the request, making them fully attacker-controlled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary SQL Execution: An attacker can inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to:
  - Data exfiltration: Unauthorized access and retrieval of sensitive database information.
  - Data manipulation: Modification or deletion of database records.
  - Denial of Service: Disrupting the database operations, leading to application downtime.
  - Potential system compromise, depending on database permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP Request Manipulation: Attackers can craft malicious HTTP requests, injecting SQL code into the parameters that are passed to the `getChannel` method. Specifically, parameters passed through the request are used in the SQL query.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application.
- The attacker needs to be able to identify the vulnerable parameter, which is extracted from the request in the `WebParam` class.
