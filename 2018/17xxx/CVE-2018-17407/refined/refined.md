Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-17407:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in Tex Live's handling of certain files, specifically type1 font (.pfb) files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-  A buffer overflow exists in the `t1_check_unusual_charstring` function within the `writet1.c` file, which is used by `dvips`, `pdf(la)tex`, and `luatex`.
- The vulnerability arises when processing crafted type1 font files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves crafting a malicious type1 font (.pfb) file.
- The malicious font file needs to be loaded by a user running `pdf(la)tex`, `dvips`, or `luatex`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted malicious .pfb font file to the victim in a way that triggers the vulnerable code path when the user processes a document with texlive tools.
- The attacker does not necessarily need direct access to the system but needs to find a way to have the victim load the malicious font file using the vulnerable software.

**Additional details:**
- The fix involves changes to `texk/dvipsk/writet1.c`, `texk/web2c/luatexdir/font/writet1.w`, and `texk/web2c/pdftexdir/writet1.c` to prevent the buffer overflow.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Nick Roessler from the University of Pennsylvania.
- The issue affects multiple Tex Live binaries/utilities.
- Patches were applied to prevent overflow by using alloc_array to allocate the right size buffer and using strcpy to avoid writing past the buffer limit.
