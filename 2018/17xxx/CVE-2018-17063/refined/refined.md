The provided content relates to CVE-2018-17063.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `/goform/NTPSyncWithHost` handler of the D-Link DIR-816 A2 router firmware. All parameters passed to this handler are used in the construction of the `date -s %s` command without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Command injection vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper input sanitization. The router does not validate or sanitize the parameters before using them in the `date` command, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the shell.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the router. This could potentially lead to:
  - Full control of the router
  - Data exfiltration
  - Denial of service
  - Installation of malware
  - Network compromise

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted POST request to the `/goform/NTPSyncWithHost` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to have network connectivity to the router and the ability to send HTTP POST requests. They also need to retrieve the CSRF token (`tokenid`) from the router's login page.
