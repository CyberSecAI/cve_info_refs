- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies within the `svgGetNextPathField` function in `libsvg2`. The function does not properly advance the `szStart` pointer under certain conditions, leading to an infinite loop and a subsequent out-of-memory error due to repeated memory allocation within a "dead block".

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **Infinite loop:** The `while` loop that advances the `szStart` pointer can potentially become an infinite loop if none of the loop condition characters (`\t`, `\r`, `\n`, ` `, `,`) are found. This will lead to `szStart` always pointing to the same location.
    - **Memory exhaustion:** Inside the infinite loop, memory is allocated using `svgNewPathCommand`, which will lead to memory exhaustion. This is because the vulnerable code is called from a parsing context where the loop will infinitely allocate memory.
    - **Denial of service (DoS):** Due to the memory exhaustion, the application will likely crash, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Memory exhaustion leading to system collapse.
    - Denial of service.
    - The vulnerability can cause a crash in an application that is using the `libsvg2` library.

- **Attack vectors**:
    - The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted SVG file with path data that doesn't have any delimiters or whitespace characters within the path data.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - An attacker needs the ability to provide the vulnerable software with a malicious crafted SVG file.
    - No special privileges are needed.
