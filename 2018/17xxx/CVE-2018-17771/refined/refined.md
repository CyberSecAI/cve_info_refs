Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-17771:

**Summary:**
The provided content discusses vulnerabilities in payment terminals, particularly Ingenico devices, and it directly mentions CVE-2018-17771. This vulnerability relates to hardcoded FTP credentials within Ingenico Tellium 2 devices.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of hardcoded credentials for the FTP server within the Ingenico Tellium 2 payment terminals. These credentials are used when the terminal is in maintenance mode and accessed through a PPP connection over USB.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Hardcoded Credentials:** The primary vulnerability is the use of static, hardcoded credentials for the FTP server. This allows unauthorized access to the device's file system.
2.  **Insecure Protocol:** The custom protocol used for establishing the PPP connection is unencrypted (clear text), enabling interception of data in transit.
3.  **Lack of Authentication:** The FTP server uses the same static credentials, meaning that anyone who is aware of these credentials can access the FTP server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
1. **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the device's file system.
2. **Data Manipulation:** With FTP access, attackers can modify device configurations, upload malicious software or firmware, and potentially install backdoors.
3. **Compromise of Payment Data:** While the content doesn't directly state that payment data is accessible via FTP, the ability to modify the device opens opportunities for attackers to intercept or modify payment data processed by the terminal.
4. **Device Takeover:** Complete control of the device is possible with the ability to upload and execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **Physical Access:** Attackers can connect to the terminal via a USB connection.
2.  **Network Access (Indirect):** While the terminal doesn't directly listen for network connections, an attacker can potentially use a compromised workstation to initiate the LTT (maintenance) connection over the network using the hardcoded credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1. **Physical Access to the device:** The attacker needs physical access to the device or access to an intermediary machine connected to the device.
2. **Knowledge of Hardcoded Credentials:** The attacker must know the hardcoded username and password for the FTP server (ftp/ftp).
3.  **Ability to Initiate PPP Connection:** The attacker needs to be able to use the LTT software or emulate the connection and FTP commands.

**Additional Notes:**
- The content mentions that the vulnerability was disclosed to the vendor on 01.09.2018, and a fixed version was released on 01.03.2020.
- The vendor is Ingenico, and the vulnerable product is the Tellium 2 series.
- The vulnerability was discovered by researchers at Positive Technologies.
