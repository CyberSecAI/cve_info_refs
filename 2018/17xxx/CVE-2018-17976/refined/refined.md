- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Epic feature in GitLab leaks private project namespaces when a related issue from a private project is linked to an epic.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a result of insufficient access control checks when displaying the epic description, which exposes private project namespace information.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view the namespace of private projects by visiting the epic page where a related issue of the private project is linked.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker adds a related issue from a private project to an epic. Then any user who visits the epic page can see the leaked private namespace.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to create an epic, create a private project, create a confidential issue within the private project, and link the private issue to the epic. They don't need to be a member of the private project.
