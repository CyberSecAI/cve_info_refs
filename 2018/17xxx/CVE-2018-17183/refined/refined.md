Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2018-17183:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a user-writable error exception table in Ghostscript. This allowed an attacker to potentially overwrite or replace error handlers by supplying crafted PostScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **User-Writable Error Handler:** The primary weakness is that the error handler table, which dictates how errors are handled, could be modified by users.
*   **Insufficient Sandboxing:**  The `-dSAFER` sandbox mode was not sufficient to prevent the manipulation of the error handler.
*   **Redefining Error Handlers**: The code assumed that when an error was raised, execution would cease. Redefining the error handler allowed code execution to continue after an error.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers could inject malicious code by replacing error handlers, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Bypass of Sandbox Protection:** The vulnerability enabled attackers to bypass the intended security protections of the `-dSAFER` mode.
*   **Access to Arbitrary Files**: By injecting malicious code, it is possible to access arbitrary files.
*   **Denial of Service:** Maliciously redefined error handlers could cause denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted PostScript Files:** The primary attack vector involves tricking a user or automated system into processing a specially crafted PostScript file.
*   **Redefinition of Error Handlers:** The attacker redefines the error handlers to continue program execution after an error, which may lead to code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to supply PostScript files**: The attacker needs to be able to get a vulnerable system to process the crafted PostScript files.
*   **Understanding of PostScript:** Knowledge of the PostScript language is needed to craft the malicious files.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue was initially reported by Tavis Ormandy from Google Project Zero.
*   The fix involved locking the error handling to prevent it from being overwritten in `-dSAFER` mode by copying default handlers into the gserrordict dictionary which is made noaccess.
*   A new upstream release of Ghostscript addressed this issue along with other bugs.
