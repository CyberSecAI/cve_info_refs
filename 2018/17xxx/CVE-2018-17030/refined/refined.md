The content is related to CVE-2018-17030.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the `process.php` file within the BigTree-CMS. Specifically, the `call_user_func` function is used with a user-controlled value from `$bigtree["form"]["hooks"]["post"]`. This allows an attacker to manipulate the value of `$bigtree["form"]["hooks"]["post"]` to `preg_replace` and use the `\e` modifier, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the use of `call_user_func` with an attacker-controlled function name, allowing execution of any PHP function. The use of the `preg_replace` function with the `\e` modifier makes remote code execution possible.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to complete compromise of the system, data theft, or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by setting the `$bigtree["form"]["hooks"]["post"]` variable to `preg_replace` with the "\e" modifier and a malicious payload. This occurs when an admin user interacts with the crafted form.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have administrative access to the BigTree-CMS to manipulate the form hook settings and trigger the vulnerable code.
