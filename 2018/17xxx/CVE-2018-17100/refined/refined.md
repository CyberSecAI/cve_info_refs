Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-17100:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by an integer overflow in the `multiply_ms` function located in the `tools/ppm2tiff.c` file of the LibTIFF library.
*   The `multiply_ms` function calculates a size by multiplying two `tmsize_t` values.  If the result of the multiplication exceeds the maximum value representable by `tmsize_t`, an integer overflow occurs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The core weakness is the lack of proper bounds checking before the multiplication within the `multiply_ms` function. This allows an attacker to potentially control the size calculations.
*   **Heap Buffer Overflow (Indirect):** Although the immediate issue is an integer overflow, it leads to a heap buffer overflow in `ppm2tiff`. This is because the overflowed size value is later used to allocate memory, leading to a write outside of the intended bounds when the data is copied.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (Crash):**  The primary impact is a denial of service due to a crash. The integer overflow leads to an invalid memory access causing the application to terminate.
*   **Unspecified Other Impact:** It's mentioned that the vulnerability "possibly have unspecified other impact", suggesting there might be potential for further exploitation beyond a simple crash, although not explicitly stated.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Image File:** An attacker crafts a specially designed image file, specifically a PPM (Portable Pixmap) file, that when processed by `ppm2tiff` using vulnerable libtiff, triggers the integer overflow.
*   **File Processing:** The vulnerability is triggered when the vulnerable `ppm2tiff` tool or application that uses the libtiff library parses and processes the malicious PPM file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to provide the malicious input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the vulnerable application with a malicious PPM image file which causes the integer overflow. This could be through various means including a file upload, email, or tricking a user into processing a malicious file.
*   **No special privileges:** The attacker does not need to have any special privileges in order to exploit the vulnerability. The vulnerability can be triggered by a regular user who processes the malicious image.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue is present in LibTIFF version 4.0.9.
*   Patches were developed and committed to the libtiff git repository which include a check to prevent an integer overflow and subsequently a heap buffer overflow.
*   The vulnerability was addressed by Red Hat in RHSA-2019:2053 which included several fixes to libtiff.
*   The Debian LTS also addressed the issue in DLA 1557-1 for the Debian 8 "Jessie" release.
*   Ubuntu released USN-3864-1 which includes a fix for this vulnerability.
