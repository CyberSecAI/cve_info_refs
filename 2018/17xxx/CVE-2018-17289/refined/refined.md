Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-17289:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an XML External Entity (XXE) injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The Kofax Front Office Server Administration Console processes XML files without proper sanitization or disabling of external entities.
*   The application allows users to upload a package configuration file (.ZIP) containing XML files (specifically `Package.xml`).
*   The `Package.xml` is vulnerable to XXE injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.
*   The content of the targeted file is included in the HTTP response.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker crafts a malicious `Package.xml` file with an XML external entity definition.
*   The crafted XML payload is embedded within the `.ZIP` file.
*   The attacker uploads this malicious `.ZIP` file through the Kofax application's web interface, specifically to the `/Kofax/KFS/Admin/PackageService/package/upload` endpoint using the `file` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Kofax Front Office Server Administration Console.
*   The attacker must have the ability to upload package configuration files.
*   The attacker needs the ability to create and manipulate XML and ZIP files.

**Technical Details:**
*The attacker modifies the Package.xml file to include an external entity definition pointing to a file they wish to read (e.g. `/c:/windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts`):*
```xml
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<!DOCTYPE r [
<!ELEMENT r ANY >
<!ENTITY sp SYSTEM "file:///c:/windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts">
]>
<Package>
<Name><r>&sp;</r></Name>
<Description></Description>
</Package>
```
*This malicious `Package.xml` is included in the uploaded ZIP archive.*

*The application processes this XML file and includes the content of the specified file (`/c:/windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts`) within the "Name" field of the JSON response.*
