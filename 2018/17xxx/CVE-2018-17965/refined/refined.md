Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-17965:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A memory leak exists in the `WriteSGIImage` function located in `coders/sgi.c` of ImageMagick.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability is a memory leak. Specifically, in the `WriteSGIImage` function, there's a code path where allocated memory for `pixel_info` is not released when a memory allocation error occurs later in the function, specifically when `packet_info` allocation fails.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Repeatedly triggering this memory leak could eventually lead to resource exhaustion, causing a denial-of-service condition. An attacker could craft a specific SGI image that triggers this code path to cause memory exhaustion.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by providing a specially crafted SGI image file that triggers the vulnerable code path in `WriteSGIImage`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit a malicious SGI image to an application that uses ImageMagick to process images, thus triggering the `WriteSGIImage` function. No special privileges on the system are required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in ImageMagick version 7.0.7-28.
*   The issue was addressed in the upstream commit  [e92492afac23315358850e5e050144930049e9cb](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/commit/e92492afac23315358850e5e050144930049e9cb).
*   Red Hat states that versions of ImageMagick shipped with RHEL 5, 6 and 7 were not affected.
*   Ubuntu provided updates to fix the vulnerability.
