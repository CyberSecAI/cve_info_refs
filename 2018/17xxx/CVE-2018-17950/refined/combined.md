## 1.0 Whatâs New?

eDirectory 9.1 SP2 provides the following enhancements, and fixes in this release:

### 1.1 Enhancement

#### Enhanced Linux Installer

With this version of eDirectory, the Linux installer has been enhanced to include all the unchanged RPMs from eDirectory 9.1.1 along with those RPMs which have changes made for eDirectory 9.1.2. While upgrading eDirectory from 9.1.1 to 9.1.2, the former will not be upgraded or re-installed. Only the new/modified RPMs from 9.1.2 will be installed/upgraded on your server.

### 1.2 Operating System Support

In addition to the platforms supported in previous releases of eDirectory, this release adds support for the following operating system:

* SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) 15

  *NOTE:*To use the ndstrace and ldif2dib utilities on SLES 15, install the version 5 of ncurses from the SLES 15 repository.
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6.10

### 1.3 Fixed Issues

eDirectory 9.1 SP2 includes the following software fixes that resolve several previous issues:

#### Resolved Security Vulnerabilities

This release resolves the following security vulnerabilities:

* *CVE-2018-17952:*
  Cross site scripting vulnerability in eDirectory prior to 9.1 SP2.
* *CVE-2018-17950:*
  Incorrect enforcement of authorization checks in eDirectory prior to 9.1 SP2.

#### LDAP Bind Performance Is Degraded Compared to eDirectory 8.8.8

*Issue:*
LDAP bind performance is degraded due to checks to figure out if user password needs to be re-encrypted with a newly created AES256 tree key.

*Fix:*
With this release, automatic re-encryption of user password is removed. Password re-encryption can be done using the diagpwd utility which is bundled with this version of eDirectory. (Bug 1104045)

#### LDAP Search Results in High Utilization of eDirectory Server

*Issue:*
LDAP search results in high utilization of the eDirectory server while performing search operation with dereference alias. (Bug 1097995)

#### eDirectory Exhausts All Ephemeral Ports when Configured with Large Number of Dynamic Groups

*Issue:*
eDirectory exhausts all ephemeral ports when configured with large number of dynamic groups and a large number of dynamic members in each group.

*Fix:*
A new environment variable is introduced with this version of eDirectory. You must set the environment variable NDSD\_AGENT\_CONTEXT\_OPTIMIZATION to true to avoid this issue. (Bug 1075000)

#### eDirectory Installation Wizard Does Not Respond on Windows 2016 Server

*Issue:*
eDirectory installation wizard does not respond on Windows 2016 server after starting the install.dlm from the NDSCons.exe file.(Bug 1099424)

#### eDirectory Crashes While Logging In Using the Enhanced Smartcard Method

*Issue:*
eDirectory crashes during login if the license for the enhanced smartcard method has expired. (Bug 1095624)

#### eDirectory Crashes with the Older Version of SAML Method

*Issue:*
eDirectory crashes due to an invalid assertion is passed to the SAML method.

*Fix:*
Upgrade to the latest version of the SAML method. (Bug 999386)

### 1.4 Supported Upgrade Paths

To upgrade to eDirectory 9.1 SP2, you need to be on eDirectory 8.8.8.x or above. For more information on upgrading eDirectory, see the [NetIQ eDirectory Installation Guide](https://www.netiq.com/documentation/edirectory-91/edir_install/data/bookinfo.html).

## 2.0 Whatâs Deprecated?

The following feature is deprecated in this release:

* *Enhanced Nested Group:*
  We have deprecated support for Nested dynamic groups in 9.1.2 release. The usage of Nested dynamic groups is not a recommended solution due to the complexities of resolving member lists and the nature of dynamic groups. Nested static groups will continue to be supported.

## 3.0 What will be Deprecated?

The following feature will be deprecated in the upcoming eDirectory 9.2 release:

* *Auditing with XDAS:*
  We will be deprecating support for auditing with XDAS in 9.2. We recommend you to use CEF for auditing.
