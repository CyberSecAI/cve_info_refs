Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2018-17562:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The provided content explicitly mentions "CVE-2018-17562 â€“ FaxFinder 5.0.5.8 < SQLite Injection Vulnerability", confirming its relevance.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an **SQLite injection vulnerability** present in FaxFinder versions 5.0.5.8 and older.
*   The application fails to properly sanitize user input when constructing SQL queries, specifically within the `call_details` functionality.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The core vulnerability is an SQL injection, specifically targeting the SQLite database used by FaxFinder.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not properly sanitize the `oid` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users, meaning that no login credentials are required to exploit it.
*   **Information Leakage:** A valid OID is needed as an injection point, which can easily be enumerated by an attacker via scripting.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Schema Disclosure:** An attacker can gain access to the underlying database schema.
*   **Data Extraction:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database (potentially including usernames, passwords, and other data).
*   **Potential for Further Compromise:**  The extracted information can be used to further compromise the system or other systems connected to it.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request Tampering:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request targeting the `call_details` endpoint.
*   **OID Parameter Manipulation:** The `oid` parameter in the URL is manipulated to inject malicious SQL queries.
*   **Apostrophe Insertion:** The use of a single quote (`'`) in the OID parameter is used to break the SQL syntax which is then followed by SQL Injection techniques.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable FaxFinder instance.
*   **Basic SQL Knowledge:** Some understanding of SQL syntax is required to craft effective injection payloads.
*   **Ability to enumerate valid OIDs:** The attacker needs to be able to determine a valid OID to be able to use it as an injection point.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to the application to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating how to identify the vulnerability and extract the database schema.
*   The content also includes a timeline of reporting the vulnerability to MultiTech and the subsequent fix release in version 5.1.6
*  The attack vector has been concealed to prevent unauthorized exploitation.
*   The information provided is more detailed than the generic CVE description

In summary, CVE-2018-17562 is a significant security flaw due to the ease of exploitation, lack of authentication requirements, and the potential impact on the confidentiality and integrity of the FaxFinder system. The vulnerability allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to perform an SQL Injection by manipulating a valid OID.
