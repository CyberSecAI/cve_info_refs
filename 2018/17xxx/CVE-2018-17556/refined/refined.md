The provided content discusses a stored XSS vulnerability in MODX Revolution version 2.6.5-pl.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application does not sanitize user-supplied input in the 'Name' field when creating a new Media Source, allowing HTML tags and scripts to be stored in the database.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**:  When a user visits a page where the crafted media source name is displayed, the injected JavaScript payload executes within the user's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, cookie theft, or defacement of the website.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited through the "Media Sources -> Create New Media Source" functionality within the MODX Revolution application. Specifically, the "Name" field is vulnerable to XSS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have the ability to create or edit Media Sources within the MODX Revolution application, meaning they would need to be a logged in user with appropriate permissions.
