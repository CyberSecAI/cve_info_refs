Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The `feedback_admin.class.php` in MetInfo version 6.1.0 does not properly sanitize user input in the `class1` parameter when exporting feedback data. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper input sanitization or validation for the `class1` parameter before it is used in an SQL query.
*   **Direct SQL Query Construction:**  The application constructs SQL queries by directly concatenating user-controlled data, which is a classic vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, including administrator usernames and password hashes.
*   **Remote Code Execution (Potentially):** The attacker mentions the ability to use SQL injection to "write a webshell." While not directly demonstrated, this is a known risk with SQL injection, especially when combined with specific database server configurations and write permissions.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially modify or delete data in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Parameter Manipulation:** The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTTP request using the `class1` GET parameter.
*   **Direct Access to Admin Panel:** The attacker needs access to the admin panel and an active admin session to initiate the request to `admin/index.php?n=feedback&c=feedback_admin&a=doexport`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:**  The attacker requires network access to the MetInfo application.
*   **Admin Access:** An attacker needs to be logged into the MetInfo administration panel, though in some cases they could exploit this vulnerability with a less privileged account if the admin application did not validate permissions correctly.
*   **Knowledge of MetInfo:**  The attacker needs to understand the MetInfo file structure and vulnerability point.

**Specific Example (POC):**

The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability by injecting the following SQL query within the `class1` parameter:

```
-1/**/union/**/select/**/concat(admin_id,0x7e,admin_pass)/**/from/**/met_admin_table
```

This SQL injection extracts the `admin_id` and `admin_pass` from the `met_admin_table` database table.
