## Description

[![@brainrecursion](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16461841?v=4&size=48)](/brainrecursion)[brainrecursion](https://github.com/brainrecursion)opened [on Sep 19, 2018](https://github.com/docmarionum1/slack-archive-bot/issues/12#issue-361897120)

1. SQL injection - [CVE-2018-17232](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3xg5-3w6j-4vf8 "CVE-2018-17232")

   When searching the archive user input is used directly to create an SQL query. This can be exploited to view all messages, including messages from private channels the user is not a member of. Potentially exploitable to gain Remote Code Execution (RCE) depending on the configuration of the server.
2. Information disclosure.

   If a user searches for a phrase that has been posted in a private channel the user is not a member of, the bot returns nothing rather than "No results found". This leaks to the user that the phrase has been said.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
