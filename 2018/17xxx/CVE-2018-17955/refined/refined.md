{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The yast2-multipath module uses a static filename `/tmp/.yast2-multipath-builtin-conf` for a temporary file, instead of a random filename or a directory like `.local.tmpdir`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of a static filename for temporary files",
      "Potential for arbitrary file overwrite"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially overwrite arbitrary files by creating a symbolic link or file with the same name as the temporary file used by `yast2-multipath`, potentially leading to system compromise or data corruption.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to the system is required to exploit this vulnerability.",
      "The attacker must be able to create files or symlinks within the `/tmp/` directory.",
       "The attacker must have the knowledge of when/how the vulnerable file is generated"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs local access to the system and the ability to create files or symlinks in the `/tmp/` directory."
