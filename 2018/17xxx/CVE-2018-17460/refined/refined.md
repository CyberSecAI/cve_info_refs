  "vulnerability_details": {
    "CVE-2018-17460": {
      "root_cause": "The username:password part of a URL was not properly removed in the Omnibox (address bar)",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Information Leak"
      ],
      "impact": "Sensitive information (username and password) in the URL could be visible to the user in the address bar.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "The attacker needs to trick the user into visiting a URL that contains a username and password. The user then could potentially expose their credentials to onlookers via screen sharing or screen recording.",
        "The attacker does not have access to the credentials since the user must still enter them into a website or be redirected to a website."
       ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to construct a URL that contains a username and password and trick the user into visiting it.",
      "additional_details": "This vulnerability is related to how Chrome handles URLs containing authentication information in the address bar. While the user must still enter the credentials or be redirected to a website that requires them, the URL itself will contain the username and password, which will not be elided (removed from view) from the user in the address bar."
