{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application allows users to upload arbitrary files, but does not properly validate file extensions, allowing a malicious user to upload PHP code disguised as a JPG file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Unrestricted file upload",
    "Inadequate file extension validation",
    "Remote Code Execution"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker uploads a malicious PHP file (disguised as a JPG). By intercepting the request using a proxy, the attacker changes the filename extension from .jpg to .php. When accessed, the PHP code is executed by the web server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs a low-privilege account on the UltimatePOS portal and the ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests. They need to be able to browse the products page and edit existing or add new products."
