    "description": "A vulnerability in uploader.swf, io.swf and flashcanvas.swf in SugarCRM Community Edition 6.5.26 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack on a targeted system. SugarCRM Community Edition 6.5 had reached its end-of-life and is no longer supported. 6.5.26 is the last version and no patches will be provided by the vendor.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists in the way the application handles user-supplied input within the uploader.swf, io.swf, and flashcanvas.swf files.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they visit a page containing a vulnerable SWF file. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is remote. An unauthenticated attacker crafts malicious URLs with payloads within the parameters of the vulnerable .swf files.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious URLs containing a JavaScript payload and induce a user to visit a page that uses the vulnerable SWF files."
