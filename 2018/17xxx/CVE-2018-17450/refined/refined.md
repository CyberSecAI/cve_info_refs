The provided content is related to CVE-2018-17450.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The GitLab Kubernetes integration was vulnerable to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) issue.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SSRF vulnerability: The GitLab Kubernetes integration allowed access to any URL accessible from the GitLab server.
- Insufficient input validation

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with access to the GitLab instance could access internal resources.
- On GCP, an attacker could potentially determine the GCP service token for the GitLab host.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker with access to use the GitLab instance could trigger the SSRF by making requests to arbitrary URLs through the Kubernetes integration.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to have an account on the GitLab instance to exploit this vulnerability.
