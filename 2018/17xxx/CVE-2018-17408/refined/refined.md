  "CVE-2018-17408": {
    "description": "Zahir Enterprise Plus 6 build 10b is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow. The vulnerability is triggered when opening a CSV file containing CR/LF characters and overly long strings via the 'Import from other File' functionality, leading to the overwriting of a structured exception handler (SEH) record.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The application fails to properly handle Carriage Return Line Feed (CRLF) characters and large inputs when parsing a CSV file, leading to a buffer overflow.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation",
         "Stack-based buffer overflow",
        "Uncontrolled resource consumption"
      ],
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Importing a specially crafted CSV file containing long strings and CRLF characters"
        ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have local access to the system where the vulnerable software is installed to import the crafted CSV file. No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability.",
       "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to overwrite the SEH record, take control of the program execution flow, and execute arbitrary code on the victimâ€™s machine. This could lead to complete system compromise, privilege escalation, and/or data theft."
