{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `onlyOwner` modifier in the Coinlancer smart contract had an incorrect comparison, which allowed any user to bypass the access control restriction. The modifier intended to restrict function execution to the contract owner but instead used `!=` (not equal to) instead of `==` (equal to) in the `require` statement.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect access control logic.",
      "Misuse of the `onlyOwner` modifier.",
        "Use of != where == should have been used",
      "Lack of proper auditing of smart contract code."
    ],
    "impact": "Theoretically, if the `onlyOwner` modifier was used with this logic, any user could execute functions intended to be restricted to the contract owner, leading to potential unauthorized changes. The provided text states that this particular bug was not exploitable as this modifier was not actually used.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Direct interaction with the smart contract functions using the vulnerable modifier."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": [
      "Any user capable of sending transactions to the smart contract."
