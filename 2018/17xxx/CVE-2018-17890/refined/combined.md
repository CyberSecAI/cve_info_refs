### 4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

**4.2.1   [USE OF INSUFFICIENTLY RANDOM VALUES CWE-330](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/330.html)**

The application uses a session identification mechanism that could allow attackers to obtain the active session ID, which could allow arbitrary remote code execution.

[CVE-2018-17888](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-17888) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

**4.2.2    [USE OF OBSOLETE FUNCTION CWE-477](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/477.html)**

The application uses insecure and outdated software components for functionality, which could allow arbitrary code execution.

[CVE-2018-17890](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-17890) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

**4.2.3    [INCORRECT PERMISSION ASSIGNMENT FOR CRITICAL RESOURCE CWE-732](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/732.html)**

The application implements a method of user account control that causes standard account security features to not be utilized as intended, which could allow user account compromise and may allow for remote code execution.

[CVE-2018-17892](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-17892) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

**4.2.4    [USE OF HARD-CODED CREDENTIALS CWE-798](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html)**

The application creates default accounts that have hard-coded passwords, which could allow an attacker to gain privileged access.

[CVE-2018-17894](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-17894) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

**--------- Begin Update A Part 3 of 3 --------**

**4.2.5    [IMPROPER LIMITATION OF A PATHNAME TO A RESTRICTED DIRECTORY ('PATH TRAVERSAL') CWE-22](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)**

The application allows external input to construct a pathname that is able to be resolved outside the intended directory. This could allow an attacker to impersonate a legitimate user, obtain restricted information, or execute arbitrary code.

[CVE-2018-17934](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-17934) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)).

**4.2.6    [UNRESTRICTED UPLOAD OF FILE WITH DANGEROUS TYPE CWE-434](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/434.html)**

The application allows the upload of arbitrary files that can modify or overwrite configuration files to the server, which could allow remote code execution.

[CVE-2018-17936](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-17936) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)).

The web server application allows injection of arbitrary SQL characters, which can be used to inject SQL into an executing statement and allow arbitrary code execution.

[CVE-2018-18982](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-18982) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)).

## 5. MITIGATIONS

NUUO has developed a fix for the reported vulnerabilities and recommends users update to firmware v3.3 or the latest available. The update can be located at the following location:

<http://d1.nuuo.com/NUUO/CMS/v3.3.0/CMS_NUUO_All_v3.3.0.18.zip>

NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS-CERT website](/ics/) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
