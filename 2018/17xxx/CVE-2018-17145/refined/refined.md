{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Uncontrolled memory resource consumption due to unbounded growth of inventory tracking maps.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Lack of limits on the size of inventory tracking maps.",
    "Inadequate eviction mechanism in the MRU map implementation.",
    "Unbounded maps for tracking requested transactions and blocks."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks due to out-of-memory (OOM) conditions, potentially leading to node crashes or system freezes. Could also affect related services such as Lightning Network.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a high volume of inv messages containing random or non-existent transaction hashes to a vulnerable node via the peer-to-peer network.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Any peer connected to a vulnerable node can initiate the attack. No special privileges or positions are required, only a connection to a vulnerable peer."
