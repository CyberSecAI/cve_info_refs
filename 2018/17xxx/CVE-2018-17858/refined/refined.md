Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-17858:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection within the `com_installer` component of Joomla.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The core weakness is a lack of proper CSRF token validation for actions performed within the `com_installer` component's backend. This makes it possible for an attacker to trick a logged-in administrator into performing unwanted actions on the Joomla site.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful CSRF attack could allow an attacker to perform actions as the logged-in administrator. This could include installing malicious extensions, modifying site configurations, or otherwise compromising the Joomla site.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a CSRF attack. This would typically involve crafting a malicious link or HTML form that, when clicked or submitted by a logged-in administrator, would execute unwanted actions on the Joomla site through the vulnerable `com_installer`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to lure or trick a logged-in Joomla administrator into visiting a malicious page or link. The administrator must have backend access and be logged in to the Joomla site at the time of the attack.
