- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by an error message that reveals technical information when the Carestream server is contacted and no Oracle TNS listener is available.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information Exposure Through an Error Message (CWE-209). The system leaks technical details through a HTTP 500 error when it cannot connect to an Oracle TNS listener.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can use the leaked technical information to initiate a more elaborate attack. The direct impact is information disclosure, which is rated as low in the CVSS score.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). An attacker needs network access to the affected system to passively read traffic and trigger the error.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable system but does not need any specific privileges (PR:N) or user interaction (UI:N). The attack complexity is rated as high (AC:H).
