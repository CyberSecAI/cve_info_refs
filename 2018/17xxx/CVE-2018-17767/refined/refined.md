Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-17767:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of hardcoded credentials for the PPP connection in Ingenico Tellium 2 payment terminals. This PPP connection is established over a virtual USB serial interface for maintenance purposes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The PPP connection uses static, hardcoded credentials, making it easily exploitable.
*   **Cleartext Protocol:** The custom protocol used for communication is not encrypted, exposing the credentials during the PPP handshake.
*   **Insecure FTP Server:**  The FTP server launched by the pinpad uses hardcoded credentials as well ("ftp"/"ftp"), and is used for updates and configurations.
*   **Lack of Encryption**: The communication between the maintenance software and the pinpad is not encrypted, allowing anyone with a USB sniffer to see credentials and commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the payment terminal by exploiting the hardcoded PPP credentials.
*   **Malicious Updates:** An attacker could use the FTP server to upload malicious updates, potentially leading to complete control of the device.
*   **Data Theft:** Attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive data by gaining unauthorized access to the terminal or intercepting communications.
*   **Code Execution:** With the ability to upload code, attackers can execute arbitrary code on the terminal.
*   **Complete Device Compromise**: With the ability to execute code and control the device, attackers can compromise the device.
*   **Financial Loss:**  Compromised payment terminals can be used for fraudulent transactions or skimming card data, causing financial losses for both merchants and customers.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical Access:** The attack vector is physical access to the terminal's USB port, or network access to the pinpad that exposes the FTP service.
*   **USB Sniffing:** Attackers can use a USB sniffer to intercept the PPP connection setup and retrieve the hardcoded credentials, without needing to reverse engineer the device.
*   **Network access**: An attacker with network access can potentially connect to the FTP server if it's exposed through an improperly configured network interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Proximity:** The attacker needs physical access to the Ingenico Tellium 2 payment terminal to connect via USB or network access to the device.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** Some technical knowledge is required to capture the USB or network traffic, identify the credentials, and use them to establish the PPP connection.
*   **Software Tools**: The attacker would need basic software tools to sniff USB or network traffic.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vendor released a fixed version and details about the vulnerability on 01.03.2020.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by the Positive Research Center (Positive Technologies Company)
*   The provided content gives more context and detail than the official CVE description. It explains not just the existence of the hardcoded credentials, but how they are used and the specific technologies involved.
*   The video content also includes information about anti-tampering measures and other common vulnerabilities, as well as a general methodology for analyzing POS terminal hardware and software. These are not directly related to CVE-2018-17767, but are very useful in understanding the general context.
