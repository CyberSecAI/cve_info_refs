The provided content relates to CVE-2018-17074.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin `wordpress-feed-statistics` contains an open redirect vulnerability. The plugin uses the `feed-stats-url` parameter to redirect users to an external URL. This parameter is decoded using `base64_decode` without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Open redirect vulnerability due to lack of proper sanitization of the `feed-stats-url` parameter.
- Lack of URL validation or domain whitelisting, allowing redirect to any URL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can craft a malicious URL that, when clicked, redirects the user to a malicious site.
- This can be used for phishing attacks, drive-by downloads, or other malicious activities.
- Users may be tricked into visiting malicious websites disguised as legitimate links from the blog.

**Attack vectors:**
- By crafting a malicious URL with a `feed-stats-url` parameter containing a base64 encoded malicious URL.
- The attacker can distribute this crafted URL through emails, social media, or other channels, luring users into clicking the link.
- When a user clicks on this link, the plugin redirects the user to the attacker's specified malicious URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the `feed-stats-url` parameter.
- No other special capabilities or position is required.

**Additional details:**
- The code includes a check for whitelisted redirects based on the post content, however, this check is flawed and can be easily bypassed.
- The plugin attempts to track clickthroughs by rewriting URLs in the feed content using a regex. It uses `base64_encode` and `urlencode` to pass the target url in a query parameter.
- The code attempts to sanitize the URL using `esc_url` but this is ineffective if a malicious URL is provided.
- The vulnerability is present in the `init` function of the `FEED_STATS` class, specifically at lines 58-131 in the file `feed-statistics.php`.
