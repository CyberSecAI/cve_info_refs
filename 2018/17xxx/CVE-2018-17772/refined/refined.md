Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-17772:

**Summary:**

The provided materials describe a vulnerability in Ingenico Tellium 2 payment terminals (identified as CVE-2018-17772) that allows for arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability is related to the TRACE protocol and allows for read/write access to memory. This can be exploited by an attacker to gain control of the device. The videos and the PT Security article detail research into payment terminal security, including this vulnerability.

**Details:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the implementation of the TRACE protocol within the Ingenico Tellium 2 operating system. The specific flaw is not detailed, but it's related to how the protocol handles memory access, allowing arbitrary read/write operations.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Insecure Protocol:** The TRACE protocol is insecurely implemented, allowing for arbitrary memory access.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:** The protocol likely lacks proper input validation, allowing attackers to send malicious requests that can manipulate memory.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the payment terminal, allowing them to take full control of the device.
    *   **Data Theft:** With arbitrary code execution, attackers can potentially intercept or modify payment card data, including sensitive information like PINs, track data, and card numbers.
    *   **Malware Installation:**  Attackers can install malware on the terminal for further malicious activities.
    *   **Device Takeover:** Complete device compromise, allowing the attacker to use the terminal for other malicious purposes.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Physical Access:**  While the CVSS vector indicates a physical attack vector, the videos discuss maintenance interfaces like USB and network protocols (PPP), which indicates these could be attack vectors. 
    *   **Network Exploitation:** The Ingenico software (LLT) that uses PPP over USB has hardcoded credentials and clear text communications. An attacker could use this to gain access.
    *   **Debug Interfaces:** The video mentions that debug interfaces can be used to gain access.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Initial Access:** Attackers require either physical access to the device to use the debug interfaces or access to the payment terminal network to use the LLT software.
    *   **Technical Expertise:** The attacker needs to have a technical understanding of the TRACE protocol, reverse engineering skills to analyze the device firmware and the ability to craft malicious requests to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by researchers at Positive Technologies (mentioned in the PT Security article).
*   The vendor (Ingenico) was informed of the vulnerability in 2018, and a fix was released in 2020, highlighting a significant delay.
*   The videos also highlight a common weakness across many payment terminals â€“ the failure to change default maintenance passwords, which opens the door to exploitation of maintenance interfaces.
*   The videos describe a variety of other vulnerabilities, including weak crypto, exposed debug interfaces, and insecure protocols.
