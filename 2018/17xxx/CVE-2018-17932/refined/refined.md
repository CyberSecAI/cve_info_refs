- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The JUUKO K-800 industrial radio remote control is vulnerable to replay attacks due to a lack of proper authentication mechanisms.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay (CWE-294). The device is susceptible to a replay attack and command forgery.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow attackers to replay commands, control the device, view commands, or cause the device to stop running.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker on an adjacent network can capture and replay commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device and possess the ability to capture network traffic. The attacker also needs the technical skills to replay captured commands.
