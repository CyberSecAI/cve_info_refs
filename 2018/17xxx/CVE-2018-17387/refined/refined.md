{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can modify the admin profile, including name, email, and password, leading to account takeover and unauthorized access.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is a malicious web page or link that, when visited by an authenticated user, submits a forged request to the vulnerable application's server. This leverages the user's existing authenticated session.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to lure an authenticated user to visit a malicious web page containing the crafted CSRF attack. The attacker does not need to know the current admin's password, just that they have a valid session with the application."
