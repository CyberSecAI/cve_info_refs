{
  "CVE-2018-17336": {
    "description": "A malformed file system label can trigger a string format vulnerability in udisks.",
    "root_cause": "The `udisks_log` function in `udiskslogging.c` uses a format string vulnerability when handling filesystem labels, which can be user-controlled.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Format string vulnerability."
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker could cause a denial of service (crash) or potentially achieve arbitrary memory manipulation due to the use of the `%n` modifier. It could also lead to information disclosure by leaking stack contents through format specifiers.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access required to trigger the vulnerability."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to create or modify a file system with a malformed label.  This could be done by inserting a USB device or by having privileges that allow mounting devices with udisksctl."
  }
