Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from unsanitized user input being directly incorporated into an SQL query within the `rex_list` class. Specifically, the `sort` parameter from the HTTP request is used to construct the `ORDER BY` clause of the SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, caused by the lack of sanitization of the `sort` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive data from the database.
*   **Data Modification/Deletion:** Attackers could modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Denial of Service:** An attacker could use time-based SQL injection (as shown in the proof of concept) to cause delays or potentially a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Parameter Manipulation:** The vulnerability is exploited by manipulating the `sort` parameter within an HTTP request to a page that uses the vulnerable `rex_list` class.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected REDAXO instance.
*   The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated, as the vulnerability is present in the `rex_list` class, which is used in both the backend and frontend.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of the `list` parameter to target the correct list and inject the malicious `sort` parameter.

**More details than official CVE:**

*   The provided content offers a detailed explanation of the vulnerability, including the vulnerable code snippets in `list.php`, the specific function `getSortColumn` that retrieves the unsanitized input, and a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating time-based SQL injection using `sleep()` function. The official CVE description is a placeholder and does not provide any of these technical details.
*   The vulnerability is located in the `rex_list` class, which means it could affect both backend and frontend of the application.
*   The vulnerable versions are all REDAXO versions <= 5.6.2
*   The issue was reported by @Balis0ng, ADLab of VenusTech.
