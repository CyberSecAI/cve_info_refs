{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `wireless` module in TP-Link WR886N V7 allows users to set WLAN power parameters via HTTP POST requests. Input validation is insufficient, leading to a buffer overflow when a long value is provided for a specific JSON key.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer Overflow due to insufficient input validation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit can crash the `wireless` module configuration file and, if the overflow string is long enough, crash the `inetd` task. This leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) by stopping most network services such as HTTP, DNS, and UPnP.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through crafting and sending a malicious HTTP POST request to the router's web interface. The malicious request includes an oversized string in the `power` parameter within the `wlan_host_2g` JSON object.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router's web interface. This typically implies the attacker is on the same network or has access to the web interface from another network.",
    "Additional Details": "The provided proof of concept (PoC) script automates the exploit by generating the necessary HTTP request with an oversized string to cause the overflow."
