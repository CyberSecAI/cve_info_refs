Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**CVE-2018-17024** is related to a Stored XSS vulnerability in Monstra CMS version 3.0.4, as reported in issue #458 on GitHub.

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `page_meta_title` parameter, before storing it in the database.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application does not properly encode or sanitize the `page_meta_title` parameter before storing and rendering it, allowing malicious JavaScript to be injected and executed when the page is viewed.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the page meta title. This code will be executed in the context of any user who views the page, allowing the attacker to perform actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting users, or defacing the website.
*  **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious payload (JavaScript code) and submits it in the `page_meta_title` parameter when creating or editing a page.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as a user who has the permission to create/edit pages in the admin panel to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional information from other GitHub issue #452:**
*   The vulnerability also affects monstra-dev.
*   The vulnerability is present when creating a new page, specifically injecting malicious javascript in the name parameter when creating a new page.

In summary, both issues are related to Stored XSS vulnerabilities in Monstra CMS, stemming from the lack of proper sanitization of user input during page creation/edition, which is stored and later rendered without proper encoding, allowing the execution of malicious JavaScript.
