Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-17972:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The official description for CVE-2018-17972 is: "An issue was discovered in the proc\_pid\_stack function in fs/proc/base.c in the Linux kernel through 4.18.11. It does not ensure that only root may inspect the kernel stack of an arbitrary task, allowing a local attacker to exploit racy stack unwinding and leak kernel task stack contents."
   - Several documents explicitly mention CVE-2018-17972 and describe the same vulnerability, which is a leak of kernel stack contents via the `/proc/<PID>/stack` file. This confirms the content relates to the specified CVE.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

   - **Root Cause:** A flaw exists in the `proc_pid_stack` function in `fs/proc/base.c`, specifically that it doesn't restrict access to the `/proc/*/stack` files to privileged users. This allows unprivileged users to trigger a race condition in the stack unwinder, resulting in the leakage of kernel stack contents.

   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
        - Information Disclosure: Unprivileged users can access the `/proc/*/stack` files, which contain sensitive kernel data.
        - Race Condition: The stack unwinder code has a race condition that can be triggered by unprivileged users.
        - Lack of Access Control: The Linux kernel fails to restrict access to kernel stack information.

   - **Impact of Exploitation:**
        - Information Leakage: Kernel stack contents, potentially containing sensitive data, can be leaked to unprivileged users.
        - Potential Privilege Escalation: Although not directly demonstrated, information leakage could be used as a stepping stone in further attacks.

   - **Attack Vectors:**
        - Local Access: An attacker must have local access to the system to exploit this vulnerability.
        - Direct File Access: The vulnerability is exploited by accessing files such as `/proc/<PID>/stack` directly.

   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
        - Local user account on the affected system.
        - No root access is initially required to trigger the vulnerability, although root is needed to read files that leak information.

**3. Additional Details Not in the CVE Description (From the analyzed content):**

    -  The fix involves restricting access to the `/proc/*/stack` files to users with the `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability, which is typically held only by the root user.
    - The Suse and RedHat documents note that this issue was fixed with kernel updates.
    -  Debian also applied a fix for this vulnerability in their LTS kernel, which included several other CVE fixes related to race conditions and type confusion vulnerabilities.
    - Ubuntu specifically notes that the vulnerability exists in the procfs file system implementation which "did not properly restrict the ability to inspect the kernel stack of an arbitrary task."  They also specify that a local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.

**4. Summary of Relevant Information:**

The vulnerability CVE-2018-17972 allows unprivileged local users to read kernel stack information. This is due to inadequate access controls and a race condition in the stack unwinder. The primary impact is an information leak that can be triggered by accessing procfs files, but it may contribute to broader attacks. The primary fix restricts access to the affected files to privileged users. This CVE has been fixed in different ways by several Linux distributions as detailed in the extracted content.
