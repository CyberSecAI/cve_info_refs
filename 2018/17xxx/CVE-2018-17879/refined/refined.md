Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2018-17879:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation in CGI scripts used to control and configure the camera. Specifically, user-provided input is passed directly to the `system()` command without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **OS Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the direct use of user-controlled input in a `system()` call, allowing for OS command injection. This means an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of the camera.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution on the camera with root privileges.
*   **Complete Device Control:** An attacker gains full control of the camera.
*   **Lateral Movement:** The compromised camera can be used to attack other devices on the same network.
*   **Data Manipulation/Destruction:** Attackers can change, pause, delete camera images, or disable the device.
*   **Denial of Service:** Attackers can shut down or otherwise disable the camera remotely.
*   **Privacy Violation:** Attackers can access video feeds.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network using HTTP requests.
*   **CGI Scripts:** Attackers target specific CGI scripts responsible for camera settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the camera's web interface.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker needs to identify vulnerable input parameters within the CGI scripts (e.g., the `UPnP HTTP Port` parameter, in the provided exploit).
*   **Basic understanding of OS command injection:** Attacker must be able to craft malicious input strings to be executed by the system.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The specific exploit example provided utilizes the `General.Network.UPnP.NATTraversal.HTTPPort` parameter to inject commands.
*   The exploit uses the `$(...)` construct to execute commands.
*   The exploit includes cleanup to restore the `UPnP HTTP Port` parameter to its original value after injecting the attack
*   The content also provides a complete python script for demonstrating the exploit
