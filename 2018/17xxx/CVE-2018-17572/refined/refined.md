Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the "Write Data Module" of the InfluxDB admin panel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is that the application does not sanitize user-provided input when writing data, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and store malicious JavaScript, which will then execute within the browsers of other users who access the affected pages/functionalities within the InfluxDB admin panel.
- **Session Hijacking:** If the admin user is compromised, the attacker could perform administrative tasks and potentially exfiltrate data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Admin Panel:** An attacker with access to the admin panel can inject malicious scripts through the "Write Data Module."

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Admin Access:** The attacker needs administrative privileges or some level of access to the "Write Data Module" within the InfluxDB admin panel.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided gist indicates that versions up to 0.9.5 of InfluxDB are affected.
- The fix involves upgrading to the latest version of InfluxDB, implying that input validation and sanitization was implemented in later versions to prevent XSS.
- The injection point is the "Write Data Module"
- The exploit is stored XSS, so the malicious code is permanently stored on the database and is executed each time it is accessed.
