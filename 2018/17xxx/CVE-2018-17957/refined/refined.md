Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-17957:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `yast2-rmt` module was passing MySQL database passwords as command-line arguments when executing `mysql` commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Exposure of sensitive information: MySQL passwords were being exposed in the process list, making them visible to local users who could potentially access the process list.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized Access: Local attackers could potentially gain access to the RMT database using the exposed credentials.
- Data Corruption: With access to the database, an attacker could corrupt or modify the RMT database.
- The CVSS score indicates a confidentiality and integrity impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access: The vulnerability is exploitable by local attackers who have the ability to view process lists.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have local access to the system where `yast2-rmt` is running.
- The attacker must have the ability to view process lists.
- The attacker needs to be in a position to observe the command line arguments being passed to the mysql client.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in `yast2-rmt` versions prior to 1.1.2
- The fix involved changing the way passwords are passed to the `mysql` command.
- The suggested fix is to use a mysql option file to pass the password instead.
- The vulnerability has been fixed in updated versions of the yast2-rmt package across multiple SUSE and openSUSE products.
