  "CVE-2018-17678": {
    "related_to_description": true,
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists due to the lack of input validation within the `gotoNamedDest` method of the app object. Specifically, the code fails to verify if an object exists before performing operations on it.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-After-Free"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. This could allow attackers to completely compromise the system running the affected software.",
    "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker can trigger this vulnerability by crafting a malicious PDF file or a website that exploits the vulnerable `gotoNamedDest` method. The target user must then interact with this malicious content by opening the PDF or visiting the crafted webpage.",
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious PDF files or control web content visited by the victim. The attacker does not need prior access or credentials to the targeted system."
