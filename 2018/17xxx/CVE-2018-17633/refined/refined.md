  "CVE-2018-17633": {
    "related_to_description": true,
    "root_cause": "The specific flaw exists within the handling of the subject property of Annotation objects. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-After-Free"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious page or file that triggers the use-after-free in the handling of Annotation objects and the target user needs to interact with it (open or visit).",
   "additional_details": "The vulnerability is a use-after-free triggered in the handling of the subject property of Annotation objects because the application lacks validation of the existence of the object before performing operations. This can lead to remote code execution. Foxit has issued an update to correct this vulnerability."
