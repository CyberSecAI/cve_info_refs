## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel
* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-gcp](/security/cves?package=linux-gcp) - Linux kernel for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) systems
* [linux-kvm](/security/cves?package=linux-kvm) - Linux kernel for cloud environments

* [linux-raspi2](/security/cves?package=linux-raspi2) - Linux kernel for Raspberry Pi 2

## Details

Jann Horn discovered that the vmacache subsystem did not properly handle

sequence number overflows, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-17182](/security/CVE-2018-17182))

It was discovered that the paravirtualization implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle some indirect calls, reducing the

effectiveness of Spectre v2 mitigations for paravirtual guests. A local

attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-15594](/security/CVE-2018-15594))

It was discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and

prediction of return addresses via Return Stack Buffer (RSB) may allow

unauthorized memory reads via sidechannel attacks. An attacker could use

this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-15572](/security/CVE-2018-15572))

Andy Lutomirski and Mika Penttil√§ discovered that the KVM implementation

in the Linux kernel did not properly check privilege levels when emulating

some instructions. An unprivileged attacker in a guest VM could use this to

escalate privileges within the guest. ([CVE-2018-10853](/security/CVE-2018-10853))

It was discovered that a stack-based buffer overflow existed in the iSCSI

target implementation of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-14633](/security/CVE-2018-14633))

It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the IRDA subsystem of the

Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2018-6554](/security/CVE-2018-6554))

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the IRDA

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-6555](/security/CVE-2018-6555))

USN 3652-1 added a mitigation for Speculative Store Bypass

a.k.a. Spectre Variant 4 ([CVE-2018-3639](/security/CVE-2018-3639)). This update provides the

corresponding mitigation for ARM64 processors. Please note that for

this mitigation to be effective, an updated firmware for the processor

may be required.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-1023-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws)
  -
  [4.15.0-1023.23](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws/4.15.0-1023.23)

* [linux-image-4.15.0-1024-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2)
  -
  [4.15.0-1024.26](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2/4.15.0-1024.26)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-36-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.15.0-36.39](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.15.0-36.39)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-36-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.15.0-36.39](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.15.0-36.39)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-36-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.15.0-36.39](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.15.0-36.39)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-36-snapdragon](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.15.0-36.39](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.15.0-36.39)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-lts-xenial](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-xenial) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Xenial for Trusty

## Details

USN-3776-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu

14.04 LTS.

Jann Horn discovered that the vmacache subsystem did not properly handle

sequence number overflows, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-17182](/security/CVE-2018-17182))

It was discovered that the paravirtualization implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle some indirect calls, reducing the

effectiveness of Spectre v2 mitigations for paravirtual guests. A local

attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-15594](/security/CVE-2018-15594))

It was discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and

prediction of return addresses via Return Stack Buffer (RSB) may allow

unauthorized memory reads via sidechannel attacks. An attacker could use

this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-15572](/security/CVE-2018-15572))

It was discovered that a NULL pointer dereference could be triggered in the

OCFS2 file system implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2017-18216](/security/CVE-2017-18216))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the raw MIDI driver for

the Linux kernel, leading to a double free vulnerability. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-10902](/security/CVE-2018-10902))

It was discovered that a stack-based buffer overflow existed in the iSCSI

target implementation of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-14633](/security/CVE-2018-14633))

It was discovered that the YUREX USB device driver for the Linux kernel did

not properly restrict user space reads or writes. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-16276](/security/CVE-2018-16276))

It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the IRDA subsystem of the

Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2018-6554](/security/CVE-2018-6554))

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the IRDA

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-6555](/security/CVE-2018-6555))

mm: get rid of vmacache\_flush\_all() entirely

```
Jann Horn points out that the vmacache_flush_all() function is not only
potentially expensive, it's buggy too.  It also happens to be entirely
unnecessary, because the sequence number overflow case can be avoided by
simply making the sequence number be 64-bit.  That doesn't even grow the
data structures in question, because the other adjacent fields are
already 64-bit.

So simplify the whole thing by just making the sequence number overflow
case go away entirely, which gets rid of all the complications and makes
the code faster too.  Win-win.

[ Oleg Nesterov points out that the VMACACHE_FULL_FLUSHES statistics
  also just goes away entirely with this ]

mm: get rid of vmacache\_flush\_all() entirelyJann Horn points out that the vmacache\_flush\_all() function is not only
potentially expensive, it's buggy too. It also happens to be entirely
unnecessary, because the sequence number overflow case can be avoided by
simply making the sequence number be 64-bit. That doesn't even grow the
data structures in question, because the other adjacent fields are
already 64-bit.
So simplify the whole thing by just making the sequence number overflow
case go away entirely, which gets rid of all the complications and makes
the code faster too. Win-win.
[ Oleg Nesterov points out that the VMACACHE\_FULL\_FLUSHES statistics
also just goes away entirely with this ]

A local attacker with permission to create KVM-based virtual machines can both panic the hypervisor by triggering an illegal exception return (resulting in a DoS) and to redirect execution elsewhere within the hypervisor with full register control, instead of causing a return to the guest.

# Linux Kernel - VMA Use-After-Free via Buggy vmacache\_flush\_all() Fastpath Local Privilege Escalation

**Vulnerable App:**

```
Since commit 615d6e8756c8 ("mm: per-thread vma caching", first in 3.15),
Linux has per-task VMA caches that contain up to four VMA pointers for
fast lookup. VMA caches are invalidated by bumping the 32-bit per-mm
sequence number mm->vmacache_seqnum; when the sequence number wraps,
vmacache_flush_all() scans through all running tasks and wipes the
VMA caches of all tasks that share current's mm.

In commit 6b4ebc3a9078 ("mm,vmacache: optimize overflow system-wide
flushing", first in 3.16), a bogus fastpath was added that skips the
invalidation on overflow if current->mm->mm_users==1. This means that
the following sequence of events triggers a use-after-free:

[A starts as a singlethreaded process]
A: create mappings X and Y (in separate memory areas
   far away from other allocations)
A: perform repeated invalidations until
   current->mm->vmacache_seqnum==0xffffffff and
   current->vmacache.seqnum==0xfffffffe
A: dereference an address in mapping Y that is not
   paged in (thereby populating A's VMA cache with
   Y at seqnum 0xffffffff)
A: unmap mapping X (thereby bumping
   current->mm->vmacache_seqnum to 0)
A: without any more find_vma() calls (which could
   happen e.g. via pagefaults), create a thread B
B: perform repeated invalidations until
   current->mm->vmacache_seqnum==0xfffffffe
B: unmap mapping Y (thereby bumping
   current->mm->vmacache_seqnum to 0xffffffff)
A: dereference an address in the freed mapping Y
   (or any address that isn't present in the
   pagetables and doesn't correspond to a valid
   VMA cache entry)

A's VMA cache is still at sequence number 0xffffffff from before the
overflow. The sequence number has wrapped around in the meantime, back
to 0xffffffff, and A's outdated VMA cache is considered to be valid.

I am attaching the following reproduction files:

vmacache-debugging.patch: Kernel patch that adds some extra logging for
                          VMA cache internals.
vma_test.c: Reproducer code
dmesg: dmesg output of running the reproducer in a VM

In a Debian 9 VM, I've tested the reproducer against a 4.19.0-rc3+
kernel with vmacache-debugging.patch applied, configured with
CONFIG_DEBUG_VM_VMACACHE=y.

Usage:

user@debian:~/vma_bug$ gcc -O2 -o vma_test vma_test.c -g && ./vma_test
Segmentation fault

Within around 40 minutes, I get the following warning in dmesg:

##### About The Exploit Database

√ó

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as ‚ÄúGoogle Hacking‚Äù was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny‚Äôs talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term ‚ÄúGoogledork‚Äù to refer
to ‚Äúa foolish or inept person as revealed by Google‚Äú. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a ‚ÄúGoogle problem‚Äù but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term ‚Äúdork‚Äù became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and ‚Äúdorks‚Äù were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

                 CVE-2018-16658 CVE-2018-17182

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2018-6554

    A memory leak in the irda_bind function in the irda subsystem was
    discovered. A local user can take advantage of this flaw to cause a
    denial of service (memory consumption).

CVE-2018-6555

    A flaw was discovered in the irda_setsockopt function in the irda
    subsystem, allowing a local user to cause a denial of service
    (use-after-free and system crash).

CVE-2018-7755

    Brian Belleville discovered a flaw in the fd_locked_ioctl function
    in the floppy driver in the Linux kernel. The floppy driver copies a
    kernel pointer to user memory in response to the FDGETPRM ioctl. A
    local user with access to a floppy drive device can take advantage
    of this flaw to discover the location kernel code and data.

CVE-2018-9363

    It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation did not
    correctly check the length of received report messages. A paired
    HIDP device could use this to cause a buffer overflow, leading to
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or potentially
    remote code execution.

CVE-2018-9516

    It was discovered that the HID events interface in debugfs did not
    correctly limit the length of copies to user buffers.  A local
    user with access to these files could use this to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.  However, by default debugfs is only
    accessible by the root user.

CVE-2018-10902

    It was discovered that the rawmidi kernel driver does not protect
    against concurrent access which leads to a double-realloc (double
    free) flaw. A local attacker can take advantage of this issue for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-10938

    Yves Younan from Cisco reported that the Cipso IPv4 module did not
    correctly check the length of IPv4 options. On custom kernels with
    CONFIG_NETLABEL enabled, a remote attacker could use this to cause
    a denial of service (hang).

CVE-2018-13099

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported a use-after-free bug in the
    F2FS implementation. An attacker able to mount a crafted F2FS
    volume could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-14609

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported a potential null pointer
    dereference in the F2FS implementation. An attacker able to mount
    a crafted F2FS volume could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-14617

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported a potential null pointer
    dereference in the HFS+ implementation. An attacker able to mount
    a crafted HFS+ volume could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-14633

    Vincent Pelletier discovered a stack-based buffer overflow flaw in
    the chap_server_compute_md5() function in the iSCSI target code. An
    unauthenticated remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to
    cause a denial of service or possibly to get a non-authorized access
    to data exported by an iSCSI target.

CVE-2018-14678

    M. Vefa Bicakci and Andy Lutomirski discovered a flaw in the
    kernel exit code used on amd64 systems running as Xen PV guests.
    A local user could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2018-14734

    A use-after-free bug was discovered in the InfiniBand
    communication manager. A local user could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possible for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-15572

    Esmaiel Mohammadian Koruyeh, Khaled Khasawneh, Chengyu Song, and
    Nael Abu-Ghazaleh, from University of California, Riverside,
    reported a variant of Spectre variant 2, dubbed SpectreRSB. A
    local user may be able to use this to read sensitive information
    from processes owned by other users.

CVE-2018-15594

    Nadav Amit reported that some indirect function calls used in
    paravirtualised guests were vulnerable to Spectre variant 2.  A
    local user may be able to use this to read sensitive information
    from the kernel.

CVE-2018-16276

    Jann Horn discovered that the yurex driver did not correctly limit
    the length of copies to user buffers.  A local user with access to
    a yurex device node could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-16658

    It was discovered that the cdrom driver does not correctly
    validate the parameter to the CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS ioctl.  A user
    with access to a cdrom device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-17182

    Jann Horn discovered that the vmacache_flush_all function mishandles
    sequence number overflows. A local user can take advantage of this
    flaw to trigger a use-after-free, causing a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or privilege escalation.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.110-3+deb9u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

                 CVE-2018-16658 CVE-2018-17182

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2018-6554

    A memory leak in the irda_bind function in the irda subsystem was
    discovered. A local user can take advantage of this flaw to cause a
    denial of service (memory consumption).

CVE-2018-6555

    A flaw was discovered in the irda_setsockopt function in the irda
    subsystem, allowing a local user to cause a denial of service
    (use-after-free and system crash).

CVE-2018-7755

    Brian Belleville discovered a flaw in the fd_locked_ioctl function
    in the floppy driver in the Linux kernel. The floppy driver copies a
    kernel pointer to user memory in response to the FDGETPRM ioctl. A
    local user with access to a floppy drive device can take advantage
    of this flaw to discover the location kernel code and data.

CVE-2018-9363

    It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation did not
    correctly check the length of received report messages. A paired
    HIDP device could use this to cause a buffer overflow, leading to
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or potentially
    remote code execution.

CVE-2018-9516

    It was discovered that the HID events interface in debugfs did not
    correctly limit the length of copies to user buffers.  A local
    user with access to these files could use this to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.  However, by default debugfs is only
    accessible by the root user.

CVE-2018-10902

    It was discovered that the rawmidi kernel driver does not protect
    against concurrent access which leads to a double-realloc (double
    free) flaw. A local attacker can take advantage of this issue for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-10938

    Yves Younan from Cisco reported that the Cipso IPv4 module did not
    correctly check the length of IPv4 options. On custom kernels with
    CONFIG_NETLABEL enabled, a remote attacker could use this to cause
    a denial of service (hang).

CVE-2018-13099

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported a use-after-free bug in the
    F2FS implementation. An attacker able to mount a crafted F2FS
    volume could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-14609

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported a potential null pointer
    dereference in the F2FS implementation. An attacker able to mount
    arbitrary F2FS volumes could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-14617

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported a potential null pointer
    dereference in the HFS+ implementation. An attacker able to mount
    arbitrary HFS+ volumes could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-14633

    Vincent Pelletier discovered a stack-based buffer overflow flaw in
    the chap_server_compute_md5() function in the iSCSI target code. An
    unauthenticated remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to
    cause a denial of service or possibly to get a non-authorized access
    to data exported by an iSCSI target.

CVE-2018-14678

    M. Vefa Bicakci and Andy Lutomirski discovered a flaw in the
    kernel exit code used on amd64 systems running as Xen PV guests.
    A local user could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2018-14734

    A use-after-free bug was discovered in the InfiniBand
    communication manager. A local user could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possible for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-15572

    Esmaiel Mohammadian Koruyeh, Khaled Khasawneh, Chengyu Song, and
    Nael Abu-Ghazaleh, from University of California, Riverside,
    reported a variant of Spectre variant 2, dubbed SpectreRSB. A
    local user may be able to use this to read sensitive information
    from processes owned by other users.

CVE-2018-15594

    Nadav Amit reported that some indirect function calls used in
    paravirtualised guests were vulnerable to Spectre variant 2.  A
    local user may be able to use this to read sensitive information
    from the kernel.

CVE-2018-16276

    Jann Horn discovered that the yurex driver did not correctly limit
    the length of copies to user buffers.  A local user with access to
    a yurex device node could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-16658

    It was discovered that the cdrom driver does not correctly
    validate the parameter to the CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS ioctl.  A user
    with access to a cdrom device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-17182

    Jann Horn discovered that the vmacache_flush_all function mishandles
    sequence number overflows. A local user can take advantage of this
    flaw to trigger a use-after-free, causing a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or privilege escalation.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.110-3+deb9u5~deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.9 packages.

## [Variant4](/SecurityTeam/KnowledgeBase/Variant4)

## Speculative Store Bypass (CVE-2018-3639 aka GPZ Variant 4)

Ken Johnson of the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) and Jann Horn of Google Project Zero (GPZ) independently [discovered another variant](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1528) of a cache speculation timing side channel attack, similar to the issues previously disclosed under the names [Spectre and Meltdown](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/KnowledgeBase/SpectreAndMeltdown).

With this variant, currently known as Variant 4, systems with microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and speculative execution of a memory read, before the addresses of all prior memory writes are known, may allow unauthorized disclosure of information to an attacker with local user access via a side channel analysis. More colloquially, in one example, Variant 4 can reveal the value of stored data when a load following a store speculatively retrieves the earlier value.

### Mitigations

Some mitigations for Spectre v2 also help to mitigate some of the effects of this vulnerability, for example, the reduction in timer precision in browsers renders this variant much more difficult to exploit.

The Speculative Store Bypass vulnerability can be mitigated by setting the newly defined Speculative Store Bypass Disable (SSBD) bit in the IA32\_SPEC\_CTRL Model-Specific Register (MSR) of x86 processors. Support for this mitigation requires updated microcode for Intel processors. New microcode is not needed for AMD processors.

In Ubuntu, SSBD is OFF by default because it is not needed by most programs and carries a notable performance impact. A prctl() has been added (PR\_SPEC\_STORE\_BYPASS) that enables developers to opt into the mitigation on a per process basis. Applications using a seccomp filter will be implicitly opted into the mitigations. This means that strict and devmode snaps, processes inside of LXD containers, sandboxed processes of the Firefox and Chromium browsers, among some other processes running in a default Ubuntu install on x86 processors, will have the SSBD mitigation enabled out of the box.

Users can explicitly opt-in to SSBD mitigations, on a system-wide basis, by booting with the spec\_store\_bypass\_disable=on boot parameter. See the [Mitigation Controls](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/KnowledgeBase/SpectreAndMeltdown/MitigationControls#CVE-2018-3639) page for details on available boot options.

### Update Status

Ubuntu users are recommended to update to the latest kernel, qemu, libvirt, and intel-microcode packages. Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, 17.10, 16.04 LTS, and 14.04 LTS were affected. 12.04 ESM remains affected but updates are in progress.

#### Bare Metal and Virtual Machines with Intel Processors

QEMU and kernel updates were released to allow bare metal Ubuntu systems to make use of SSBD. Additionally, these updates allow virtualized Ubuntu systems to make use of SSBD with x86 Intel processors. Consult the following table for version information:

| **Package** | **USN** |
| --- | --- |
| Linux Kernel (18.04 LTS) | [USN-3652-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3652-1/) |
| Linux Kernel (17.10) | [USN-3653-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3653-1/) |
| Linux Kernel (16.04 LTS) | [USN-3654-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3654-1/), [USN-3653-2](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3653-2/) |
| Linux Kernel (14.04 LTS) | [USN-3655-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3655-1/), [USN-3654-2](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3654-2/) |
| QEMU | [USN-3651-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3651-1/) |
| intel-microcode | [USN-3756-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3756-1/) |

The required intel-microcode updates are not available at this time. Canonical will continue to work with Intel and release intel-microcode updates once they're production ready. In the meantime, you may be able to access updated microcode for your processor in the form of OEM firmware updates.

#### Virtual Machines with AMD Processors

Additional QEMU, libvirt, and kernel updates were released to allow virtual machines to make use of SSBD support with x86 AMD processors. Consult the following table for version information:

| **Package** | **USN** |
| --- | --- |
| Linux Kernel (18.04 LTS) | [USN-3678-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3678-1/), [USN-3678-3](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3678-3/) |
| Linux Kernel (17.10) | [USN-3677-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3677-1/) |
| Linux Kernel (16.04 LTS) | [USN-3676-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3676-1/), [USN-3677-2](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3677-2/), [USN-3678-2](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3678-2/) |
| Linux Kernel (14.04 LTS) | [USN-3674-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3674-1/), [USN-3676-2](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3676-2/) |
| QEMU | [USN-3679-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3679-1/) |
| libvirt | [USN-3680-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3680-1/) |

#### ARM64 Processors

Kernel updates were released to Ubuntu 18.04 LTS to address CVE-2018-3639 on some ARM64 processors. The updated kernels will dynamically mitigate the speculative store bypass vulnerability on [Cortex-A76](https://developer.arm.com/support/arm-security-updates/speculative-processor-vulnerability) and the Cavium [ThunderX2](/ThunderX2) processor family with the appropriate firmware update. Consult the following table for Ubuntu kernel version information:

| **Package** | **USN** |
| --- | --- |
| Linux Kernel (18.04 LTS) | [USN-3777-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3777-1/) |
| Linux HWE Kernel (16.04 LTS) | [USN-3777-2](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3777-2/) |

### Verifying Your System

To check if your system is protected against CVE-2018-3639, you can run the following command and compare the output:
```
  $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spec_store_bypass
  Mitigation: Speculative Store Bypass disabled via prctl and seccomp
```

The example above shows a system that is mitigated against CVE-2018-3639.

A system that is not running an updated kernel will not have the file indicating the vulnerability status and the system should be considered vulnerable:
```
  $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spec_store_bypass
  cat: /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spec_store_bypass: No such file or directory
```

If the file exists but the system does not have updated microcode, or an updated hypervisor in the case of a virtual machine, the output will indicate that the system is vulnerable:
```
  $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spec_store_bypass
  Vulnerable
```

### Configuration as a Hypervisor

**IMPORTANT:** As outlined above using ssbd is not strictly required, but as a hypervisor you might want/need to leave the decision to opt into this feature to your guests. To be able to do so you need to make the ssbd feature available to them.

#### QEMU/KVM

From QEMUs point of view the ssbd CPU feature is not part of any pre-defined cpu models. On a Host with the required CPU microcode to support the feature it can be explicitly turned on to be usable by the guest.

You can check if the host system has the ssbd feature used to mitigate this issue with:

```
$ grep 'ssbd' /proc/cpuinfo
  flags           : ... ssbd
```

If the above is true then the ssbd feature will automatically be passed to the guest when using the CPU model host. For all other CPU models the feature needs to be added explicitly. For example if before you had used the CPU model *Haswell* the respective part of the command line would then have look like:

```
    -cpu Haswell,+ssbd
```

#### Libvirt

You can check your stack of Firmware, Kernel, QEMU and Libvirt is ready to expose the ssbd flag to guests by checking the capabilities.

```
$ virsh domcapabilities kvm | grep ssbd
    <feature policy='require' name='ssbd'/>
```

If the above is true then the ssbd feature will automatically be passed to the guest in the CPU modes host-passthrough and host-model.

In all other cases the definition of the CPU that is presented to the guest needs to be modified. You can do so in the [guests CPU element](https://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsCPU). While the rest of the CPU model specification depends on your case, adding the ssbd feature is the same and will look like

```
<cpu ...
    <feature policy='require' name='ssbd'/>
</cpu>
```

**IMPORTANT:** Even if you have a configuration - for example using host-passthrough - that does not need a configuration change, still guests needs to be fully shut down and restarted to pick up the new feature flags.

## Details

Jann Horn discovered that the vmacache subsystem did not properly handle

sequence number overflows, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-17182](/security/CVE-2018-17182))

It was discovered that the paravirtualization implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle some indirect calls, reducing the

effectiveness of Spectre v2 mitigations for paravirtual guests. A local

attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-15594](/security/CVE-2018-15594))

It was discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and

prediction of return addresses via Return Stack Buffer (RSB) may allow

unauthorized memory reads via sidechannel attacks. An attacker could use

this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-15572](/security/CVE-2018-15572))

It was discovered that a NULL pointer dereference could be triggered in the

OCFS2 file system implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2017-18216](/security/CVE-2017-18216))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the raw MIDI driver for

the Linux kernel, leading to a double free vulnerability. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-10902](/security/CVE-2018-10902))

It was discovered that a stack-based buffer overflow existed in the iSCSI

target implementation of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-14633](/security/CVE-2018-14633))

It was discovered that the YUREX USB device driver for the Linux kernel did

not properly restrict user space reads or writes. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-16276](/security/CVE-2018-16276))

It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the IRDA subsystem of the

Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2018-6554](/security/CVE-2018-6554))

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the IRDA

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-6555](/security/CVE-2018-6555))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users‚Äô data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program‚Äôs source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat‚Äôs CVE database.

When a technology‚Äîenabled and most likely used by default‚Äîcompletely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking¬† and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.¬† CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.¬† In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.¬† In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.¬† For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.¬† The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Details

USN-3777-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 18.04

%LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the

Linux kernel for Azure Cloud systems.

Jann Horn discovered that the vmacache subsystem did not properly handle

sequence number overflows, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-17182](/security/CVE-2018-17182))

It was discovered that the paravirtualization implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle some indirect calls, reducing the

effectiveness of Spectre v2 mitigations for paravirtual guests. A local

attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-15594](/security/CVE-2018-15594))

It was discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and

prediction of return addresses via Return Stack Buffer (RSB) may allow

unauthorized memory reads via sidechannel attacks. An attacker could use

this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-15572](/security/CVE-2018-15572))

Jann Horn discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution

and branch prediction may allow unauthorized memory reads via sidechannel

attacks. This flaw is known as Spectre. A local attacker could use this to

expose sensitive information, including kernel memory. ([CVE-2017-5715](/security/CVE-2017-5715))

It was discovered that a stack-based buffer overflow existed in the iSCSI

target implementation of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-14633](/security/CVE-2018-14633))

Jann Horn and Ken Johnson discovered that microprocessors utilizing

speculative execution of a memory read may allow unauthorized memory reads

via a sidechannel attack. This flaw is known as Spectre Variant 4. A local

attacker could use this to expose sensitive information, including kernel

memory. ([CVE-2018-3639](/security/CVE-2018-3639))

It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the IRDA subsystem of the

Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2018-6554](/security/CVE-2018-6554))

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the IRDA

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-6555](/security/CVE-2018-6555))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

##### Ubuntu 16.04

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux-gcp](/security/cves?package=linux-gcp) - Linux kernel for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) systems
* [linux-hwe](/security/cves?package=linux-hwe) - Linux hardware enablement (HWE) kernel

## Details

USN-3777-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 18.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 18.04 LTS for Ubuntu

16.04 LTS.

Jann Horn discovered that the vmacache subsystem did not properly handle

sequence number overflows, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-17182](/security/CVE-2018-17182))

It was discovered that the paravirtualization implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle some indirect calls, reducing the

effectiveness of Spectre v2 mitigations for paravirtual guests. A local

attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-15594](/security/CVE-2018-15594))

It was discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and

prediction of return addresses via Return Stack Buffer (RSB) may allow

unauthorized memory reads via sidechannel attacks. An attacker could use

this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-15572](/security/CVE-2018-15572))

Andy Lutomirski and Mika Penttil√§ discovered that the KVM implementation

in the Linux kernel did not properly check privilege levels when emulating

some instructions. An unprivileged attacker in a guest VM could use this to

escalate privileges within the guest. ([CVE-2018-10853](/security/CVE-2018-10853))

It was discovered that a stack-based buffer overflow existed in the iSCSI

target implementation of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-14633](/security/CVE-2018-14633))

It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the IRDA subsystem of the

Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2018-6554](/security/CVE-2018-6554))

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the IRDA

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-6555](/security/CVE-2018-6555))

USN 3653-2 added a mitigation for Speculative Store Bypass

a.k.a. Spectre Variant 4 ([CVE-2018-3639](/security/CVE-2018-3639)). This update provides the

corresponding mitigation for ARM64 processors. Please note that for

this mitigation to be effective, an updated firmware for the processor

may be required.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-36-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-36.39~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.15.0-36.39~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-36-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-36.39~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.15.0-36.39~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-36-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-36.39~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.15.0-36.39~16.04.1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

Subject: Linux kernel: potential local priviledge escalation bug in vmacache code

Hi,

A potential local priviledge escalation bug was reported in the vmacache code dealing with 32-bit sequence number overflows, introduced in v3.16 by 6b4ebc3a9078 (mm,vmacache: optimize overflow system-wide flushing). The change introduces a "fastpath" which skips the invalidation on overflows for single threads (mm_users == 1), which can lead to a use-after-free. As reported:
`
 [A starts as a singlethreaded process]
A: create mappings X and Y (in separate memory areas far away from other allocations)
A: perform repeated invalidations until current->mm->vmacache_seqnum==0xffffffff and current->vmacache.seqnum==0xfffffffe
A: dereference an address in mapping Y that is not paged in (thereby populating A's VMA cache with Y at seqnum 0xffffffff)
A: unmap mapping X (thereby bumping current->mm->vmacache_seqnum to 0)
A: without any more find_vma() calls (which could happen e.g. via pagefaults), create a thread B
B: perform repeated invalidations until current->mm->vmacache_seqnum==0xfffffffe
B: unmap mapping Y (thereby bumping  current->mm->vmacache_seqnum to 0xffffffff)
A: dereference an address in the freed mapping Y (or any address that isn't present in the pagetables and doesn't correspond to a valid VMA cache entry)

This is fixed in 7a9cdebdcc17 (mm: get rid of vmacache_flush_all() entirely), by converting it to a 64-bit counter and not dealing with overflows anymore; which also makes the code simpler and removes rarely-run code in core kernel paths.

So a win-win altogether.

Thanks,
Davidlohr
