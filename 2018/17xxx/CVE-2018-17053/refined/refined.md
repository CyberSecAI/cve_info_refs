  "vulnerabilityDetails": "The vulnerability is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue present in the Identity Server of Progress Sitefinity CMS versions 10.0 through 11.0. This vulnerability is triggered by missing validation of the `redirect_uri` parameter within the authentication process. Specifically, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `redirect_uri` parameter of a GET request. This injected code will then be reflected in the `action` parameter of a form HTML tag, allowing for the execution of arbitrary scripts when a victim visits the crafted URL.",
  "impact": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to inject and execute arbitrary web script or HTML in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or the execution of malicious actions on the user's behalf.",
  "attackVectorDetails": "The attack vector is through a crafted URL that contains the malicious JavaScript within the `redirect_uri` GET parameter. The victim must click the malicious link to trigger the exploit.",
  "attackerRequirements": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload and trick a victim into accessing it. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. A user must click the specially crafted link to trigger the vulnerability."
