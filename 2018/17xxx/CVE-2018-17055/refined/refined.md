  "vulnerability_details": {
    "CVE-2018-17055": {
      "root_cause": "The arbitrary file upload vulnerability was a result of insufficient checks on the uploaded files, specifically related to image uploads. Although the server-side component checks the uploaded image header, it does not validate the file extension appended to the uploaded filename. The file was served back according to the extension.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type (CWE-434)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can upload files of arbitrary types, such as HTML, by manipulating the filename extension, potentially leading to the execution of malicious code on the victim's browser or other unauthorized actions when the file is accessed by a user.",
       "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be exploited by uploading a file, with an image header, but with a malicious extension, such as HTML. The filename extension is not validated during the upload process.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to upload files to the affected system. No specific privilege is required, since the blog post mentions 'the image of the user profile' is vulnerable to this vulnerability, which is usually an option available to all users."
