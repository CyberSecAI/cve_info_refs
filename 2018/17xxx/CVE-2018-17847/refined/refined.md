  "cve": "CVE-2018-17847",
  "description": "The html package (aka x/net/html) through 2018-09-25 in Go mishandles <svg><template><desc><t><svg></template>, leading to a \"panic: runtime error\" (index out of range) in (*nodeStack).pop in node.go, called from (*parser).clearActiveFormattingElements, during an html.Parse call.",
  "affected_versions": [
    "golang-org-x-net-html before 2018-09-25"
   ],
  "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an index out of range error in the `(*nodeStack).pop` function within `node.go` during a call to `html.Parse()`.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Index out of range error in node.go's (*nodeStack).pop function.",
        "Improper handling of certain tag sequences in HTML parsing."
  ],
  "impact": "A crafted HTML input can cause a runtime panic, leading to a denial-of-service.",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "Providing a specific crafted HTML input string to the `html.Parse` function."
  ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to control or influence the HTML input provided to the vulnerable application's `html.Parse` function.",
   "additional_info": "The vulnerability is triggered by a specific sequence of nested HTML tags: `<svg><template><desc><t><svg></template>`. The issue occurs during the parsing process, where the node stack is manipulated improperly, leading to a pop operation on an empty stack."
