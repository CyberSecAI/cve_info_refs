[October 8, 2018](https://insinuator.net/2018/10/vulnerabilities-in-sitefinity-wcms-a-success-story-of-a-responsible-disclosure-process/) by [Ali Hardudi](https://insinuator.net/author/ahardudi/)
# Vulnerabilities in Sitefinity WCMS â€“ A Success Story of a Responsible Disclosure Process

# Preface

For those who never heard of *Sitefinity* before, it is anÂ *ASP.NET*-based Web Content Management System (*WCMS*), whichÂ is used to deploy and manage applications as other *CMS*â€˜s do. A bitter quick glance at *Sitefinity* and its advantages can be found in thisÂ [overview.](https://www.progress.com/documentation/sitefinity-cms/sitefinity-overview)

Delving into the core of this blog post, recently I had the opportunity to look atÂ *Sitefinity WCMS*Â in which I found two *reflected*Â *Cross Site Scripting* (*XSS*) (*[CVE-2018-17053](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2018-17053/ "CVE-2018-17053 security vulnerability details")Â andÂ [CVE-2018-17056](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2018-17056/ "CVE-2018-17056 security vulnerability details")*),Â a*stored XSS* (*[CVE-2018-17054](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2018-17054/ "CVE-2018-17054 security vulnerability details")*) and an arbitrary file upload ([*CVE-2018-17055*](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2018-17055/ "CVE-2018-17055 security vulnerability details")) vulnerabilities.

I admit that the vulnerabilities mentioned in here are classical ones, but because of the huge spectrum of the platform versions affected, I thought it would be helpful to send a loud signal to whomever are usingÂ *Sitefinity,* so they can apply fixes and be safe ðŸ˜‰

# Proof of Concept

The first *reflected XSS* was because of the missing validation for the*GET URL* parameter *redirect\_uri*. The following excerpt of the *HTTP*Â *GET* request shows how the affected parameter was simply injected with client-side code:

```
GET /Sitefinity/Authenticate/OpenID/connect/authorize?client_id=sitefinity&redirect_uri=javascript%3Aalert(%27ERNW%27)&response_mode=form_post&response_type=[...]&scope=[...]&state=[...]&nonce=[...] HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Cookie:idsrv=[...]
Connection: close
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
```

Receiving the previous request resulted in reflecting the *JavaScript URI* as the value of the *action*Â parameter of the *form* *HTML*Â tag. The injection was not only limited to the *JavaScript* *URI*, but also escaping from the *HTML* context was possible using quotes and tags.

The second *reflected XSS*, was in the *REST API* service *URL*, where all the *GET URL* parameters were not validated and echoed back to the client. In fact, the only barrier to make this *XSS* fully exploitable is that the component at the server-side does not do *URL* decoding for the payload. Therefore attacking users with modern browsers that do *URL* encoding is not possible, because the payload will be reflected with *URL*-encoded values, which prevents the payload from being triggered. The following excerpt is an example of an injection point in one of the affectedÂ *GET URL*parameters:

```
GET /restapi/sitefinity/related-data/child-items?ParentItemId=cc42"onmouseover="alert(1)"any="[...]&ParentItemType=[...]&ParentProviderName=[...]&FieldName=[...]&skip=[...]&take=[...]&Status=[...]&ChildItemType=[...]&ChildProviderName=[...]&_=[...] HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
[...]
```

The stored *XSS* on the other side is achieved by injecting a *GET* parameter called *post\_logout\_redirect\_uri*, which is part of the *URL*Â that is sent after the *Sitefinity* user logs out. Upon receiving the request, a *302* *Redirect* to the logout *URL* will be sent back to the client and following the redirection will result in receiving the injected payload. The redirecting link contains a *GET* parameter called *id*, which has a value of 32 hexadecimal digits (probably *MD5*) and this value is a unique for each logout request. The injected payload will be used as the value for the *content* parameter of the *meta HTML*Â tag. The snippets shown below depict the aforementioned information:

```
GET /Sitefinity/Authenticate/OpenID/connect/endsession?post_logout_redirect_uri=javascript%3Aalert(%22ERNW%22)%27%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(%22ERNW%22)%3C%2Fscript%3E%3C%27&id_token_hint=[...] HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
[...]

HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://localhost/Sitefinity/Authenticate/OpenID/logout?id=dfc9e7d06d67b06e5791b7c1add2fb7e
[...]

GET /Sitefinity/Authenticate/OpenID/logout?id=dfc9e7d06d67b06e5791b7c1add2fb7e HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
[...]

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
[...]

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv='refresh' content='javascript:alert("ERNW")'><script>alert("ERNW")</script><''>
</head>
<body></body>
</html>
```

The arbitrary file upload vulnerability was a result of the insufficient checks on the uploaded files e.g. the image of the user profile. Although the server-side component does really check the uploaded image header, however this turned out to be an incomplete measure, because the file was served backÂ according to the extension, which was appended to the uploaded filename and this was not validated by the upload functionality. By abusing the unchecked filename extension, I could upload e.g. an *HTML* file, which started with a piece of a valid *PNG* image and appended some *HTML* at the end of that image. The link for the uploaded file can be sent to any user and directly opened by the browser by removing the *GET URL* parameter *download*Â or set it to *false*. The following image illustrates a successful upload of an *HTML* file:

# Mitigation

All the vulnerabilities can now be mitigated by following the instructions in the [base knowledge article](https://knowledgebase.progress.com/articles/Article/Security-Advisory-for-Resolving-Security-vulnerabilities-September-2018), which was published on 25.09.2018 by *Progress*Â *Sitefinity*.

# Timeline of the Disclosure Process

* On 14.08.2018, Sitefinity Security team was first contacted.
* On 23.08.2018, all the reported vulnerabilities were confirmed by the vendor.
* On 25.09.2018, the vendor released the security fixes.

At the end, I would sincerely like to thank the security team of the *Sitefinity*Â for being very responsive and active to mitigate the reported vulnerabilities. This â€“ in my humble experience â€“ is a live example of a well cooperative vendor, which cares about making the world a safer place.

For you guys, who stepped by and read my post, thanks for your time and I hope you enjoyed it ðŸ™‚

Till the next blog post, be safe and good bye,

Ali Hardudi
