Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-17901

**Vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds Write

**Root Cause:** The application fails to sanitize user input when processing project files before performing write operations on a stack object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787):** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write due to the lack of input sanitization before write operations on a stack object. This can lead to overwriting parts of the stack outside of the intended buffer.
