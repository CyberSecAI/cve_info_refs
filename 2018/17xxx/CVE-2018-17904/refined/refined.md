Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-17904:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the GEOVAP Reliance 4 SCADA/HMI system.
*   The system fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before reflecting it back in HTTP responses.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An unauthenticated attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web application.
*   Successful injection could lead to the execution of malicious code within the user's browser, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a specially crafted HTTP request using an HTTP proxy.
*   The malicious JavaScript code is reflected back in the HTTP response.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited through user interaction, i.e., when a user visits a compromised web page containing the malicious script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system.
*   The attacker does not require authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs a low level of technical skill to craft malicious HTTP requests.

**Additional Information:**

*   The affected product is Reliance SCADA Version 4.7.3 Update 3 and prior.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).
*   The vendor released version 4.8.0 to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   Using HTTPS is recommended as a preventative measure to secure the traffic from manipulation
*   The vulnerability affects Critical Infrastructure Sectors: Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Transportation Systems, and Water and Wastewater Systems.
*   There are no known public exploits targeting this vulnerability.
