## Impact ##

An attacker with physical access can fully compromise the device, by
exploiting the vulnerabilities documented in this advisory. Sensitive
data stored or transmitted via the device might get exposed through
this attack.

We recommend upgrading to version RUT9XX_R_00.04.233 or newer, which
includes fixes for the vulnerability described in this advisory.
It is important to clear all settings during upgrade, for example, by
disabling the "Keep all settings" checkbox while upgrading via the
webinterface. Otherwise, newer firmware versions remain vulnerable.

## Vulnerability Description ##

RUT9XX routers provide a UART/serial interface on two pins of an
internal card-edge connector.

* RX: Pin 1 - Rectangle-like pin on the top-side (CPU side)
* TX: Pin 8 - Rectangle-like pin on the bottom-side

The UART interface uses TTL-level and a baud rate of 115200. It
provides log output and a root terminal without proper access control.

## Proof-of-Concept ##

Our test device with firmware RUT9XX_R_00.04.172 provided the following
log output during boot and after hitting the ENTER key:

# Teltonika RUT9XX Missing Access Control to UART Root Terminal

## Vulnerability Overview

Teltonika RUT9XX routers with firmware before 00.04.233 provide a root
terminal on a serial interface without proper access control. This
allows attackers with physical access to execute arbitrary commands
with root privileges.

* **Identifier** : SBA-ADV-20180319-02
* **Type of Vulnerability** : Incorrect Access Control
* **Software/Product Name** : [Teltonika RUT955](https://teltonika.lt/product/rut955/)
* **Vendor** : [Teltonika](https://teltonika.lt/)
* **Affected Versions** : Firmware RUT9XX\_R\_00.04.199 and probably prior,
  newer firmware versions if settings were not cleared
* **Fixed in Version** : RUT9XX\_R\_00.04.233
* **CVE ID** : CVE-2018-17534
* **CVSSv3 Vector** : CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
* **CVSSv3 Base Score** : 6.8 (Medium)

## Vendor Description

> RUT955 is a highly reliable and secure LTE router with I/O, GNSS and
> RS232/RS485 for professional applications. Router delivers high

## Impact

An attacker with physical access can fully compromise the device, by
exploiting the vulnerabilities documented in this advisory. Sensitive
data stored or transmitted via the device might get exposed through
this attack.

We recommend upgrading to version RUT9XX\_R\_00.04.233 or newer, which
includes fixes for the vulnerability described in this advisory.
It is important to clear all settings during upgrade, for example, by
disabling the "Keep all settings" checkbox while upgrading via the
webinterface. Otherwise, newer firmware versions remain vulnerable.

## Vulnerability Description

RUT9XX routers provide a UART/serial interface on two pins of an
internal card-edge connector.

* RX: Pin 1 - Rectangle-like pin on the top-side (CPU side)
* TX: Pin 8 - Rectangle-like pin on the bottom-side

The UART interface uses TTL-level and a baud rate of 115200. It
provides log output and a root terminal without proper access control.

## Proof-of-Concept

Our test device with firmware RUT9XX\_R\_00.04.172 provided the following
log output during boot and after hitting the ENTER key:

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).
