The provided content pertains to CVE-2018-17534.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Teltonika RUT9XX routers provide a UART/serial interface that provides a root terminal without proper access control.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing Access Control: The serial interface provides a root terminal without requiring any authentication or authorization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Full device compromise: An attacker with physical access can execute arbitrary commands with root privileges, leading to complete control over the device.
- Data exposure: Sensitive data stored or transmitted via the device can be exposed.

**Attack vectors:**
- Physical access: The vulnerability is exploitable via the physical UART/serial interface of the device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Physical access to the device: The attacker needs physical access to the router to connect to the serial interface.
- Ability to connect to the UART pins using TTL-level serial connection at 115200 baud rate.
