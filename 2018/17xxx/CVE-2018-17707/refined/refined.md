Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-17707

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way the Epic Games Launcher handles the `com.epicgames.launcher` protocol. It allows for the execution of a system call composed from a user-supplied string extracted from a crafted URI using the specified protocol.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing system calls, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.
- **Insecure Protocol Handling:** The application's handling of the `com.epicgames.launcher` protocol is vulnerable, as it allows the execution of attacker-controlled commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine with the privileges of the current user. This could lead to a complete compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URI:** The attack is triggered by opening a crafted URI that uses the `com.epicgames.launcher` protocol. This could be achieved by:
  -  Embedding the URI in a malicious web page, which the victim is tricked into visiting.
  - Delivering the URI in a malicious file that the victim opens.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote attacker:** The attacker can be remote and does not need any prior access to the victim's system.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick the victim into visiting a malicious web page or open a malicious file containing the crafted URI.
