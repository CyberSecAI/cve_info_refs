##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

###### Functionality

It seems fully featured, but is hampered by a number of non fatal bugs that make you restart from the component menu.

The rankings are PITA

###### Ease of use

yes. If it weren't for the bugs it'd be 5

###### Support

Untested -

###### Documentation

OK

I used this to:
Still testing. Will probably use it if the bugs are fixed
Owner's reply:
Without mentioning any error, without reporting in forum, without any mail to us you thought it correct to post a bad review for a free component. Wont you think of atleast giving a chance to correct error if any. I was expecting this review as some paid components are getting effected.

I am using this extension since a year almost and I can only recommend it for everyone searching for a free questions-answers component. The support is great, I requested a bug fix for SEF URL's and the team is following up with it promptly. They have placed a huge effort to get this component for us free. Thank you!

Owner's reply:
Thanks a lot for the review. I am a bit late in updating my component in JED as I am busy upgrading it with new functionlities. I am adding a group system where only a particular group can be allowed to answer and view a question. Its almost nearing completion and will be released in the end of mar 14.

The componenente works very well, you can give or take away points depending on the user action, to qualify based on the scores by rewarding the most active users and more functionalities.

In short, allows you to create a complete site type to yahoo answer!

The creators of the component also provide excellent help and advice and are always very kind!

I must say the developer of this component is most helpful find a bug a new version is out same day or the next with the bug fixed. Very good component especially for being such a new one. I have a feeling in the next few weeks this component will be much better than the commercial ones out there right now. Keep up the excellent work. Right now this component is as good as any of the paid ones out there
