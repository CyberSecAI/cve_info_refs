Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-17377

**Vulnerable Software:** Joomla! Component Questions

**Vulnerable Version:** 1.4.3

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The component is vulnerable to SQL Injection due to unsanitized user inputs in the `term`, `userid`, `users`, `groups`, and `group_name` parameters within the component's URL requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection: Improper sanitization of user-supplied inputs allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries into the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach/Exposure:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials, configuration details, and other confidential data.
- **Data Modification:** An attacker might be able to modify or delete data within the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker might be able to gain elevated privileges within the application by creating new user groups or manipulating existing user data.
- **System Compromise:** In severe cases, an attacker might be able to gain complete control of the system if the database user has sufficient privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET requests with specific parameters containing malicious SQL code.
- The vulnerable parameters are:
    - `term` in `index.php?option=com_questions&tmpl=component&task=quazax.getusers`
    - `userid`, `users`, and `groups` in `index.php?option=com_questions&tmpl=component&task=quazax.sendnotification`
    - `group_name` in `index.php?option=com_questions&tmpl=component&task=quazax.addnewgroup`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No authentication is required, the vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated user.
- The attacker must have knowledge of the vulnerable URL parameters and how to craft SQL injection payloads.

**Exploit Examples:**
The provided exploit examples demonstrate various SQL injection techniques, including:
- UNION-based injection
- Time-based injection
- Error-based injection
- Exploitation of MySQL procedures.

The exploit examples showcase that the injection points allow for the retrieval of database information such as user, database, and version information, as well as the ability to count columns and retrieve table names. It also displays how to potentially use procedure calls and inject into group creation features.

**Additional Notes:**
The exploit information from exploit-db provides detailed proof-of-concept URLs and SQL injection payloads.
