Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-17379:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a SQL injection vulnerability in the Joomla! Component Raffle Factory version 3.5.2.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The application is vulnerable to SQL injection. The vulnerability lies in the `filter_order` and `filter_order_Dir` parameters, which are not properly sanitized and allow for the injection of arbitrary SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the backend database. This can lead to:
*   Data Breaches: Accessing, modifying, or deleting sensitive data within the database.
*   Privilege Escalation: Potentially gaining access to administrative accounts or other sensitive parts of the application.
*   Complete System Compromise: In severe cases, the attacker could gain shell access or take over the entire server depending on the database access level and environment.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is accessible through HTTP GET requests by manipulating the `filter_order` and `filter_order_Dir` parameters in the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected Joomla! instance. No specific user privileges are needed, making this vulnerability remotely exploitable.
A successful attack can be performed through the following URL:
```
http://localhost/[PATH]/index.php?task=showSearchResults&option=com_rafflefactory&filter_order_Dir=[SQL]&filter_order=[SQL]
```
Where `[SQL]` represents the malicious SQL injection payload. An example payload is provided in the exploit:
```
%2c%45%58%54%52%41%43%54%56%41%4c%55%45%28%36%36%2c%43%4f%4e%43%41%54%28%30%78%35%63%2c%28%53%45%4c%45%43%54%20%28%45%4c%54%28%36%36%3d%36%36%2c%31%29%29%29%2c%43%4f%4e%43%41%54%5f%57%53%28%30%78%32%30%33%61%32%30%2c%55%53%45%52%28%29%2c%44%41%54%41%42%41%53%45%28%29%2c%56%45%52%53%49%4f%4e%28%29%29%29%29
```
This payload can be URL decoded and then used in the above URL.

The content from extensions.joomla.org indicates that the extension has been unpublished due to "Broken Links", this implies that while the extension may be vulnerable, it may no longer be actively maintained.
