Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in the content related to CVE-2018-17287:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Kofax Front Office Server Administration Console handles sensitive data, specifically password fields. While these fields are obfuscated in the front-end, the backend "download" feature does not properly sanitize the data before outputting it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of sensitive information, specifically passwords, in cleartext via the download feature.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation:** The backend fails to properly sanitize or validate the data before exporting it, leading to the exposure of the cleartext password.
- **Insecure Data Handling:** The application handles sensitive data (passwords) insecurely, by storing and transferring them in a way that allows them to be easily extracted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive information, specifically cleartext passwords, which can lead to unauthorized access to Kofax Front Office Server.
- **Account Compromise:** With access to cleartext passwords, attackers can compromise user accounts, and gain access to the system for malicious activities.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** Exploitation could allow an attacker to move laterally within the network and potentially access further sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the server, targeting the "downloadsettingvalue" endpoint.
- **Specific Parameter Targeting:** The attacker targets specific settings like `mfp.password` using the appropriate parameter in the URL to retrieve the cleartext password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the Kofax Front Office Server.
- **Knowledge of API Endpoints:** The attacker needs to be aware of the specific backend endpoint (`/Kofax/KFS/Admin/SettingsService/settings/customization/downloadsettingvalue/`) and parameters (`mfp.ricoh.properties/mfp.password/`) used to download the cleartext password.
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs a valid session for Kofax Admin (`KFS_AUTH_ADMIN` cookie) in order to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specific to Kofax Front Office Server Administration Console version 4.1.1.11.0.5212
- The provided example clearly demonstrates the vulnerability with both the malicious request and the server response containing the cleartext password.
