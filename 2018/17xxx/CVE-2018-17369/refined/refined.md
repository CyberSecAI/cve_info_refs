Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the reported vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Location:** `admin/role/edit` page in the `springboot_authority` project.
*   **Affected Parameters:** `roleKey`, `name`, and `description` parameters.
*   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input in the `roleKey`, `name`, and `description` fields when editing roles. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into these fields.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker with the ability to edit roles (likely an administrator or someone with elevated privileges) can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `roleKey`, `name`, or `description` fields via the `admin/role/edit` interface.
*   **Impact:** When other users (including administrators) view the edited role, the stored XSS payload will be executed in their browsers. This could lead to:
    *   Account compromise (if an administrator's session is hijacked).
    *   Data theft.
    *   Redirection to malicious websites.
    *   Defacement of the application.
    *   Other malicious activities within the context of the user's session.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Attacker needs to have privileges to access and edit roles via the `admin/role/edit` interface.
*   **More Detail than CVE Description:** Yes, the content provides the vulnerable parameters and the affected page.
