Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-17587:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization of the `productboardtype` parameter in the `top.html` page of the Airties AIR5342 modem.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input provided through the `productboardtype` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable page. When a user visits the crafted URL, the malicious script will execute within the user's browser session, potentially allowing the attacker to:
    *   Steal cookies and session tokens
    *   Hijack the user's session
    *   Redirect the user to malicious websites
    *   Deface the website
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes the malicious JavaScript code within the `productboardtype` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and lure a user into clicking it. This could involve techniques like phishing or embedding the malicious link on a website.
*   The attacker does not require direct access to the modem but relies on a user with access to the modem's web interface to click the malicious link.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable parameter is `productboardtype` in the `/top.html` page.
*   The exploit shows an example of a GET request:
    ```
    GET /top.html?page=main&productboardtype=%3Cscript%3Ealert(%22Ismail%20Tasdelen%22);%3C/script%3E HTTP/1.1
    ```
*   The `%3Cscript%3Ealert(%22Ismail%20Tasdelen%22);%3C/script%3E` is the URL encoded version of `<script>alert("Ismail Tasdelen");</script>`. This payload demonstrates a simple alert box, but an attacker could use more sophisticated JavaScript for malicious purposes.
*  The vulnerability affects multiple AirTies modem models including  AIR5342, AIR5343v2, AIR5443v2, AIR5453, AIR5442, AIR5750, AIR5650, and AIR5021.
