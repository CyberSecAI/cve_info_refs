Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-17956:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how the `yast2-samba-provision` module handles passwords when executing `samba-tool` commands. Specifically, passwords were being passed directly as command-line arguments.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Password Exposure in Process List:** Passwords, including the administrator password (`--adminpass`) and join credentials (`--password`), were included in the command strings used to execute `samba-tool`. This means that these passwords would be visible in the process list (e.g., using `ps` command).
*   **Potential Command Injection:** While not the primary focus, the report also notes a potential for command injection due to the use of `.target.bash_output` or improper quoting of variables used in these commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker with local access to the system could potentially view the process list and extract the exposed passwords. This would allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the Samba domain or perform other malicious activities using the compromised credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The primary attack vector is through local access to the system where `yast2-samba-provision` is being used. An attacker with local access can view the process list and extract passwords.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have local access to the system where the vulnerable `yast2-samba-provision` module is being used, and enough privileges to view the process list.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The bug report mentions that the issue was resolved in version 1.0.2 of `yast2-samba-provision`, which indicates that the vulnerability was patched.
*   The fix likely involved a different method of passing the passwords to `samba-tool`, other than through command-line arguments.
*  The fix was released as part of SUSE-SU-2022:3199-1 update.
