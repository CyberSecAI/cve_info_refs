{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The destructor `CEmuopl::~CEmuopl()` in `emuopl.cpp` calls `OPLDestroy(opl[0])` and `OPLDestroy(opl[1])` in succession. The `OPLDestroy` function, as defined in `fmopl.c`, calls `OPL_UnLockTable` which in turn invokes `OPLCloseTable`. `OPLCloseTable` frees four global pointers: `TL_TABLE`, `SIN_TABLE`, `AMS_TABLE`, and `VIB_TABLE`. Because the `OPLDestroy` function is called twice, it attempts to free the same global pointers twice.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Double-free vulnerability (CWE-415)"
    ],
    "impact": "Double-free vulnerability can lead to application crashes or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when the `CEmuopl` object is destroyed, likely when a music file using the OPL emulation is closed.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to open and close a music file that utilizes the affected OPL emulator."
  },
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs due to the destructor calling `OPLDestroy` twice, leading to a double free of global pointers. The suggested fix is to set the pointers to NULL after freeing them to prevent them from being freed again on subsequent calls."
