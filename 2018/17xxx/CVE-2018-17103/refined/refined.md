- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The GetSimpleCMS v3.3.13 application lacks sufficient Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection when changing the administrator password in `admin/settings.php`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a CSRF vulnerability, allowing an attacker to change the administrator's password by tricking the administrator's browser into submitting a crafted form. The server does not properly validate that the request originated from a legitimate user session.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can change the administrator's password, leading to a complete takeover of the GetSimpleCMS instance, which includes access to all its resources, settings, and data.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a malicious web page (e.g., a link or a compromised website) that, when loaded by an authenticated administrator, submits a crafted POST request to the vulnerable `admin/settings.php` script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to lure an authenticated administrator to a malicious page. The administrator must have an active session on the vulnerable GetSimpleCMS instance. The attacker does not need any direct access to the server.
