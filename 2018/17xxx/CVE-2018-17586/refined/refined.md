The provided content is related to CVE-2018-17586.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `rules[0][content]` parameter when saving timeout pages, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The injected script is saved and executed when the page is accessed, affecting other users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious actions, including session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites, depending on the attacker's goals.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker sends a crafted POST request to `/wordpress498/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `rules[0][content]` parameter containing the malicious script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the affected WordPress site. They do not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable parameter to exploit the vulnerability.
