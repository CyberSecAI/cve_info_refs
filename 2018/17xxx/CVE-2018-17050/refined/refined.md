Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2018-17050:

**Vulnerability Description:**

The core issue is an integer overflow vulnerability within the `mintToken` function of the PolyAi smart contract. This function allows the contract owner to mint new tokens to any address. The vulnerability arises because the `balanceOf` mapping is not checked to prevent an overflow of the balance.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause lies in the lack of overflow protection within the `mintToken` function. The function directly adds the `mintedAmount` to the target address's balance using the `+=` operator without checking if the result would exceed the maximum value for the `uint256` type.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The `balanceOf[target] += mintedAmount;` statement is vulnerable to integer overflow if `mintedAmount` is large enough and the existing balance is close to the maximum value.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Token Value Manipulation:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can effectively "reset" a target user's token balance to zero and make it extremely large in a second call to mintToken, or manipulate it to a desired value. This is because an overflow will cause the token balance to wrap around to a small value and it is not always possible to reset this value to an expected one, meaning it can be used to block transactions.
*   **Denial of Service:** It will make the contract unreliable by making the token value unreliable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Function Call:** The attack vector is a call to the `mintToken` function by the contract owner.
*   **Input Manipulation:** The attacker must provide a large `mintedAmount` value in the call to `mintToken` to trigger the overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Contract Owner Access:** The attacker needs to be the owner of the smart contract or compromise the owner account.
*   **Arbitrary Minting:** The attacker must have the ability to call the `mintToken` function.

**Technical Details:**

*   The `mintToken` function in the PolyAi contract is as follows:
    ```
    function mintToken(address target, uint256 mintedAmount) onlyOwner {
            balanceOf[target] += mintedAmount;
            Transfer(0, owner, mintedAmount);
            Transfer(owner, target, mintedAmount);
        }
    ```
*   The `balanceOf` mapping stores token balances as `uint256`, which has a maximum value of 2^256 - 1.

**Exploit Scenario:**

1.  The contract owner calls `mintToken(target_address, 10)`. The `target_address` will have a balance of 10.
2.  The contract owner calls `mintToken(target_address, 2^256 - 10)`. This will cause an overflow where the `balanceOf[target]` will wrap to zero.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content also points out that the `totalSupply` is not updated in the `mintToken` function for the PolyAi contract, which is another inconsistency that can be exploited for additional attacks.
*   The Substratum and BitAseanToken contracts also have the same integer overflow vulnerability in their `mintToken` function and this one includes the update to the `totalSupply`.
