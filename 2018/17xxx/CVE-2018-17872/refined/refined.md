Based on the provided content, here's the information related to CVE-2018-17872:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper access control in the Verint Verba Collaboration Compliance and Quality Management Platform. Specifically, the "Investigator" role checkbox is disabled by default in the "Group Configuration - Assign Users" page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The system does not properly restrict access to modify user roles.
- **Client-side manipulation:** The application relies on client-side controls for role management, which can be easily bypassed by manipulating the HTML source code using browser developer tools.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** By enabling the "Investigator" role for a user, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to additional functionalities, such as viewing "four-eyes-requests" through a new workflow tab. This can enable the user to potentially access and play calls of other users, which they are not supposed to access.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Client-side manipulation:** An attacker with access to the web interface can use browser developer tools (e.g., in Internet Explorer 11 using F12) to modify the HTML source code, specifically enabling and activating the disabled "Investigator" checkbox.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to the Verint Verba web interface.
- Ability to use browser developer tools to modify HTML source code.
- Basic understanding of web page structure to identify and manipulate the relevant checkbox element.

**Additional notes:**
- The affected version is Verint Verba Collaboration Compliance and Quality Management Platform version 9.1.1.5482 and earlier.
- A patch was released by the vendor on 2018-08-31 to address this issue.
