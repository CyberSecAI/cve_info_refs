Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-17871:

**Root Cause:**
- The server delivers passwords in plaintext even though they are obfuscated with dots in the user interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The application does not properly restrict access to sensitive information, specifically passwords.
- **Plaintext Storage:** Although obfuscated in the UI, the passwords are transmitted in plaintext, allowing them to be easily read when inspecting network traffic or manipulating the HTML source.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exposure of sensitive credentials such as:
    - "Key File Password" (server certificate)
    - "Database Password" (SQL Server)
- Unauthorized access to the system and database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Client-side manipulation:** A logged-in user can view plaintext passwords by modifying the HTML source code of the "Change Configuration Settings" page in their browser. This involves changing the `type='password'` attribute to `type='edit'` for password fields.
- A malicious actor may also be able to intercept these credentials during network transmission since they are sent in plaintext.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attacker must have a valid user account with access to the "Change Configuration Settings" page.
- Attacker needs the ability to inspect and modify HTML source code using browser developer tools.
