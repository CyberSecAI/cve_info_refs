- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to improper authentication, allowing an attacker to bypass the user authentication mechanism.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper Authentication (CWE-287).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read sensitive configuration files, which may lead to code execution on the device.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack can be carried out from an adjacent network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on an adjacent network and requires low skill level to exploit.
