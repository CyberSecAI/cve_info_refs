Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of `sscanf` in the `svgStringToLength` function without proper bounds checking when reading the unit string.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The `sscanf` function, when used with the `%s` format specifier, reads characters into the provided buffer (in this case, `szUnit`) until it encounters whitespace. If the input string `szValue` contains a very long sequence of non-whitespace characters after the floating-point number, it can write beyond the bounds of the `szUnit` buffer (which is 8 bytes) on the stack, leading to a stack buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The issue description states that when this library is used to parse SVG files in a browser, a successful stack buffer overflow can potentially lead to remote code execution. The attacker can overwrite parts of the stack with malicious data, allowing them to hijack the control flow and execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious SVG Input:** The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted SVG file that contains an SVG length value with a very long string for the unit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to provide an SVG file:** The attacker needs the ability to provide an SVG file to an application using the vulnerable `libsvg2` library, which processes the file. This is typically possible through uploading or having a vulnerable webpage render a malicious SVG file.

**Additional Details from Content:**
- The provided code snippet shows that the `szUnit` buffer is only 8 bytes long.
- The proof-of-concept (POC) and exploit (EXP) links are provided, suggesting that the vulnerability is exploitable.
- The description highlights that the vulnerability can lead to RCE, implying the severity of the issue.
