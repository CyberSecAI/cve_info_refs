Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-17585:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization within the WP Fastest Cache plugin's admin settings page. Specifically, the `wpFastestCachePreload_number` and `wpFastestCacheLanguage` parameters are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the vulnerable parameters. This code gets stored in the database and is executed when an admin user views the affected settings page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of an administrator's session. This could lead to:
    - Account takeover: Stealing admin cookies or credentials.
    - Defacement: Modifying website content.
    - Redirection: Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Malicious actions: Performing administrative actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wpfastestcacheoptions` endpoint.
- The POST request includes crafted values for `wpFastestCachePreload_number` and `wpFastestCacheLanguage` parameters containing JavaScript payloads within these fields.
- When an administrator visits the plugin options page, the stored XSS payloads are executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the WordPress admin panel.
- The attacker does not require a specific user account to exploit, as it leverages the admin panel settings page.
- This attack requires an administrator to visit the vulnerable page for the javascript to execute.

**Additional Details:**
- The specific vulnerable parameters are:
    - `wpFastestCachePreload_number`
    - `wpFastestCacheLanguage`
- The provided exploit request examples demonstrate how to inject JavaScript using the POST request.
