I’m been using the free version on a couple of websites and this plug-in is great. The setup is easy to follow and the optimization works very well. It definitely speeds up the website. I decided to go with the premium version. The extra options are nice and I have to say Support is fantastic. Both easy to work with a quick with their responses.
Both the plug-in and support has been really great for me. I highly recommend them.

wooocommerce e-ticaret sitemizin sayfa yüklenmesi oldukça uzun sürüyordu. Hosting optimizsayonu sonrasında wordpress optimizasyon kısmında 10 civarı ön bellek uygulamasını denedik. WP Fastest Cache menüsünde çok fazla seçenek olmasına karşın önerilen ayarlar ile %55-60 civarı bir performans katkısı sağlıyor. %90 ve üzeri etkili önbellek ve hız isteyenler için hayal kırıklığı olacaktır bu eklenti. Geliştiricinin uygulamayı güçlendirmesi gerektiğini düşünüyorum, bu hali ile tavsiye edilmez.
