```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The CMS does not perform security filtering on the 'oldimg' parameter value in the `/user/zssave.php` file, allowing an attacker to specify an arbitrary file path for deletion.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient input validation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can delete any file accessible by the web server user, leading to potential data loss or system instability.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious POST request to `/user/zssave.php` with a crafted 'oldimg' parameter specifying the path of the file to be deleted.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be logged in to access the `/user/zssave.php` page. They must also know the path to the file they want to delete, or be able to guess it. The attacker also needs to craft the request to include the `oldimg` parameter."
