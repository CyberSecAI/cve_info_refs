    "related_to_CVE": true,
    "CVE_ID": "CVE-2018-17691",
    "summary": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Foxit PhantomPDF. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the conversion of HTML files to PDF. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the lack of validation for the existence of an object before operations are performed on it during the conversion of HTML files to PDF.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process running Foxit PhantomPDF.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Visiting a malicious web page",
      "Opening a malicious HTML file"
    ],
     "required_capabilities": [
      "The attacker needs to craft a malicious HTML file or a web page. User interaction such as opening the malicious file or visiting a malicious webpage is required"
