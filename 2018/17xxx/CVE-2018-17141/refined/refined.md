  "CVE-2018-17141": {
    "description": "Multiple bugs were found in the code handling fax page reception in JPEG format that allow arbitrary writes to an uninitialized pointer by remote parties dialing in. When processing an specially crafted input, the issue could lead to remote code execution.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from missing input sanitization within the HylaFAX software when handling JPEG formatted fax page receptions, leading to an uninitialized pointer write, and out-of-bounds write.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Uninitialized pointer write: The `recvRow` pointer is not always initialized before being used in a memcpy operation. Specifically, the `recvRow` is initialized only when `params.jp` is `JP_GREY` or `JP_COLOR` and `params.df` is exactly zero. However, a later `memcpy` uses the `recvRow` when `params.jp` is `JP_GREY` or `JP_COLOR` regardless of `params.df`, potentially writing to uninitialized memory.",
       "Out-of-bounds write in `FaxModem::writeECMData()`: The `memcpy` operation lacks bounds checks before writing to `recvRow`, allowing an attacker to write beyond the allocated memory.",
      "Out-of-bounds write in `FaxModem::recvPageDLEData()`: Another unbounded `memcpy` operation is present, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds write. However, this issue might not be reachable under normal circumstances because the JPEG flag forces ECM reception."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution is possible by sending specially crafted fax messages.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is an incoming fax call where a remote party crafts a malicious fax message with a specific DCS signal, which results in an uninitialized pointer being used as a target for `memcpy` or by causing an out of bounds write when writing to the recvRow buffer.",
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker must be able to send fax messages to the vulnerable HylaFAX server. This means they need access to a fax line/device and the ability to manipulate fax data/signals."
