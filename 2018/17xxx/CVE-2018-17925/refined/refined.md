Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an unsafe ActiveX control, specifically a Gigasoft component, being marked as "Safe for Scripting". This allows scripts to interact with the component, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Unsafe ActiveX Control:** The core weakness is the use of an ActiveX control that has not been properly secured.
*   **Marked Safe for Scripting:** The control being marked as "Safe for Scripting" makes it accessible for scripting languages, increasing attack surface.
*   **Buffer Overflow:** Exploitation of the vulnerability could lead to a buffer overflow condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in:
*   **Buffer Overflow:** Leading to potential crash or arbitrary code execution.
*   **Data manipulation:** As the control is part of the Gigasoft charting package, successful exploitation may allow manipulation of displayed data.
*   **Possible compromise of HMI system:** Since iFIX HMI products are affected, this could compromise the Human Machine Interface.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The advisory states that the vulnerability is remotely exploitable, though it requires low skill level.
*   **ActiveX control interaction:** The attack vector involves interaction with the vulnerable ActiveX control through scripts.
*   **Potentially through malicious web content:** Although not explicitly stated in the provided content, the mention of impact on Internet Explorer suggests that a specially crafted webpage could host malicious content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have some form of network access to the system running the vulnerable software.
*   **Low Skill Level:** The advisory indicates that the exploitation of the vulnerability requires a low skill level, suggesting that the attack is relatively easy to carry out.
*   **Ability to interact with the ActiveX control:** The attacker needs to be able to execute scripts that interact with the unsafe ActiveX control, which may be achieved through a malicious webpage or other delivery mechanism.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in the Gigasoft component used by GE iFIX.
*   The specific method impacting Internet Explorer may not be directly exposed in the iFIX product, however the core functionality of the iFIX product may be impacted.
*   The fix involves upgrading to Gigasoft Version 8.0.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2018-17925 and has a CVSS v3 base score of 5.3.
*   No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability but it is remotely exploitable with low skill level.
