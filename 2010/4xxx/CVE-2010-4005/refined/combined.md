| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=644606#c0)  Vincent Danen    2010-10-19 20:16:11 UTC  ``` Ludwig Nussel discovered that tomboy contained a script that could be abused by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.  The vulnerability is due to an insecure change to LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and environment variable used by ld.so(8) to look for libraries in directories other than the standard paths.  When there is an empty item in the colon-separated list of directories in LD_LIBRARY_PATH, ld.so(8) treats it as a '.' (current working directory).  If the given script is executed from a directory where a local attacker could write files, there is a chance for exploitation.  In Fedora, both /usr/bin/tomboy and /usr/bin/tomboy-panel re-set LD_LIBRARY_PATH insecurely:  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/lib/tomboy${LD_LIBRARY_PATH+:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH}"  A solution is to patch the script to use ':+:' properly:  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/foo${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH}   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=644606#c1)  Vincent Danen    2010-10-20 16:39:37 UTC  ``` Created tomboy tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 644956](show_bug.cgi?id=644956 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-4005 tomboy: insecure library loading vulnerability [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=644606#c2)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-06-10 10:57:24 UTC  ``` This CVE Bugzilla entry is for community support informational purposes only as it does not affect a package in a commercially supported Red Hat product.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- libxml2
Specially crafted xml documents could crash applications linked
against libxml2 (CVE-2010-4008).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- tomboy
The tomboy startup scripts put empty elements in LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH
causing tomboy to load shared libraries from the current directory
(CVE-2010-4005).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3
- krb5
krb5 did no properly check messages. Remote attackers could exploit
that to modify or forge messages
(CVE-2010-1323, CVE-2010-1324, CVE-2010-4020, CVE-2010-4021)
Affected Products: SLE11, SLE11-SP1
- php5
Insufficient handling of certain character sequences in the
utf8\_decode() function could be leveraged to conduct
cross-site-scripting (XSS) attacks (CVE-2010-3870).
php5 could also consume large amounts of memory and crash if a long
mail address was passed to filter\_var() with parmeter
FILTER\_VALIDATE\_EMAIL (CVE-2010-3710).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- cups
- CVE-2010-3702: Specially crafted PDF files could crash pdftops or
potentially even cause execution of arbitrary code.
- CVE-2010-2941: Specially crafted IPP requests could crash cupsd
- CVE-2010-0542: A NULL pointer dereference in the \_WriteProlog()
function of the texttops image filter.
- CVE-2010-1748: An attacker with access to the web-interface may be
able to read some bytes of uninitialized memory.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- java-1\_6\_0-openjdk
Untrusted applets could read values of restricted system properties
(CVE-2010-3860).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- epiphany
Epiphany does not support verification of ssl certificates. It
nevertheless displayed all https connections as secure
(CVE-2010-3312).
Affected Products: SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2
- encfs
- CVE-2010-3073: encfs only used 32bits for the IV
- CVE-2010-3074: encfs was prone to a watermarking attack
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
