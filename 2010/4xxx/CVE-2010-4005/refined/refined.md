Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-4005:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an insecure way the `tomboy` startup scripts set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable. Specifically, the scripts included an empty element in the colon-separated list of directories within `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. This empty element is interpreted by `ld.so(8)` as the current working directory (`.`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Insecure Library Loading:** The vulnerability lies in the fact that `tomboy` scripts modify `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` by prepending `/usr/lib/tomboy` to it without properly handling existing values. This insecure modification allows an attacker to inject malicious libraries.
-   **Current Working Directory in Library Path:** The most critical weakness is the inclusion of an empty element in the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` effectively adding the current working directory to the library search path. This is insecure as it allows loading arbitrary libraries from the directory where the script is executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could place a malicious library (e.g., a `.so` file) in a directory and then execute the `tomboy` or `tomboy-panel` scripts from that directory. Since the current directory is in the library path, the system would load and execute the attacker's malicious library, leading to arbitrary code execution.
-   **Local Privilege Escalation (potentially):** If an attacker can get the `tomboy` or `tomboy-panel` scripts executed with higher privileges, this could lead to local privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Local Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable by a local attacker who has the ability to write files in a directory and then execute the affected `tomboy` or `tomboy-panel` scripts from that same directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **File Write Access:** The attacker needs to be able to write files into a directory.
-   **Script Execution:** The attacker must be able to execute either the `tomboy` or `tomboy-panel` scripts from the same directory where they placed their malicious library.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code snippet from the bug report is:

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/lib/tomboy${LD_LIBRARY_PATH+:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH}"
```

This line prepends `/usr/lib/tomboy` to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. If `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is not set, then the `+:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` expands to empty. If `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is already set, it prepends `:/usr/lib/tomboy:` to the existing value.  If `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is already set, it can potentially create an empty element by prepending `:/usr/lib/tomboy:` which evaluates to `:/usr/lib/tomboy::` if LD_LIBRARY_PATH was already empty. The fix is to ensure that the colon is correctly prepended only if LD_LIBRARY_PATH is already set.

The corrected code should look like this:

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/foo${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
```

**Affected Products:**

The vulnerability affected:

-   openSUSE 11.3
-   Fedora (all versions)

**Additional Notes:**

-   The provided content includes information from Red Hat, Mandriva, and openSUSE, but the vulnerability is primarily related to the `tomboy` application and its startup scripts.
-   The openSUSE security report (SUSE-SR:2010:023) lists CVE-2010-4005 as affecting `tomboy` and notes that the issue is with the startup scripts.
-   The Red Hat Bugzilla entry confirms the issue and states that it is due to insecure library loading.

In summary, CVE-2010-4005 is a local privilege escalation vulnerability stemming from an insecure modification of the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable in the `tomboy` application's startup scripts, which allows loading malicious shared libraries from the current working directory.
