[Vanilla 2.0.10 has been released!](http://vanillaforums.org)
### v2.0.10 Changes

1. Fixed plugin autoloader issues that sometimes produced fatal errors during bootstrap
2. Added new routing HTTP response codes
3. Allow .htaccess check to be skipped during installation for hosts that prevent such files
4. Added SafeStyles configuration to prevent XSS linkjacking
5. Patched potential linkbait vulnerability in dispatcher
6. Patched email formatting - thanks ithcy!

### Troubleshooting the Vanilla 2 Installation

If you run into any issues during the installation, you may see the "Bonk" error screen. In order to get past this screen, you can remove the following line from your conf/config.php file:
`$Configuration['Garden']['Errors']['MasterView'] = 'error.master.php';`

This will show you a more detailed screen of information about the actual problem you've encountered. Please include this information when reporting issues (copy & paste exact errors, please).
### Upgrading Vanilla 2.0 Forums

1. Sign into your existing forum with the user that was created when you FIRST INSTALLED Vanilla (the root admin user)
2. Back up your database.
3. Back up all of your existing files.
4. Unarchive the new files and copy them over your existing files. **Make sure that your hidden files (ie .htaccess) are copied to your server.**
5. Make sure the conf/config.php from your old version has been copied over to the new version.
6. Delete all \*.ini files in your cache/ folder
7. Navigate to the page in your forum that updates your database (this will not work if you did not sign in as UserID = 1): www.yourforum.com/utility/structure
8. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the button to run the update scripts.
9. Navigate to your forum and test away!

For more help with upgrading, check out the [Upgrading Tips and Tricks](http://www.vanillaforums.org/discussion/12740/vanilla-2-upgrading-tips) thread.

  I'm getting fatal errors when I switch themes, but not with all themes.
  Logged in github with error trace/trackback

  Also I notice in conf/config.php
  2 version strings are unchanged - should they have been automaticlly updated to 2.0.10 when the file gets updated ?

  $Configuration['Garden']['Version'] = '2.0.9';

  $Configuration['Vanilla']['Version'] = '2.0.9';

  Config versions are not automatically updated and are there for future use.
