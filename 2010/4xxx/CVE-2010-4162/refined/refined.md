  "CVE-2010-4162": {
    "description": "Due to integer underflow and overflow issues when determining the number of pages required for maliciously crafted I/O requests, a local user could send a device ioctl that results in the sequential allocation of a very large number of pages, causing the OOM killer to be invoked and crashing the system.",
    "root_cause": "Integer underflow and overflow issues when calculating the number of pages needed for I/O requests.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Integer underflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Local Denial of Service by triggering the Out-of-Memory (OOM) killer which crashes the system.",
    "attack_vector": "A local user sends a maliciously crafted I/O request via a device ioctl.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Local user with the ability to send ioctls to a block device (typically possible for users in the 'cdrom' group or similar)."
