How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

VMware Security Advisory Advisory ID:VMSA-2010-0020.1VMware Security Advisory Synopsis:VMware ESXi 4.1 Update Installer SFCB Authentication FlawVMware Security Advisory Issue date:2010-12-21VMware Security Advisory Updated on:2012-02-10VMware Security Advisory CVE numbers:CVE-2010-4573

#####

##### 1. Summary

VMware ESXi 4.1 Update Installer might introduce a SFCB Authentication Flaw.

##### 2. Relevant releases

VMware ESXi 4.1 if upgraded from ESXi 3.5 or ESXi 4.0 with a modified SFCB configuration file, without patch ESXi410-201101201-SG.

##### 3. Problem Description

a. ESXi 4.1 Update Installer SFCB Authentication Flaw

Under certain conditions, the ESXi 4.1 installer that upgrades an ESXi 3.5 or ESXi 4.0 host to ESXi 4.1 incorrectly handles the SFCB authentication mode. The result is that SFCB authentication could allow login with any username and password combination.
An ESXi 4.1 host is affected if all of the following apply:
- ESXi 4.1 was upgraded from ESXi 3.5 or ESXi 4.0.
- The SFCB configuration file /etc/sfcb/sfcb.cfg was modified prior to the upgrade.
- The sfcbd daemon is running (sfcbd runs by default).
Workaround
A workaround that can be applied to ESXi 4.1 is described in VMware Knowledge Base Article KB 1031761
