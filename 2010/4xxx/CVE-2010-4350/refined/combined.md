# MantisBT 1.2.4 Released

Howdy all,

MantisBT 1.2.4 is a security update for the stable 1.2.x branch. All installations that are currently running any 1.2.x version are advised to upgrade to this release.

Gjoko Krstic of Zero Science Lab reported multiple vulnerabilities in the admin/upgrade\_unattended.php script. Issue #12607 provides more detail on the vulnerabilities discovered. We thank Gjoko for his detailed assistance with testing, patching and answering questions. Please note that the /admin/ directory should be removed from all MantisBT installations after the installation or upgrade has been completed. This is particularly true for MantisBT installations accessible over the Internet.

Also included with 1.2.4 are some bug fixes relating to fonts in the MantisGraph plugin, SOAP API, CSV export, custom field values, relationship graphs, fields on the manage user page, built-in time tracking and the allow\_reporter\_close feature. This release includes updated translations for many languages and improved installation documentation in doc/INSTALL.

A full changelog for the 1.2.x series can be found on the official site:

<http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/changelog_page.php?version_id=112>

The release is available for download at:

<http://www.mantisbt.org/download.php>

Cheers

   Why don’t you provide the ability to upgrade using patch files instead of recommending a delete/replace procedure?

   It’s as simple as creating a patch file: `git diff release-1.2.3..release-1.2.4 > mantis-1.2.3-to-1.2.4.patch`, and providing this file available for download: <https://gist.github.com/741968>

   Forgot to mention: you can then update your Mantis installation through a simple command: `patch -p0 < mantis-1.2.3-to-1.2.4.patch`. Much handier.

   @Wim: I don’t believe that would work on a Windows installation without also installing GIT. And would make another piece of unrelated software required to patch, which would be a little difficult.

   Don’t get me wrong, i wish they would release an incremental update zip as well. For those cases where i have customizations in files that weren’t updated. In the current process i have to always check to make sure the customizations don’t get overwritten.

    Hi,

    I currenly have 1.1.2 version. I would like to upgrade 1.2.4 version but I have seen there’s lots of changes in the code as in the database structure. Is there any way to update my database for it to adapt to the new structure without lose information. Thanks for your help.

    @Styven Logout, backup code, attachments, database, and config, update code from latest version, go to the site and it will tell you on the login page that your schema is out of date, click and it will upgrade it for you.

    Vboctor, i already tryed all the upgrading steps from the managed module, it adds me the tables in the database that I need and I also adjust the data type of the fields that I need, but the tables and fields with no data leaves me with no data I’m always going to get errors query. I see that the dates camp there no longer datetime but int but when its upgrades doesn’t do the conversion, and also some problems with the category because now its handels on a separate table. If somebody had done a correct upgrade of a 1.1.x to an 1.2x version, i would be so thankful if you can help me. thanks for your information vboctor.

    @Mark Hosang: Any serious server environment has the patch command installed. Patch files, in combination with version control, are the only sane system to update software. Deleting old code + unzipping new code is archaic, error prone and not as easily reversible in case the update breaks something.

| Summary | 0012607: LFI/FD and XSS in the 'upgrade\_unattended.php' | | | | |
| Description | Thanks for responding so quickly. It's about LFI/FD and XSS in the 'upgrade\_unattended.php' script thru "db\_type" parameter.  XSS: http://[MANTIS\_ROOT\_HOST]/admin/upgrade\_unattended.php?db\_type=%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C/script%3E  LFI: http://[MANTIS\_ROOT\_HOST]/admin/upgrade\_unattended.php?db\_type=..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fboot.ini%00  PATH DISCLOSURE: http://[MANTIS\_ROOT\_HOST]/admin/upgrade\_unattended.php?db\_type=%27  The date is added as a vendor contact date. I'm expecting you to verify the issues and acknowledge/credit Zero Science Lab for these findings. After confirmation, scheduled patch release date is expected.  Thank you and best regards,  Gjoko Krstic Information Security Engineer  Zero Science Lab Macedonian Information Security Research & Development Laboratory <http://www.zeroscience.mk> | | | | |

Gialuca mentioned to me on IRC that it may have originally been targeted towards upgrades from PHP CLI (for distribution package management scripts). This seems highly unlikely to work given that this script calls gpc\_ functions that will not work in CLI mode ($\_POST and $\_GET are undefined). However I think his guess may have been close because this script returns plaintext output as opposed to HTML.  If there is no longer a legitimate use for this script, can we remove it entirely? |

Looking at the source code the most likely issue is with ADOdb itself. The version of ADOdb shipped with MantisBT 1.2.3 and 1.3.x will take the user supplied "db\_type" parameter and place it directly in the following string:  /library/adodb/drivers/adodb-${db\_type}.inc.php  Directory traversal shouldn't be possible because the directory starting "adodb-" won't match a directory (only a file, at best).  XSS shouldn't be an issue for most browsers as the page is returned as plaintext (not HTML). I imagine this is still an issue in Internet Explorer where MIME type sniffing is performed by default (and could treat the page as HTML instead of plaintext).  I have confirmed the path disclosure issue (fixed in Victor's patches). |

I suspect Internet Explorer (all versions) is also affected because of the MIME type sniffing that goes on. |

I also updated Victor's patch to be a little bit more pedantic. For instance, returning the text/plain MIME type instead of text/html. And whitelisting certain characters [a-zA-Z0-9\_] for db\_type as opposed to using string\_attribute (which is a bit looser).  I think this is well and truly fixed now :) |

I think the LFI depends on the web server being used as it is reproducible on Apache but I haven't had success with nginx. The XSS will generally work in every browser however Firefox 4.0b8pre has stricter MIME type handling and doesn't seem to be affected. The PD is reproducible everywhere.  1.2.4 is ready to be packaged and released.  Advisories have been written by Gjoko Krstic and are also ready for release.  I am on standby to report these bugs to Debian, Redhat, Gentoo, Ubuntu, Fedora, etc. Only Gentoo uses MantisBT 1.2.x so I'll make sure I send the 1.1.x patch to the other distros. |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c0)  David Hicks    2010-12-15 03:19:40 UTC  ``` The MantisBT project was notified by Gjoko Krstic of Zero Science Lab (gjoko) of multiple vulnerabilities affecting MantisBT <1.2.4.  The two following advisories have been released explaining the vulnerabilities in greater detail:  <http://www.zeroscience.mk/en/vulnerabilities/ZSL-2010-4983.php> <http://www.zeroscience.mk/en/vulnerabilities/ZSL-2010-4984.php>  As one of these vulnerabilities allows the reading of arbitrary files from the file system we are treating this issue with critical severity. Please note that this issue only affects users who have not removed the "admin" directory from their MantisBT installation. We recommend, instruct and warn users to remove this directory after installation however it is clear that many users ignore these warnings.  I have requested CVE numbers via oss-sec (awaiting list moderation).  As Redhat is using MantisBT 1.1.x you will need to apply the following patch to resolve the issue in this older version of MantisBT: <http://git.mantisbt.org/?p=mantisbt.git;a=commitdiff_plain;h=2641fdc60d2032ae1586338d6416e1eadabd7590>  We have also released MantisBT 1.2.4 which resolves the issue for users of our stable 1.2.x branch.  The bug report tracking this issue upstream at MantisBT: <http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=12607>  If there are any questions or concerns please feel free to contact me.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-12-15 10:20:31 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c0)) Hi David,    thank you for such a complete report.  >  > I have requested CVE numbers via oss-sec (awaiting list moderation).    Looks like the CVE identifiers request did not made it to oss-security yet.  To Gianluca: We will update this bug with CVE identifiers later, once they are assigned to the issues. Could you please schedule Fedora MantisBT updates with the patch below? (Fedora bug will follow shortly)  >  > As Redhat is using MantisBT 1.1.x you will need to apply the following > patch to resolve the issue in this older version of MantisBT: > <http://git.mantisbt.org/?p=mantisbt.git;a=commitdiff_plain;h=2641fdc60d2032ae1586338d6416e1eadabd7590>  Thanks && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-12-15 10:23:55 UTC  ``` These issues affect the versions of the mantis package, as shipped with Fedora release of 13 and 14.  These issues affect the version of the mantis package, as present within EPEL-5 repository.  Please schedule an update (patch is above).   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-12-15 10:27:47 UTC  ``` Public PoCs (from <http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=12607>):  1), cross-site scripting (XSS):     http://[mantis_root_host]/admin/upgrade_unattended.php?db_type=%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C/script%3E  2), local file inclusion (LFI):     http://[mantis_root_host]/admin/upgrade_unattended.php?db_type=..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fboot.ini%00  3), path disclosure (PD):     http://[mantis_root_host]/admin/upgrade_unattended.php?db_type=%27   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-12-15 10:30:51 UTC  ``` Created mantis tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 663299](show_bug.cgi?id=663299 "CLOSED ERRATA - MantisBT <1.2.4 multiple vulnerabilities (LFI, XSS and PD) [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c5)  Gianluca Sforna    2010-12-15 10:37:54 UTC  ``` I guess it's relevant to note the default apache configuration provided with the mantis package includes the following.   # Admin directory access is disabled by default; do not change this unless # you are performing the first installation or a database schema update. # See README.Fedora for more details <Directory /usr/share/mantis/admin> 	Order   Deny,Allow 	Deny    from All 	Allow   from None </Directory>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c6)  David Hicks    2010-12-15 10:53:56 UTC  ``` Thanks Jan & Gianluca.  Debian (and by extension Ubuntu) use the same Apache configuration to help protect the /admin/ directory. As a result they have decided that the severity of the bug is not as high as first anticipated by upstream.  I guess it comes down to whether a typical user of this package will keep the /admin/ directory permissions in a locked down state.  This issue is more of a concern for Gentoo (and MantisBT users using the upstream package) where the /admin/ directory permissions are not in place.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c7)  David Hicks    2010-12-16 14:11:13 UTC  ``` From Josh Bressers (oss-sec mailing list):  CVE-2010-4348: Cross site scripting CVE-2010-4349: Path disclosure CVE-2010-4350: Local file inclusion   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c8)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-12-16 14:38:52 UTC  ``` Gianluca, David, thank you for the comments: [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c5](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c5 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-4348 CVE-2010-4349 CVE-2010-4350 MantisBT <1.2.4 multiple vulnerabilities (LFI, XSS and PD)") [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c6](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c6 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-4348 CVE-2010-4349 CVE-2010-4350 MantisBT <1.2.4 multiple vulnerabilities (LFI, XSS and PD)")  (In reply to [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c5)) > I guess it's relevant to note the default apache configuration provided with > the mantis package includes the following. >  >  > # Admin directory access is disabled by default; do not change this unless > # you are performing the first installation or a database schema update. > # See README.Fedora for more details  Based on the above comments decreased severity of the issues to moderate. But we should still address them (to sanitize / protect also not so likely configurations).   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c9)  Gianluca Sforna    2011-02-21 23:23:55 UTC  ``` This was fixed in 1.1.8-5   ``` |  |

#### MantisBT <=1.2.3 (db\_type) Local File Inclusion Vulnerability

Title: MantisBT <=1.2.3 (db\_type) Local File Inclusion Vulnerability

Advisory ID: [ZSL-2010-4984](ZSL-2010-4984.php)

Type: Local

Impact: System Access, Exposure of System Information, Exposure of Sensitive Information

Risk: (4/5)

Release Date: 15.12.2010
##### Summary

MantisBT is a free popular web-based bugtracking system. It is written in the PHP
scripting language and works with MySQL, MS SQL, and PostgreSQL databases and a webserver.
MantisBT has been installed on Windows, Linux, Mac OS, OS/2, and others. Almost any web
browser should be able to function as a client. It is released under the terms of the GNU
General Public License (GPL).
##### Description

Mantis Bug Tracker suffers from a local file inlcusion/disclosure (LFI/FD) vulnerability
when input passed thru the "db\_type" parameter (GET & POST) to upgrade\_unattended.php script is
not properly verified before being used to include files. This can be exploited to include files
from local resources with directory traversal attacks and URL encoded NULL bytes.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c0)  David Hicks    2010-12-15 03:19:40 UTC  ``` The MantisBT project was notified by Gjoko Krstic of Zero Science Lab (gjoko) of multiple vulnerabilities affecting MantisBT <1.2.4.  The two following advisories have been released explaining the vulnerabilities in greater detail:  <http://www.zeroscience.mk/en/vulnerabilities/ZSL-2010-4983.php> <http://www.zeroscience.mk/en/vulnerabilities/ZSL-2010-4984.php>  As one of these vulnerabilities allows the reading of arbitrary files from the file system we are treating this issue with critical severity. Please note that this issue only affects users who have not removed the "admin" directory from their MantisBT installation. We recommend, instruct and warn users to remove this directory after installation however it is clear that many users ignore these warnings.  I have requested CVE numbers via oss-sec (awaiting list moderation).  As Redhat is using MantisBT 1.1.x you will need to apply the following patch to resolve the issue in this older version of MantisBT: <http://git.mantisbt.org/?p=mantisbt.git;a=commitdiff_plain;h=2641fdc60d2032ae1586338d6416e1eadabd7590>  We have also released MantisBT 1.2.4 which resolves the issue for users of our stable 1.2.x branch.  The bug report tracking this issue upstream at MantisBT: <http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=12607>  If there are any questions or concerns please feel free to contact me.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-12-15 10:20:31 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c0)) Hi David,    thank you for such a complete report.  >  > I have requested CVE numbers via oss-sec (awaiting list moderation).    Looks like the CVE identifiers request did not made it to oss-security yet.  To Gianluca: We will update this bug with CVE identifiers later, once they are assigned to the issues. Could you please schedule Fedora MantisBT updates with the patch below? (Fedora bug will follow shortly)  >  > As Redhat is using MantisBT 1.1.x you will need to apply the following > patch to resolve the issue in this older version of MantisBT: > <http://git.mantisbt.org/?p=mantisbt.git;a=commitdiff_plain;h=2641fdc60d2032ae1586338d6416e1eadabd7590>  Thanks && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-12-15 10:23:55 UTC  ``` These issues affect the versions of the mantis package, as shipped with Fedora release of 13 and 14.  These issues affect the version of the mantis package, as present within EPEL-5 repository.  Please schedule an update (patch is above).   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-12-15 10:27:47 UTC  ``` Public PoCs (from <http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=12607>):  1), cross-site scripting (XSS):     http://[mantis_root_host]/admin/upgrade_unattended.php?db_type=%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C/script%3E  2), local file inclusion (LFI):     http://[mantis_root_host]/admin/upgrade_unattended.php?db_type=..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fboot.ini%00  3), path disclosure (PD):     http://[mantis_root_host]/admin/upgrade_unattended.php?db_type=%27   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-12-15 10:30:51 UTC  ``` Created mantis tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 663299](show_bug.cgi?id=663299 "CLOSED ERRATA - MantisBT <1.2.4 multiple vulnerabilities (LFI, XSS and PD) [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c5)  Gianluca Sforna    2010-12-15 10:37:54 UTC  ``` I guess it's relevant to note the default apache configuration provided with the mantis package includes the following.   # Admin directory access is disabled by default; do not change this unless # you are performing the first installation or a database schema update. # See README.Fedora for more details <Directory /usr/share/mantis/admin> 	Order   Deny,Allow 	Deny    from All 	Allow   from None </Directory>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c6)  David Hicks    2010-12-15 10:53:56 UTC  ``` Thanks Jan & Gianluca.  Debian (and by extension Ubuntu) use the same Apache configuration to help protect the /admin/ directory. As a result they have decided that the severity of the bug is not as high as first anticipated by upstream.  I guess it comes down to whether a typical user of this package will keep the /admin/ directory permissions in a locked down state.  This issue is more of a concern for Gentoo (and MantisBT users using the upstream package) where the /admin/ directory permissions are not in place.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c7)  David Hicks    2010-12-16 14:11:13 UTC  ``` From Josh Bressers (oss-sec mailing list):  CVE-2010-4348: Cross site scripting CVE-2010-4349: Path disclosure CVE-2010-4350: Local file inclusion   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c8)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-12-16 14:38:52 UTC  ``` Gianluca, David, thank you for the comments: [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c5](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c5 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-4348 CVE-2010-4349 CVE-2010-4350 MantisBT <1.2.4 multiple vulnerabilities (LFI, XSS and PD)") [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c6](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c6 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-4348 CVE-2010-4349 CVE-2010-4350 MantisBT <1.2.4 multiple vulnerabilities (LFI, XSS and PD)")  (In reply to [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c5)) > I guess it's relevant to note the default apache configuration provided with > the mantis package includes the following. >  >  > # Admin directory access is disabled by default; do not change this unless > # you are performing the first installation or a database schema update. > # See README.Fedora for more details  Based on the above comments decreased severity of the issues to moderate. But we should still address them (to sanitize / protect also not so likely configurations).   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c9)  Gianluca Sforna    2011-02-21 23:23:55 UTC  ``` This was fixed in 1.1.8-5   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c0)  David Hicks    2010-12-15 03:19:40 UTC  ``` The MantisBT project was notified by Gjoko Krstic of Zero Science Lab (gjoko) of multiple vulnerabilities affecting MantisBT <1.2.4.  The two following advisories have been released explaining the vulnerabilities in greater detail:  <http://www.zeroscience.mk/en/vulnerabilities/ZSL-2010-4983.php> <http://www.zeroscience.mk/en/vulnerabilities/ZSL-2010-4984.php>  As one of these vulnerabilities allows the reading of arbitrary files from the file system we are treating this issue with critical severity. Please note that this issue only affects users who have not removed the "admin" directory from their MantisBT installation. We recommend, instruct and warn users to remove this directory after installation however it is clear that many users ignore these warnings.  I have requested CVE numbers via oss-sec (awaiting list moderation).  As Redhat is using MantisBT 1.1.x you will need to apply the following patch to resolve the issue in this older version of MantisBT: <http://git.mantisbt.org/?p=mantisbt.git;a=commitdiff_plain;h=2641fdc60d2032ae1586338d6416e1eadabd7590>  We have also released MantisBT 1.2.4 which resolves the issue for users of our stable 1.2.x branch.  The bug report tracking this issue upstream at MantisBT: <http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=12607>  If there are any questions or concerns please feel free to contact me.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-12-15 10:20:31 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c0)) Hi David,    thank you for such a complete report.  >  > I have requested CVE numbers via oss-sec (awaiting list moderation).    Looks like the CVE identifiers request did not made it to oss-security yet.  To Gianluca: We will update this bug with CVE identifiers later, once they are assigned to the issues. Could you please schedule Fedora MantisBT updates with the patch below? (Fedora bug will follow shortly)  >  > As Redhat is using MantisBT 1.1.x you will need to apply the following > patch to resolve the issue in this older version of MantisBT: > <http://git.mantisbt.org/?p=mantisbt.git;a=commitdiff_plain;h=2641fdc60d2032ae1586338d6416e1eadabd7590>  Thanks && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-12-15 10:23:55 UTC  ``` These issues affect the versions of the mantis package, as shipped with Fedora release of 13 and 14.  These issues affect the version of the mantis package, as present within EPEL-5 repository.  Please schedule an update (patch is above).   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-12-15 10:27:47 UTC  ``` Public PoCs (from <http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=12607>):  1), cross-site scripting (XSS):     http://[mantis_root_host]/admin/upgrade_unattended.php?db_type=%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C/script%3E  2), local file inclusion (LFI):     http://[mantis_root_host]/admin/upgrade_unattended.php?db_type=..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fboot.ini%00  3), path disclosure (PD):     http://[mantis_root_host]/admin/upgrade_unattended.php?db_type=%27   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-12-15 10:30:51 UTC  ``` Created mantis tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 663299](show_bug.cgi?id=663299 "CLOSED ERRATA - MantisBT <1.2.4 multiple vulnerabilities (LFI, XSS and PD) [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c5)  Gianluca Sforna    2010-12-15 10:37:54 UTC  ``` I guess it's relevant to note the default apache configuration provided with the mantis package includes the following.   # Admin directory access is disabled by default; do not change this unless # you are performing the first installation or a database schema update. # See README.Fedora for more details <Directory /usr/share/mantis/admin> 	Order   Deny,Allow 	Deny    from All 	Allow   from None </Directory>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c6)  David Hicks    2010-12-15 10:53:56 UTC  ``` Thanks Jan & Gianluca.  Debian (and by extension Ubuntu) use the same Apache configuration to help protect the /admin/ directory. As a result they have decided that the severity of the bug is not as high as first anticipated by upstream.  I guess it comes down to whether a typical user of this package will keep the /admin/ directory permissions in a locked down state.  This issue is more of a concern for Gentoo (and MantisBT users using the upstream package) where the /admin/ directory permissions are not in place.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c7)  David Hicks    2010-12-16 14:11:13 UTC  ``` From Josh Bressers (oss-sec mailing list):  CVE-2010-4348: Cross site scripting CVE-2010-4349: Path disclosure CVE-2010-4350: Local file inclusion   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c8)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-12-16 14:38:52 UTC  ``` Gianluca, David, thank you for the comments: [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c5](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c5 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-4348 CVE-2010-4349 CVE-2010-4350 MantisBT <1.2.4 multiple vulnerabilities (LFI, XSS and PD)") [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c6](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c6 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-4348 CVE-2010-4349 CVE-2010-4350 MantisBT <1.2.4 multiple vulnerabilities (LFI, XSS and PD)")  (In reply to [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c5)) > I guess it's relevant to note the default apache configuration provided with > the mantis package includes the following. >  >  > # Admin directory access is disabled by default; do not change this unless > # you are performing the first installation or a database schema update. > # See README.Fedora for more details  Based on the above comments decreased severity of the issues to moderate. But we should still address them (to sanitize / protect also not so likely configurations).   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=663230#c9)  Gianluca Sforna    2011-02-21 23:23:55 UTC  ``` This was fixed in 1.1.8-5   ``` |  |
