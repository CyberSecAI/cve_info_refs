        "vulnerability": "It was discovered that Tomcat did not properly escape certain parameters in the Manager application which could result in browsers becoming vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks when processing the output. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing server output during a crafted server request, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data (such as passwords), within the same domain."

      "root_cause": "The root cause is improper handling of user-provided parameters within the Tomcat Manager application.",

      "impact": "A remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code in the context of a user's browser, steal sensitive information (such as session cookies), or redirect users to a malicious site. An attacker could modify the content of a page.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting malicious URLs that include unsanitized parameters such as sort and orderBy.",

        "Apply patches or upgrade Tomcat versions to 6.0.30 or higher. Tomcat 7.0.5 or later also contains fixes."
