branch. The migration path for this release is 15.1T or a later release.

CSCth03022 Crafted SIP packets may cause device to reload.

Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) implementation in Cisco IOS
Software and Cisco IOS XE Software that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a
reload of an affected device or trigger memory leaks that may result in system instabilities. Affected
devices would need to be configured to process SIP messages for these vulnerabilities to be exploitable.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds
for devices that must run SIP; however, mitigations are available to limit exposure to the vulnerabilities.

This advisory is posted at http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20110928-sip.shtml.

CSCti33534 "no ipv6 address autoconfig" may cause crash after router advert flood.

Symptom After launching a flood of random IPv6 router advertisements when an interface is configured
with ''ipv6 address autoconf'', removing the IPv6 configuration on the interface with ''no ipv6 address
autoconf'' may cause a reload. Other system instabilities are also possible during and after the flood of
random IPv6 router advertisements.

Conditions Cisco IOS is configured with ''ipv6 address autoconf''.

Workaround Not using IPv6 auto-configuration may be used as a workaround.

  Caveats

Note

Cisco IOS checks for the hop limit field in incoming Neighbour Discovery messages and packets
received with a hop limit not equal to 255 are discarded. This means that the flood of ND messages has
to come from a host that is directly connected to the Cisco IOS device.

CSCtg64478 IOS-NAT drops SIP INVITE packet.

Symptom Router drops valid packets, causing SIP call to fail.

Conditions This is only for SIP traffic using SDP.

Workaround There is no workaround.

CSCsw64971 NAT-Entry deletion fails in SNAT backup router for H.323 RAS traffic.

Symptom NAT-Entry deletion fails in SNAT backup router for H.323 RAS traffic.  We can also see
crashes on the Standby router if the Active interface is brought up.

Conditions This can occur when using SNAT with HSRP and has been seen on numerous images.

Workaround There is no workaround.

CSCsx49358 Ping fails between the 6CE-6PE over the MPLS cloud.

Symptom A Cisco router may face ping failure between provider and customer networks.

Conditions This can occur on routers running Cisco IOS Release 12.4(23.15)T3.

Workaround There is no workaround.

CSCte91259 Dynamic DNS may crash router.

Symptom A Cisco router may unexpectedly reload due to a bus error after displaying an
"%IDMGR-3-INVALID_ID" error.

Conditions The crash will be seen only if the router is using DHCP Client Dynamic DNS update.

Workaround There is no workaround.

  Caveats

CSCtg41606 RRI configuration drops egress traffic due to incomplete adjacency.

Symptom With Reverse Route Injection (RRI) configured with the reverse-route command, if the crypto
map is applied to a multi-access interface (for example, ethernet), then egress traffic may fail when the
router cannot populate an ARP entry for the crypto peer address.

Conditions The symptom could occur when the upstream device does not support proxy arping.

Workaround Use the reverse-route remote-peer <next-hop-ip> command instead of the reverse-route
command.

CSCtc73759 H323 gatekeeper crashing upon receipt of specific traffic.

Symptom The H.323 gatekeeper implementation in Cisco IOS Software is crashing after receiving
specific traffic.

Conditions This issue occurs after receiving specific content on the TCP/H.245 session or the H.323
gatekeeper RAS device either on Cisco IOS releases 12.4(20)T1-ES5 or 12.4(20)T4.

Workaround There is no workaround. Refer to the advisory posted at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20100922-h323.shtml.

CSCtg41733 Memory Leak on SIP UDP REGISTER Call Paths During Fuzzing.

Symptom Certain crafted packets may cause a memory leak in the device in very rare circumstances.

Conditions This symptom is observed on a Cisco IOS router configured for SIP processing.

Workaround Disable SIP if it is not needed.

CSCtb73450 L2TPv3: SCCRQ packets causes tunnel to reset after digest failure.

Symptom Start-Control-Connection-Request (SCCRQ) packets may cause tunnel to reset after digest
failure.

Conditions This issue is observed when the SCCRQ packets are sent with an incorrect hash.

Workaround Disable SIP if it is not needed.

CSCtg64478 IOS-NAT drops SIP INVITE packet.

Symptom Router drops valid packets, causing SIP call to fail.

Conditions This is only for SIP traffic using SDP.

Workaround There is no workaround.

CSCsd34855 VTP update with a VLAN name >100 characters causes buffer overflow.

Symptom The VTP feature in certain versions of Cisco IOS software is vulnerable to a locally exploitable
buffer overflow condition and potential execution of arbitrary code. If a VTP summary advertisement is
received with a Type-Length-Value (TLV) containing a VLAN name greater than 100 characters, the
receiving switch will reset with an Unassigned Exception error.

Conditions The packets must be received on a trunk enabled port, with a matching domain name and a
matching VTP domain password (if configured). On the September 13, 2006, The Phenoelit Group
posted an advisory containing three vulnerabilities: VTP Version field DoS, Integer Wrap in VTP
revision, and Buffer Overflow in VTP VLAN name. These vulnerabilities are addressed by the following
Cisco IDs: CSCsd52629/CSCsd34759-VTP version field DoS, CSCse40078/CSCse47765-Integer Wrap
in VTP revision, and CSCsd34855/CSCei54611-Buffer Overflow in VTP VLAN name. Cisco statement
and further information are available on the Cisco public website at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sr-20060913-vtp.shtml.

Workaround There is no workaround.

CSCsv01339 Unable to ping some devices on subnet.

CSCsv20058 Duplicate H245-alphanumeric at digit_end on rfc2833 to h245-alpha.

Symptom Upon digit_end on the RFC-2833 side, the IPIP GW misinterprets this and sends out
h245-alphanumeric, which is duplicate. Typically, the IPIP GW should ignore all the tone packets after
the digit_begin is detected until the digit_end.

Conditions RTP-NTE to H245-Alphanumeric conversion is triggering this event.

CSCsw49855 Ping stops working during speed/duplex testing.

Symptom IP connectivity fails for the interface following extended pings from FastEthernet interface.
The show interface command will indicate that the output queue is wedged:

Output queue: 40/40 (size/max)

No more packets are switched out of the interface until the interface is cleared with the clear interface
fast<#> command.

Conditions This is seen on a Cisco 881 running IOS versions 12.4(20)T1 and T2. No indication at this
time that this is specific to these images. The problem is observed when the FastEthernet interface in
question is set to 10/half or 100/half.

Workaround Once the problem has occurred, clear the interface with the command clear interface
fast<#>. This problem has not yet been seen on an interface in full duplex mode.

CSCsx30643 TDM ERL always reports +6.0 dB for VWIC2 T1/E1 voice-ports using HWECAN.

Symptom When querying for low-level DSP statistics for an active voice call the TDM ERL level
reported is always identically +6.0 dB and never fluctuates:

Conditions This behavior is observed on Cisco IOS Voice GateWays installed with digital voice-ports
configured on the VWIC2-1MFT-T1/E1 or VWIC2-2MFT-T1/E1 cards, and enabled with the
EC-MFT-32 or EC-MFT-64 HardWare Echo CANcellation (HWECAN) daughter cards. The installed
IOS version is any 12.4 or 12.4T release which supports the VWIC2 and EC-MFT hardware.

Workaround There is no known workaround available. If real-time visibility into the measured TDM
ERL is desired, it is necessary to configure the digital voice-ports to use the SoftWare ECAN
(SWECAN) by setting echo-cancel enable type software. A shutdown/no shutdown of the voice-ports
is recommended to ensure the new setting takes effect.

CSCsx49309 FTP pauses 80 seconds in response to copy /verify ftp: flash: op prompt.

Symptom When using the copy ftp:// command to update IOS software issued on a router, it is seen that
it takes approximately 80 seconds before the file transfer begins.

Conditions This is seen on a 2800 or 3800 series router, but is not seen on routers in other series, such as
2600 or 7200.

Workaround Use a different protocol to transfer the file, such as TFTP, RCP, or HTTP.

CSCsx67255 ISDN call failure with cause 47 after DSP allocation failure on channel.

Symptom An outgoing call from an IP phone to PSTN through ISDN PRI fails on a channel due to a DSP
allocation failure (not enough DSPs to support the call). Subsequent calls through that same channel
continue to fail with "resource unavailable" cause value equal to 47 even after DSP resources have been
made available to handle the call.

Conditions The symptom occurs on a router running Cisco IOS Release 12.4(15)T8 or higher. The call
must first fail with a legitimate DSP allocation error. Any call made through the same channel as the
failed call will also fail.

DSP allocation failures on gateway can be checked through the use of the exec command show voice
dsp group all. The last line of the show command output includes a counter for "DSP resource allocation
failure".

This issue can also be seen in some cases upon bootup. When a gateway is reloaded, system resources
will come up with a slightly different timing. If, for example, a PRI interface comes up before the DSP
resources have fully initialized, there may be a similar failure.

Workaround The workarounds are as follows:

(cid:129) Reload the router to clear the channel. If a reload cannot be done, busy out the channel with the

failed calls using the isdn busy b_channel command under the serial interface.

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

If the issue is due to oversubscription of the DSP resources, change the configuration to meet the
DSP resources available on the gateway. Further information can be found with the DSP Calculator
at http://www.cisco.com/cgi-bin/Support/DSP/cisco_prodsel.pl.

If the issue is related to timing issues upon reload, shutdown the voice-port in question before
reloading the gateway. When the gateway comes back up, take the voice-port out of shutdown.

CSCsx75353 High CPU Utilization seen on 2821 after upgrade to 12.4(15)T5.

Symptom High CPU usage is observed on a Cisco 2821 router. An increase of almost 10 percent in CPU
utilization is observed with every voice call.

Conditions This symptom is observed when an AIM compression card is present on the motherboard
(specifically AIM-COMPR2-V2).

Workaround Remove the AIM compression card from the motherboard.

CSCsy31552 ADSL WIC/ATM interface stops forwarding traffic & reports output drops.

Symptom A Cisco 1841 router equipped with xDSL WIC will suddenly stop forwarding packets. The
packets will appear as output drops on the ATM interface statistics. Under the PVC level, there are no
drops. The DSL line is not flapping but the ATM interface(s) report output drops.

Conditions The symptom is observed when using a Cisco 1800 and 2800 series router equipped with the

is in forwarding mode.

Workaround Reload the router.

CSCsy32246 Call waiting tone not heard when caller-id is enabled for sip dsapp fxs.

Symptom The call-waiting tone will not be generated and the caller ID will not be displayed for the
second call to a phone connected to a FXS port.

Conditions SIP Server -[sip]- Gateway (fxs) -- Analog phone

This is seen to occur when the Device Service Application (DSAPP) is enabled on the gateway to
provide supplementary features for the phone connected to the FXS port using SIP. Configuring either
caller-id enable or caller-id enable type 2 on the FXS voice port will trigger this issue.

Workaround Configuring caller-id enable type 1 under the voice port will provide call-waiting tone.
However, caller-id will not be provided for the second call.

CSCsy37164 WINKUP minimum timer fails to expire on c3800 platforms on outbound
calls.

Symptom A c3800 platform may intermittently fail to expire the CAS WINKUP minimum timer. This
timer dictates how long a T1 CAS, wink-start endpoint must remain offhook before completing a wink.
Failure to expire the timer will cause the c3800 to incorrectly classify a valid wink as invalid, failing
outbound calls.

Conditions This can happen when there is a brief period of increased CPU usage while a call is in the
process of connecting. In other words, a small spike in CPU usage can cause the time to fail to expire,
thereby causing a wink failure.

Workaround Disable any periodic processes which may cause momentary spikes in CPU usage, such as
SNMP polling, EEM scripts, or other automated processes. This may or may not help depending on the
cause of the CPU spikes.

way conversation is then established between Phone A (xxx) and Phone C (zzz). Then the call is
disconnected.

When Phone A is checked, in Placed Calls, there is "Phone C yyy" instead of "Phone B yyy".

Conditions It happens with IP phones 7942/61/62 and latest version of firmwares 8.4.1-8.4.3. With 8.3.4

CSCsy88059 Second call gets dropped when the first call is put on hold.

Symptom Calls drop when answering the second call on Octo lines with the ‘Hold’ softkey.

Conditions If the calls come in a PRI or FXO interface, and a user on an active call on the octoline puts
the call on hold while there is an incoming call, it will automatically answer the incoming call.
Approximately 13 seconds later the second call is dropped.

Workaround When the second call comes in, use the ‘Answer’ softkey instead of putting the first call on
hold. If the user requires to put a call on hold while a new call is coming in, they must wait until the
incoming call stops ringing.

CSCsz23528 IO MEM autosizing must take Dovetail increased IOMEM usage into
account.

Symptom After upgrading to 12.4(24)T images or newer, the amount of free IO MEM reported by show
memory command output is much lower (4MB less) than with previous versions. The amount of IO
MEM allocated upon boot up of the router has not changed with respect to previous versions.

This change in memory consumption is expected due to the integration of new features.

Conditions This defect is seen on 12.4(24)T on ISR platforms (28xx, 38xx series).

Workaround The amount of IO MEM can be increased manually by performing the following in

CSCsz52576 vlan.dat file lost after second power cycle - VTP Domain Name
disappears.

Symptom The vlan.dat file gets deleted after the second reload of the router, and the VLAN definition
and names are lost (not the interfaces and IP addresses). It has been observed that when the vlan.dat is
lost, in sh vtp status, the VTP Domain Name is blank (and was properly configured before).

Conditions This behavior is observed in a Cisco 3270 router that is running Cisco IOS Release 12.4(24)T.
It is also observed with Cisco 1800 ISR with switch modules in Cisco IOS Release 12.4(22)T.

Workaround There is no workaround. Customer needs to reconfigure them again after reboot. This
problem is not observed in Cisco IOS Release 12.4(15)T.

Further Problem Description: When a customer is running an image that does not store the VTP and
VLAN information in the start-up configuration or the normal output of show running-config, the
vlan.dat file gets overridden to the default vlan.dat approximately 2 minutes after reboot. The current
VLANs and VTP information remains operational until the router is rebooted.

A reboot causes the VLANs and VTP information to disappear because the start-up configuration does
not contain any VLAN or VTP information, nor does the vlan.dat file in flash.

The operating VTP information appears in the output of show running-config all (which shows
non-default and default values), indicating that the router considers the VTP information to be at default
values even when there is a VTP domain name configured. This allows the VLANs and VTP to remain
operational until the router is rebooted.

CSCsz65335 RTSP not releasing socket when socket connect attempt fails.

Symptom VXML gateway is unable to open an RTSP connection to media server after media server is
taken down and then brought back up.

Conditions The problem is observed when the media server is no longer reachable from the VXML
gateway. When this occurs the VXML gateway attempts to open an RTSP socket connection to the
media server. The socket connection attempt is not successful but the VXML gateway does not release
the socket. With each connection attempt the socket is incremented until the max of 2047 is reached.
Once the max is reached, the VXML gateway will no longer attempt to open a socket to the media server

CSCsz74629 Delay in propagation of interface link down state.

Symptom There is a delay in the propagation of interface link down state. Link failure is detected with a

12.4(24)T.

Workaround The default keepalive period is 10 seconds and the periodic function which updates the link
state change runs on the order of keepalive time, hence it takes long time to detect the link down state.
If keepalive is set to 1 or 2 seconds, the time taken to detect link down is normal.

CSCsz92704 Voice GWs not supporting DSPfarm services should provide warning
message.

Symptom IOS Voice GateWay (VGW) platform families like the IAD2430, VG224, VG202, and VG204
are fixed form-factor VGWs which have C5510 DSPs soldered onto the mainboard. As such they are not
expandable to install extra DSP resources and are meant primarily as TDM-IP devices. Nonetheless in
most IOS releases it is possible to configure dsp services dspfarm under the voice-card 0 CLI in the
running-config as well as to set dspfarm profile N <conference|transcode> even though transcoding
and conferencing services are not supported on these platforms. There aren’t enough DSPs available to
make these DSP services viable in addition to accommodating regular TDM-IP VoIP calls. Attempts at
sustaining a conference or transcoding call fail, users get confused and open up TAC Service Requests.

Conditions This behavior is observed on fixed form-factor IOS Voice GateWay platform families like
the Cisco IAD2430, VG224, VG202, and VG204, installed with any release of IOS.

Workaround Not applicable. DSP transcoding and conferencing features are not supported on the

CSCta14536 Router crash pointing to SYS-6-STACKLOW on IPIPGW.

Symptom A Cisco IOS VoIP gateway configured for IPIPGW (CUBE) functionality may crash.

Conditions A gateway configured for IPIPGW functionality with the command allow-connections under
voice service voip under rare conditions will crash while processing VoIP calls.

This has been found to occur in some scenarios where a single voip call loops (meaning the call is from
the IPIPGW back to the same IPIPGW) through the IPIPGW.

When this occurs, the following error message may be noticed:

%SYS-6-STACKLOW: Stack for process IP Input running low, 0/12000

Workaround The workaround is to track down the source of the call looping and correct the problem
there.

The other possible workaround is to introduce another termination point in the RTP packet flow beside
the IPIPGW. For example, if interworking with Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Callmanager)
a MTP resource may be used to prevent this loop as long as the MTP resource is not the CUBE gateway.

CSCta16495 IOS should warn if no DSP resources exist for voice-port at bootup.

Symptom When the router boots up, voice ports that require DSPs like FXO and FXS cards do not show
up in the running configuration. The card shows up in show diag, show inventory, and show version
but the "voice-port 0/0/0" does not show up in the configuration.

Conditions This happens when there are no available DSPs for the voice ports to use on bootup. The
system should print a command similar to: %VOICE-PORT-INIT: Voice-port 0/0/0 was not
initialized due to a lack of DSP resources.

This indicates that analog voice ports did not have enough DSPs to initialize. show voice dsp group all
should be used to validate there are enough DSPs. The DSP calculator
(http://www.cisco.com/cgi-bin/Support/DSP/cisco_prodsel.pl) should be used to ensure the router has
sufficient PVDM modules.

Workaround This bug addresses adding the bootup command: %VOICE-PORT-INIT: Voice-port
0/0/0 was not initialized due to a lack of DSP resources.

  Caveats

CSCta40055 Placed calls directory on CUCME shows local user name if overlapping
extensions exist.

Symptom When using overlapping dial-plans between 2 CUCME sites, the "Placed Calls" directory of
the originating phone will display the correct called number, but the incorrect called name. CUCME
correlates the called number with the local username, even though a unique prefix was prepended, and
dialed, to the main extension.

Workaround There is no workaround.

CSCta40916 TOH played for incoming H323 call before media negotiation occurs.

Symptom CME: IP phone when answered hears hold tone before getting proper media from the far end.
Sometimes the call stays up; other times it drops with cause temp failure.

Conditions CME receiving/sending H323 slow start call over IP.

Workaround Use H.323 fast start.

Further Problem Description: Issue appears to be more visible in cause of slow WAN links (ex:
Satellite links)

CSCta54469 During consult transfer, if call on hold disconnects the second leg
drops.

Symptom During consult transfer, if call on hold disconnects before user can dial the consult leg, the
consult leg will drop. The disconnect times vary from 60-90 seconds

Conditions Phone A calls Phone B. Phone B hits the transfer button to do a consult transfer which places
Phone A on hold. Phone A hangs up before Phone B can dial. Phone B dials Phone C. Call from phone
B to Phone C is dropped after about 1 minute.

Debugs show the CME forcing the DN back into an onhook state.

Workaround Configuring transfer-digit-collect orig-call will abort the transfer attempt when the first leg
disconnects.

CSCta63555 CME crashes after submitting SNR number change menu from EM phone.

Symptom A router crashes if running with Cisco IOS Release 12.4(24)T or later.

Conditions The symptom is observed if the SNR number change menu is selected from an extension
mobility phone. The router crashes after submitting the change.

Workaround Configure an SNR under the user-profile or logout-profile with which the extension
mobility phone is provisioned.

  Caveats

CSCta69407 DSP isn't told to "turn off" digits with mgcp dtmf-relay nte-gw /
nte-ca.

Symptom When using mgcp dtmf-relay type nte-gw, a sniffer trace will reveal that digits are sent both
in-band (within the audio stream) and out-of-band (dtmf-relay). Because of this, double digits can be
seen in Unity and MeetingPlace.

Conditions GW with PRI/CAS backhaul via MGCP to CUCM and mgcp dtmf-relay configured to use
nte-gw.

Workaround Use mgcp dtmf-relay type out-of-band.

CSCta98556 Clientless webvpn incorrectly redirected access to web portal.

Symptom Incorrect redirection is seen while using IOS WebVPN.

Conditions Only seen with IE8.

Workaround IE6 can be used as a workaround

Further Problem Description: Customer has two servers (A,B) protected behind the IOS WebVPN.
Some pages on server A automatically does a silent login to server B and gets the information required
to generate reports. When using IE8 this login information does not get properly propagated to the
backend server B which results in redirection request to the login page from server B.

CSCtb42748 No Ringback on Incoming SIP to AA to SNR line with different codecs.

Symptom No Ringback on Incoming SIP to AA to SNR line with different codecs.

Conditions

(cid:129) The incoming call is from SIP trunk.

(cid:129) The outgoing call to mobile has different codec than the incoming call leg.

(cid:129) The mobile phone on the sip trunk needs to send back the 183 progress message while ringing.

(cid:129) User is not able to hear the ringback tone after ringing the mobile phone.

Workaround There is no workaround.

  Caveats

CSCtb43226 12.4 IOS MGCP generates 510 remote description error.

Symptom Voice call is rejected, because gateway replies 510 error for MDCX message.

Conditions Interworking with third party IAD device, which doesn’t support NSE codec, will mess up
SDP format.

Workaround Disable t38 and modem passthrough so gateway doesn’t generate NSE in SDP.

CSCtb66305 Shared-dn ephone unregister affects another ephone BLF subscription.

Symptom cme on c3825-advipservicesk9-mz.124-24.T1.bin

one ephone UNREGISTER_ABNORMAL, the other ephone with shared DN will stop sending BLF
presence subscription.

Example:

ephone 34 button 1:5 2:4
ephone 61 blf-speed-dial 1 ... button 1:5 2:4

when ephone 34 unregisters, ephone 61 stops sending presence subscription.
