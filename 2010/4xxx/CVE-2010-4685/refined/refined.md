    *   **Weaknesses:** Crafted SIP packets can cause a device reload or trigger memory leaks.
    *   **Impact:** Device reload or system instability.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending crafted SIP packets.
    *  **Required Capabilities:** Unauthenticated, remote attacker.
    *  **More Info:**  Mentions a Cisco Security Advisory is available with more details.
2. **CSCtg41733:**
   *   **Root Cause:** Memory leak in SIP UDP REGISTER call paths.
   *   **Weaknesses:** Certain crafted packets can cause a memory leak.
   *   **Impact:** Memory leak, potentially leading to system instability.
   *   **Attack Vector:** Sending crafted packets on SIP UDP REGISTER call paths.
   *  **Required Capabilities:** Specific crafted packets, SIP processing enabled.
3. **CSCsd34855:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Buffer overflow in VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol) due to a VLAN name exceeding 100 characters.
    *   **Weaknesses:**  VTP summary advertisement with a long VLAN name.
    *   **Impact:** Device reset with an "Unassigned Exception" error, potential arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted VTP packet with a long VLAN name.
    *    **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be on the same VTP domain, with a matching password, on a trunk enabled port.
    *   **More Info:**  Mentions an advisory posted by The Phenoelit Group and a related Cisco Security Advisory.
4. **CSCtf91428 / CSCtf17624:**
    *  **Root Cause:** Denial-of-service vulnerabilities in the Network Address Translation (NAT) functionality.
    *  **Weaknesses:** Vulnerabilities in the translation of SIP packets, H.323 packets, and H.225.0 call signaling for H.323 packets.
    *  **Impact:** Denial of service.
    *  **Attack Vector:** Sending specific crafted SIP and H.323 packets
    *  **Required Capabilities:** Requires traffic to be processed via the affected NAT functionality.
    * **More Info:**  Mentions a Cisco Security Advisory is available with more details.
5. **CSCte14603:**
   *   **Root Cause:** Vulnerability in the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) version 3 implementation.
   *   **Weaknesses:** Malicious IGMPv3 packets
   *   **Impact:** Device reload, sustained denial-of-service (DoS).
   *   **Attack Vector:** Sending malicious IGMPv3 packets.
   *    **Required Capabilities:** Unauthenticated, remote attacker.
   *  **More Info:**  Mentions a Cisco Security Advisory is available with more details.
6. **CSCtd33567 / CSCta19962 / CSCtb93855:**
    *   **Root Cause:**  Vulnerabilities in the H.323 implementation.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Exploitable via remote H.323 traffic
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending crafted H.323 packets.
    *  **Required Capabilities:** Remote attacker targeting the H.323 implementation.
    *  **More Info:** Mentions a Cisco Security Advisory is available with more details.
7.  **CSCtf72678:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Multiple vulnerabilities in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) implementation.
    *  **Weaknesses:** Crafted SIP packets.
    *   **Impact:** Device reload.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending crafted SIP packets.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Unauthenticated, remote attacker with SIP operation enabled.
    *  **More Info:**  Mentions a Cisco Security Advisory is available with more details.
