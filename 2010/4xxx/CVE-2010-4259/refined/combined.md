How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=659359#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-12-02 16:11:48 UTC  ``` Ulrik Persson reported a stack-based buffer overflow flaw in the way FontForge font editor processed certain Bitmap Distribution Format (BDF) font files, with specially-crafted value of the CHARSET_REGISTRY header. A remote attacker could create a specially-crafted BDF font file and trick a local, unsuspecting user into opening it in FontForge, which could lead to fontforge executable crash or, potentially, arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the executable.

# FontForge - '.BDF' Font File Stack Buffer Overflow (PoC)

#### EDB-ID:

###### 15732

#### CVE:

###### [2010-4259](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2010-4259)

**EDB Verified:**

#### Author:

###### [Ulrik Persson](/?author=3039)

**Vulnerable App:**

```
Source: https://www.securityfocus.com/bid/45162/info

FontForge is prone to a stack-based buffer-overflow vulnerability because the application fails to properly bounds-check user-supplied data before copying it into an insufficiently sized buffer.

An attacker could exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code in the context of the affected application. Failed exploit attempts will likely result in denial-of-service conditions.

FontForge 0.0.20100501-2 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Subject: fontforge: buffer overflow when opening .BDF files
Package: fontforge
Version: 0.0.20100501-2
Severity: important
Tags: security

Hello,

I have found a buffer overflow in fontforge when opening .BDF files. It is
a stack-based buffer overflow with full control over EIP, and it occurs
when parsing too long "CHARSET_REGISTRY" lines.

To reproduce, start fontforge with the attached example file as a parameter,
or start fontforge and then open the same file in the graphical interface.

thanks

Hi,

A patch (along with details) is available at:
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/659359>

When fixing the vulnerability please mention the id ([CVE-2010-4259](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4259)) in
the changelog.
Would be great if you could also prepare a fixed version for stable
(usual coordination with team@security.d.o applies.)

Thanks in advance.

Cheers,

I'm first taking care of unstable/testing and then I will look at the case
of stable.

Thanks for the heads up.

I just uploaded a new version for unstable (conservative upload---I would
have changed other stuff, but better not at this stage).

I'm just waiting for the FTP master announcement to see if it was accepted
or not.

> Kęstutis, will you handle this or do you need help in some way?

I'm having some trouble with my ISP right now and uploading stuff is getting
interrupted. :-(

Could any of you just copy my last SVN commit to a stable version (if
applicable)?

Subject: CVE Request -- FontForge: Stack-based buffer overflow by processing
 specially-crafted CHARSET_REGISTRY font file header

Hello Steve, vendors,

   Ulrik Persson reported a stack-based buffer overflow
flaw in the way FontForge font editor processed certain
Bitmap Distribution Format (BDF) font files, with
specially-crafted value of the CHARSET_REGISTRY header.
A remote attacker could create a specially-crafted BDF
font file and trick a local, unsuspecting user into
opening it in FontForge, which could lead to fontforge
executable crash or, potentially, arbitrary code execution
with the privileges of the user running the executable.

[1] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=605537>
[2] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=659359>

Public PoC:
[3] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?msg=5;filename=fontforge-overflow.txt;att=1;bug=605537>

Flaw severity note:
On systems with compile time buffer checks (FORTIFY_SOURCE)
feature enabled, the impact of this flaw is mitigated to
be only crash.

Could you allocate a CVE id for this issue?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.
