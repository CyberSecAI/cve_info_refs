... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Run this URL <https://localize.mozilla.org/te/bugzilla_components/translate.html?match_names=check-isfuzzy,untranslated,%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%22XSS%22%29%3C/script%3E&view_mode=review> Actual Results:   XSS possible  Expected Results:   No XSS vulnerabilty   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=647832#c1)  Dwayne Bailey    2010-10-29 15:50:20 UTC  ``` This is fixed upstream for 2.1: <http://translate.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/translate/src/branches/Pootle-2.1/local_apps/pootle_store/views.py?r1=16167&r2=16166&pathrev=16167>  This will be fixed with upstreams release of 2.1.2 bug fix release.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=647832#c2)  Vincent Danen    2010-10-29 20:47:52 UTC  ``` I see that 2.1.2 is now available:  <http://sourceforge.net/projects/translate/files/Pootle/2.1.2/>  But the README.txt there does not mention this security flaw.  Requesting clarification on whether we can make this bug public and get updates into Fedora.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=647832#c3)  Vincent Danen    2010-10-29 20:48:19 UTC  ``` Sorry, RELEASE.txt.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=647832#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2010-10-30 21:07:13 UTC  ``` RELEASE.txt contains:  This release includes an important security fix to a cross site scripting vulnerability in the translate page. All users are encouraged to upgrade immediately.
