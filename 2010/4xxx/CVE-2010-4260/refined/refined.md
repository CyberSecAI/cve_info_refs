  "details": [
    {
      "type": "Root cause",
      "text": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist in ClamAV's PDF processing code due to insufficient input validation, potentially leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution. Specifically, there are flaws in how the find_stream_bounds(), find_length() and cli_pdf() functions handle PDF files"
