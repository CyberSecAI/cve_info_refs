Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2010-4346:

**Root Cause:**

- The `install_special_mapping` routine in the Linux kernel, used for setting up special mappings like the vdso (Virtual Dynamic Shared Object), was missing a security check before inserting the mapping into the process's virtual memory space.
- Specifically, it was skipping the `security_file_mmap` check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Bypass of `mmap_min_addr` Restriction:** The `mmap_min_addr` sysctl setting is intended to prevent mappings at very low addresses, typically to help prevent null pointer dereference vulnerabilities and other issues. By skipping the security check, the vulnerability allows a local attacker to bypass this restriction and create mappings at lower addresses than intended.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Memory Mapping:** An attacker could potentially map arbitrary memory regions at very low addresses, including address zero, which could lead to various security issues, such as:
    - Null pointer dereferences: If the attacker maps memory at address zero, they could cause a program to crash if it attempts to dereference a null pointer.
   -  Other unexpected behavior: Mapping memory at low addresses could cause program to misbehave, potentially leading to privilege escalation or other security issues, although the provided content focuses specifically on bypassing mmap_min_addr.
- The vulnerability is more easily exploitable if the system has `mmap_min_addr` set to low values, such as 4096 as was done in Red Hat. The lower the value, the more likely the mapping will occur at address 0, which can be abused.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the system. A remote attacker wouldn't be able to exploit this directly, but it could be a component of a larger exploit chain after an attacker has already gained local access.
- **Crafted Program:** An attacker could create a crafted program that makes use of the `install_special_mapping` routine to bypass the `mmap_min_addr` restriction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Local user privileges are required
- Ability to execute code on the target system

**Additional Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in the `install_special_mapping` routine within the Linux kernel's memory management (`mm`) subsystem, specifically `mm/mmap.c`.
- The issue was also present in `bprm_mm_init()` in `fs/exec.c`, where the security check was also missing for stack mappings.

**Fix:**
- Patches were provided that introduce a `security_file_mmap` check in the `install_special_mapping` and `bprm_mm_init` routines before `insert_vm_struct` is called. This prevents mappings at low addresses by respecting the `mmap_min_addr` setting.

**CVE-Specific Notes:**

- The content notes Red Hat's initial assessment was incorrect, as a low `mmap_min_addr` value makes exploitation *easier* not harder.
- A PoC was created which demonstrates mapping a page at exactly one page below the configured `mmap_min_addr`.
- The fix for this issue was distributed via security updates in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and MRG.

In summary, CVE-2010-4346 is a vulnerability in the Linux kernel where a missing security check in the `install_special_mapping` routine allows local attackers to bypass the `mmap_min_addr` security restriction and map memory at very low addresses, including address zero, potentially leading to various security issues.
