 install_special_mapping skips security_file_mmap check

"The install_special_mapping routine (used, for example, to setup the vdso)
skips the security check before insert_vm_struct, allowing a local attacker to
bypass the mmap_min_addr security restriction by limiting the available pages
for special mappings."

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

 security_file_mmap check.]

FYI.

----- Forwarded message from Tavis Ormandy <taviso@...xchg8b.com> -----

Date: Thu, 9 Dec 2010 15:29:42 +0100
From: Tavis Ormandy <taviso@...xchg8b.com>
To: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@...ux-foundation.org>, Greg KH <gregkh@...e.de>
Cc: linux-kernel@...r.kernel.org, security@...nel.org, stable@...nel.org, kees@...ntu.com, eugene@...hat.com
Subject: [PATCH] install_special_mapping skips security_file_mmap check.

The install_special_mapping routine (used, for example, to setup the vdso)
skips the security check before insert_vm_struct, allowing a local attacker to
bypass the mmap_min_addr security restriction by limiting the available pages
for special mappings. bprm_mm_init() also skips the check, although I don't
think this can be used to bypass any restrictions, I don't see any reason not
to have the security check.

It's worth noting that Red Hat are shipping with mmap_min_addr set to 4096.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=662189#c0)  Petr Matousek    2010-12-10 20:28:43 UTC  ``` The install_special_mapping routine (used, for example, to setup the vdso) skips the security check before insert_vm_struct, allowing a local attacker to bypass the mmap_min_addr security restriction by limiting the available pages for special mappings.  Reference: <https://lkml.org/lkml/2010/12/9/222> <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2010/q4/307>  Acknowledgements: Red Hat would like to thank Tavis Ormandy for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=662189#c2)  Petr Matousek    2010-12-10 20:31:27 UTC  ``` Statement:  The Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 is not vulnerable because it checks for mmap_min_addr even in special cases.  The Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG have mmap_min_addr sysctl tunable set to 4096, and therefore are not affected by this issue. However, as a preventive measure (for example, for administrators who have increased mmap_min_addr), we have addressed this in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and MRG via <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0429.html>, <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0421.html>, and <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0330.html>.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=662189#c3)  Petr Matousek    2010-12-10 20:40:10 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 468055](attachment.cgi?id=468055 "Patch proposed by Tavis Ormandi") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=468055&action=edit "Patch proposed by Tavis Ormandi") Patch proposed by Tavis Ormandi   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=662189#c4)  Petr Matousek    2010-12-10 20:41:34 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 468057](attachment.cgi?id=468057 "RHEL5'ish patch proposed by Solar Designer") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=468057&action=edit "RHEL5'ish patch proposed by Solar Designer") RHEL5'ish patch proposed by Solar Designer   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=662189#c6)  Alexander Peslyak    2010-12-10 21:46:55 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=662189#c2)) > The Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and Red Hat > Enterprise MRG have mmap_min_addr sysctl tunable set to 4096, and therefore are > not affected by this issue.  I think this is a misunderstanding.  Your setting of mmap_min_addr to 4096 is precisely what makes you vulnerable to the fullest extent: the attack demonstrated by Tavis allows to map a page at exactly one page below mmap_min_addr, and you only have exactly one page - so it should get mapped at 0 (NULL).  Isn't this what happens when you try Tavis' PoC program on a clean RHEL 5 or 6 system?  I must admit I have not tried.  There might be something that prevents this from happening, but no one has mentioned such a thing so far (or have I missed it?)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=662189#c7)  Petr Matousek    2010-12-10 22:17:49 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=662189#c6)) > (In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=662189#c2)) > > The Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and Red Hat > > Enterprise MRG have mmap_min_addr sysctl tunable set to 4096, and therefore are > > not affected by this issue. >  > I think this is a misunderstanding.

There might be something > that prevents this from happening, but no one has mentioned such a thing so far > (or have I missed it?)  Update: The following seems to be true for RHEL6. On both systems vm.overcommit_memory=1 might be needed. On my testing RHEL5 system vdso keeps to be mapped to 0xffffe000 which looks like COMPAT_VDSO. Either way I was not able to use intstall_special_mapping() to map anything to address 0 on RHEL.  --  This is what I was thinking first as well and tried to make the vdso getting mapped to address 0. I tested it on a a 2.6.35 upstream kernel, but on RHEL it's the same (32bit program on x86-64, on 32bit it's similar):  cynique@gentoo64 ~ $ cat /proc/2588/maps 00001000-00002000 r-xp 00001000 03:03 230335   /home/cynique/nada 00002000-ffff2000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0       [stack] ffff2000-ffff3000 r-xp 00000000 00:00 0       [vdso] cynique@gentoo64 ~ $ nasm -D__NR_pause=29 -DBSS_SIZE=0xffffc000 -f elf -o nada.o nada.s cynique@gentoo64 ~ $ ld -m elf_i386 -Ttext=0x1000 -Tbss=0x2000 -o nada nada.o   cynique@gentoo64 ~ $ ./nada Killed cynique@gentoo64 ~ $  breakpoint 4, arch_get_unmapped_area_topdown (filp=0x0, addr0=0x0, len=0x1000, pgoff=0x0, flags=0x0) at arch/x86/kernel/sys_x86_64.c:192 192		} while (len < vma->vm_start); gdb> p len $23 = 0x1000 gdb> p vma->vm_start $24 = 0x1000 gdb>   The problem AFAIK is in the while condition: the len is 0x1000 because we are looking for one page and the next vma->vm_start is 0x1000 as that is a vma with /home/cynique/nada.

Tavis,

That's a nice find.

Their rationale is described in
linux-2.6-security-drop-mmap_min_addr-to-4096.patch.  Yet we've been
overriding this setting to 98304 in /etc/sysctl.conf on Owl, and I am
going to also patch the default in the kernel source now.

Meanwhile, here's a RHEL5'ish variation of your patch (only tested that
it compiles).
