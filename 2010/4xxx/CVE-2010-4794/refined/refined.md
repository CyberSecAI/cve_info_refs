Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described, which does relate to CVE-2010-4794:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The JS Calendar Joomla component version 1.5.1 does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries or displaying it back to the user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   The `ev_id` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection. Input is not sanitized before being used in SQL queries, allowing attackers to manipulate queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.
2.  **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   The `month` and `year` parameters are vulnerable to reflected XSS. Input is not sanitized before being returned to the user, allowing attackers to inject and execute arbitrary HTML and script code within the user's browser session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can potentially:
    *   Access sensitive data from the database, including user credentials (as shown in the example).
    *   Modify or delete data within the database.
    *   Potentially gain further control over the server if the database user has sufficient privileges
*   **Reflected XSS:** An attacker can:
    *   Execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session.
    *   Steal cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform other actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   By manipulating the `ev_id` parameter in the URL.
*   **Reflected XSS:**
    *   By manipulating the `month` and `year` parameters in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with malicious SQL code or JavaScript code as values for the vulnerable parameters.
*   The attacker needs to convince a user to visit the malicious URL (for XSS) or directly access the application with SQLi payload.

**Additional Information:**

* The provided exploit-db content references CVE-2010-4795 as well, but the content pertains to the same vulnerability in the JS Calendar Component.
* There is no fix available according to the information given in both sources.
