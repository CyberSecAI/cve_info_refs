1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

Package        : webkit
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2010-1783 CVE-2010-2901 CVE-2010-4199 CVE-2010-4040 CVE-2010-4492 CVE-2010-4493 CVE-2010-4577 CVE-2010-4578 CVE-2010-0474 CVE-2011-0482 CVE-2011-0778

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in webkit, a Web content engine
library for Gtk+. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:

CVE-2010-1783

  WebKit does not properly handle dynamic modification of a
  text node, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause
  a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) via a
  crafted HTML document.

CVE-2010-2901

  The rendering implementation in WebKit allows
  remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly
  have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors.

CVE-2010-4199

  WebKit does not properly perform a cast of an
  unspecified variable during processing of an SVG use element, which allows
  remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified
  other impact via a crafted SVG document.

CVE-2010-4040

  WebKit does not properly handle animated GIF images,
  which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption)
  or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted image.

CVE-2010-4492

  Use-after-free vulnerability in WebKit allows
  remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have
  unspecified other impact via vectors involving SVG animations.

CVE-2010-4493

  Use-after-free vulnerability in Webkit allows remote attackers to cause a
  denial of service via vectors related to the handling of mouse dragging events

CVE-2010-4577

  The CSSParser::parseFontFaceSrc function in WebCore/css/CSSParser.cpp in
  WebKit does not properly parse Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) token sequences,
  which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
  (out-of-bounds read) via a crafted local font, related to "Type Confusion."

CVE-2010-4578

  WebKit does not properly perform cursor handling, which allows remote
  attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other
  impact via unknown vectors that lead to "stale pointers."

CVE-2011-0482

  WebKit does not properly perform a cast of an unspecified variable during
  handling of anchors, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
  service or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted HTML document

CVE-2011-0778

  WebKit does not properly restrict drag and drop operations, which might allow
  remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy via unspecified vectors.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.2.7-0+squeeze1

For the testing distribution (wheezy), and the unstable distribution (sid),
these problems have been fixed in version 1.2.7-1

Security support for WebKit has been discontinued for the oldstable
distribution (lenny).
The current version in oldstable is not supported by upstream anymore
and is affected by several security issues. Backporting fixes for these
and any future issues has become unfeasible and therefore we need to
drop our security support for the version in oldstable.

We recommend that you upgrade your webkit packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

## [Stable, Beta Channel Updates](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2010/12/stable-beta-channel-updates.html "Stable, Beta Channel Updates")

Thursday, December 2, 2010

The Chrome team is happy to announce our latest Stable release, 8.0.552.215.  In addition to the over 800 bug fixes and stability improvements, Chrome 8 now contains a built in PDF viewer that is secured in Chrome’s sandbox.  As always, it also contains our latest security fixes, listed below.  This release will also be posted to the Beta Channel.

Security fixes and rewards:

Please see [the Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more detail. Note that the referenced bugs may be kept private until a majority of our users are up to date with the fix.

We would like to offer special thanks -- and a number of rewards -- to Aki Helin of OUSPG for his extensive help with the new PDF feature. We’d also like to extend thanks to Sergey Glazunov and Marc Schoenefeld for finding bugs during the development cycle such that they never reached a stable build.

Full details about the changes are available in the [SVN revision log](http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/dashboard/ui/changelog.html?url=/trunk/src&range=62249:58656&mode=html). If you find new issues, please let us know by [filing a bug](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry). Want to change to another Chrome release channel?
