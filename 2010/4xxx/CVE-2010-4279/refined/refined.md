    "vulnerability": {
      "Root cause": "The application uses a weak MD5 hashing algorithm to verify the user login instead of a stronger method and, by default, uses an empty password string.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Authentication bypass vulnerability",
         "Privilege escalation vulnerability"
      ],
      "Impact": "An attacker can bypass authentication and gain administrative access. This allows them to execute commands, inject code, access files, extract database information, and potentially gain full control over the web application and server.",
      "Attack vectors": "Remote HTTP requests",
       "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker can craft a specific URL with the username and the MD5 hash of the username to bypass the authentication."

       "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker must craft a specific URL to bypass authentication, and then exploit the file upload to place the php payload."
