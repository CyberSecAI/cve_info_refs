```
Package: gif2png
Version: 2.5.1-3
Severity: normal

gif2png is prone to a command line buffer overflow since there is an
strcpy(3) call that fails to bounds-check user-supplied data before copying
them to a fixed size buffer.  Here is a transcript:

[argp@hegel /tmp]$ gif2png `python -c 'print "A"*2048'`

The bug is located at file gif2png.c, line number 901
(strcpy(name, argv[i])) where name is a fixed size char array.  This may
have security repercussions if gif2png is configured as a handler for
other applications that can pass user-supplied filenames as command line
input to gif2png (e.g. from a CGI or other).

Hi Michael,

Please have a look on package changelog:
* Added 10_fix_gif2png_c.dpatch, closes: #[550978](bugreport.cgi?bug=550978)

Because upstream didn't answer my bug forwarding, I added a fix for this
issue as a dpatch in the package by myself.

Afterwards I checked with the suggested exploit:
--------------------8<---------------------------------------8<------------------------
es@neo:~$ gif2png `python -c 'print "A"*2048'`
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA: File name too long

ok, i just wanted to see if there was any validity to the full
disclosure claims.  they said they tested against 2.5.2-1, but they
very well could have been mistaken.  looks like this can be safely
closed.

Hi,

I am the Fedora maintainer of gif2png and think that the supplied patch
is incomplete.  In main(), there is done

| -	    strcpy(name, argv[i]);
| +	    strncpy( name, argv[i], sizeof( name ) );
|             ...
|  		strcat(name, ".gif");

which could still overflow 'name'.  I think that

  <http://cvs.fedoraproject.org/viewvc/rpms/gif2png/devel/gif2png-overflow.patch?revision=HEAD&root=extras&view=markup>

solves the issue better. It omits the changes in processfile() because
main() guarantees that 'fname' is short enough.

FWIW, 2.5.2 *is* affected; the -ENAMETOOLONG comes from the open(2)
call.  Applying a modified exploit like

  gif2png `perl -e "print '/' x 1024"`/a

still triggers the issue.

Enrico

You're right. Thank you for your attention.

But processfile() will remain insecure.
I will adapt my patch with your suggestions.

fwiw, I changed my patch to abort/fail when filename length exceeds a
certain size.  That's better than the current strncpy() stuff which
might cause to process a different file than this what was given (and
perhaps validated) by the caller.

does not matter... it is called from main() only which does all the
range checking.

Adjust the '1024'; on Fedora/RHEL not the buffer overflow caused the
crash but the FORTIFY_SORUCE checks.

$ gif2png `perl -e "print '/' x 1024"`/a

# gif2png: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201203-15**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in gif2png, the worst of
which might allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-gfx/gif2png** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.5.8** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.5.8** |

### Background

gif2png converts images from GIF format to PNG format.

### Description

Two vulnerabilities have been found in gif2png:

* A boundary error in gif2png.c could cause a buffer overflow
  (CVE-2010-4694).
* The patch for CVE-2009-5018 causes gif2png to truncate GIF pathnames
  (CVE-2010-4695).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted GIF
file, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code, a Denial of
Service condition, or the creation of PNG files in unintended
directories.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All gif2png users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/gif2png-2.5.8"

```

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=547515#c0)  Vincent Danen    2009-12-14 20:39:11 UTC  ``` gif2png suffers from a command-line buffer overflow due to an strcpy(3) call that fails to bounds-check user-supplied data before copying to a fixed size buffer, as reported to Debian [1].  To reproduce:  $ gif2png $(perl -e 'print "A" x 1053') *** buffer overflow detected ***: gif2png terminated ======= Backtrace: ========= /lib64/libc.so.6(__fortify_fail+0x37)[0x3b2d4f6ea7] /lib64/libc.so.6[0x3b2d4f4ec0] gif2png[0x402fb9] /lib64/libc.so.6(__libc_start_main+0xfd)[0x3b2d41eb1d] gif2png[0x401509  [1] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=550978>  Verified to affect Fedora 12.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=547515#c1)  Vincent Danen    2009-12-14 20:40:04 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 378342](attachment.cgi?id=378342&action=diff "patch pulled from debian's package to correct the issue") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=378342&action=edit "patch pulled from debian's package to correct the issue") patch pulled from debian's package to correct the issue   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=547515#c3)  Fedora Update System    2010-01-01 17:21:33 UTC  ``` gif2png-2.5.1-1200.fc12 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 12. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/gif2png-2.5.1-1200.fc12>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=547515#c4)  Fedora Update System    2010-01-01 17:22:38 UTC  ``` gif2png-2.5.1-1100.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/gif2png-2.5.1-1100.fc11>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=547515#c5)  Enrico Scholz    2010-01-01 17:24:31 UTC  ``` thx; I applied a modified patch. See <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=550978#45> for details.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=547515#c6)  Fedora Update System    2010-01-03 11:55:27 UTC  ``` gif2png-2.5.1-1101.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/gif2png-2.5.1-1101.fc11>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=547515#c7)  Fedora Update System    2010-01-03 11:56:10 UTC  ``` gif2png-2.5.1-1201.fc12 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 12. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/gif2png-2.5.1-1201.fc12>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=547515#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2010-01-04 10:03:02 UTC  ``` When I've seen this update in security updates queue + fortify_source crash reports, I was wondering if we really want to call this security.  Long command line argument overflow is usually not treated as security, even less when fortify_source mitigates to a harmless crash.  However, after closer look, fortify_source does not protect in all cases -- strcpy(file_ext, ...) / sprintf(file_ext, ...) effectively avoids protections.  The overflow is limited to an extension string, so the possibilities to an attacker are limited.  It also seems that the latest patch is not fully addressing the sprintf case though.  Patch makes sure there is enough space in name[] / outname[] for an extra ".EXT\0", but longer than 3 char extensions may be used in certain cases (GIF file contains more images, files .png, .p01, .p02, ..., .p99, .p100, ... may get created).  '- sizeof ".gif" - 9' should be enough to cover all int values.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=547515#c9)  Ken Dreyer    2010-01-05 02:32:04 UTC  ``` I'm still getting a buffer overflow with the latest Koji build (gif2png-2.5.1-1101.fc11.i586.rpm)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=547515#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2010-01-05 08:21:04 UTC  ``` F11 does not have the patch applied correctly.  It is in the CVS, but not mentioned in the .spec.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=547515#c11)  Fedora Update System    2010-01-07 18:48:54 UTC  ``` gif2png-2.5.1-1102.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/gif2png-2.5.1-1102.fc11>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=547515#c12)  Fedora Update System    2010-01-07 18:49:56 UTC  ``` gif2png-2.5.1-1202.fc12 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 12. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/gif2png-2.5.1-1202.fc12>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=547515#c13)  Enrico Scholz    2010-01-07 19:02:10 UTC  ``` I agree that this is probably not a a security issue for fedora because only a very limited number and set of characters (.gif + 0-9 + -) can be placed on stack.  Rest is caught by fortify-check in strcpy().    full-disclosure mentions cgi scripts which call 'gif2png' with user input data as an attack vector which is true for non fortified systems.  So, rating the overflow as a security issue is correct but it has probably no impact on fedora.  I do not know the procedure for such cases but will use 'security' tag.   Btw, thanks for catching the sprintf() case and the missed patch in F-11.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=547515#c14)  Fedora Update System    2010-01-12 23:35:27 UTC  ``` gif2png-2.5.1-1102.fc11 has been pushed to the Fedora 11 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=547515#c15)  Vincent Danen    2010-12-03 21:47:30 UTC  ``` This issue was assigned the name CVE-2009-5018:  <http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/3816/>   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=547515#c16)  Vincent Danen    2011-01-14 17:28:39 UTC  ``` For posterity, MITRE assigned an additional two CVEs here.
