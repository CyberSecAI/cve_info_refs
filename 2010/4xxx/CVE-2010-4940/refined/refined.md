Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2010-4940:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the WAnewsletter v 2.1.2 application. Specifically, the `id` parameter within the `index.php` file is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, including usernames and passwords, as shown in the provided exploit.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** With the extracted credentials, attackers could potentially gain administrative access to the application, leading to further exploitation and compromise of the system.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** The CVSS score suggests a partial impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, meaning the attacker could potentially read, modify, and disrupt access to data and resources to some degree.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the `index.php` file with a manipulated `id` parameter.
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, meaning an attacker can initiate the exploit from any location with network access to the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to have some knowledge of SQL syntax to craft the malicious SQL queries for successful exploitation.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable URL is `http://site/index.php?service=5&id=[SQL Injection]`
*   An example exploit is provided: `http://site/index.php?service=5&id=-4375+UNION+SELECT+1,2,3,concat(user,0x3a,passwd),5+from+wa_admin--`
*   The exploit attempts to use a SQL `UNION SELECT` to extract the username and password from the `wa_admin` table.

**Additional Notes:**

* The content provides a link to download the vulnerable software.
* Multiple references are provided to other security websites, such as Xforce, SecurityFocus, Exploit-DB, and Packet Storm.
* The CVSS Base Score is 7.5/10, indicating a high severity vulnerability.
*  The exploit range is stated as "Remote", attack complexity is "Low", and authentication is "Not required", indicating this vulnerability is easily exploitable remotely by an unauthenticated attacker.
