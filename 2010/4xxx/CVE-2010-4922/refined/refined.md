Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the failure of the "contentAE.asp" script to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the "i" variable. This lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection (CWE-89). The application does not properly validate or sanitize user-provided input before using it in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Compromise of the application:** Attackers can alter SQL queries, potentially gaining control over the application.
- **Access or modification of sensitive data:** Attackers can retrieve or manipulate sensitive data within the database.
- **Exploitation of underlying SQL database vulnerabilities:** Attackers can potentially use the SQL injection to exploit vulnerabilities present in the underlying database system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable "contentAE.asp" script, manipulating the "i" parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
- **Low Attack Complexity:** The attack requires low complexity to perform.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker doesn't need prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- Vulnerable script: `contentAE.asp`
- Vulnerable parameter: `i`
- Example PoC: `http://host/path_to_admin/contentAE.asp?m=edit&i=376+ANY_SQL_HERE`
-  The provided proof of concept demonstrates how an attacker can append SQL code to the "i" parameter.
- The vulnerability is present in Allinta CMS.

**Additional Notes:**
- The risk level is considered low, but the CVSS base score is 7.5/10 with a high exploitability subscore of 10/10.
- The vendor was notified but the vulnerability remains unpatched.
-  The content provides more detail than the typical CVE description by detailing the vulnerable file and the vulnerable parameter.
