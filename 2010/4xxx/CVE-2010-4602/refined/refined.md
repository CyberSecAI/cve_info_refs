Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is improper access control in the IBM Rational ClearQuest Web client. The application does not properly validate user permissions when accessing records via direct URL manipulation (browser bookmarks).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The vulnerability stems from the fact that the application allows users to directly access records by modifying the record ID in the URL. It does not perform adequate permission checks when accessing a record via a modified URL, allowing users to potentially bypass access control.
*   **Insufficient Authorization Checks:** The application fails to verify if the user has the necessary privileges to view a record when accessed through a manipulated URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Information Disclosure:** A restricted user, who should not have access to certain records, can gain access and view sensitive information by manipulating the URL (e.g., via a bookmark) and changing the record ID.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Manipulation:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by manipulating the record ID in a URL obtained from a browser bookmark or by crafting a URL that points to a record they do not have explicit access to.
*   **Browser Bookmarks:** The vulnerability can be exploited using a browser bookmark to change the record number.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to ClearQuest Web Client:** The attacker must have a valid account with access to the ClearQuest Web client.
*   **Basic Understanding of URL Structure:** The attacker needs to understand how to manipulate the record number within a URL.
*   **Knowledge of Target Record ID:** The attacker needs to know or guess the ID of the record they wish to access. This could be obtained from a previous session as an admin or through other means.
