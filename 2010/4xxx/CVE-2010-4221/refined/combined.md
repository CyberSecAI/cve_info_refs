How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

November 2nd, 2010
## ProFTPD TELNET\_IAC Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-10-229ZDI-CAN-925

| CVE ID |  |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 10.0, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [ProFTPD](http://www.proftpd.org) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [FTP Server](http://www.proftpd.org) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['10641']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of ProFTPD. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The flaw exists within the proftpd server component which listens by default on TCP port 21. When reading user input if a TELNET\_IAC escape sequence is encountered the process miscalculates a buffer length counter value allowing a user controlled copy of data to a stack buffer. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the proftpd process. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Patch committed to CVS with accompanying regression test, and backported to1.3.3 branch.<http://bugs.proftpd.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3521> |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2010-09-24 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2010-11-02 - Coordinated public release of advisory |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=3521#c0)  TJ Saunders    2010-10-29 12:15:13 UTC  ``` ZDI-CAN-925: ProFTPD TELNET_IAC Remote Code Execution Vulnerability  -- CVSS ---------------------------------------------------------------- 10, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)  -- ABSTRACT ------------------------------------------------------------  TippingPoint has identified a vulnerability affecting the following  products:      ProFTPD FTP Server  -- VULNERABILITY DETAILS -----------------------------------------------  This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of ProFTPD. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.   The flaw exists within the proftpd server component which listens by default on TCP port 21. When reading user input if a TELNET_IAC escape sequence is encountered the process miscalculates a buffer length counter value allowing a user controlled copy of data to a stack buffer.  A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the proftpd process.  Tested on proftpd-1.3.3a. [Switching to process 31268] 0x0806d498 in pr_netio_telnet_gets (buf=0xbf979ffc 'A' <repeats 200 times>..., buflen=4294963202, in_nstrm=0x97d77e4, out_nstrm=0x97d79f4) at netio.c:1103 1103          *bp++ = cp;  FTP commands are read by function pr_cmd_read() of file src/main.c (line 566).  The function pr_cmd_read() uses a local buffer (line 568):   char buf[PR_DEFAULT_CMD_BUFSZ+1] = {'\0'};  At line 582, pr_cmd_read() calls pr_netio_telnet_gets():   if (pr_netio_telnet_gets(buf, sizeof(buf)-1, [...]  The second parameter of pr_netio_telnet_gets() is "sizeof(buf)-1", so its value is :   sizeof(buf)-1 =   (PR_DEFAULT_CMD_BUFSZ+1)-1 =   PR_DEFAULT_CMD_BUFSZ =          [defined in src/main.c]   PR_TUNABLE_PATH_MAX + 7 =       [defined in include/options.h]   MAXPATHLEN + 7 =                [on Linux, MAXPATHLEN==4096]   4096 + 7 =   4103  The function pr_netio_telnet_gets() is defined in src/netio.c (line 991):   pr_netio_telnet_gets(char *buf, size_t buflen, [...]  We have buflen==4103. It is first decremented, and then each read character decrements it. This is inside a loop which stops when buflen==0, or when a '\n' character is found (line 1039).  However, on line 1073, there is:   buflen--; So, buflen can be decremented by TWO inside the loop. This case occurs because the function processes TELNET_IAC escape characters followed by a TELNET_xyz character.  So, successive buflen values can be :   4103   4102   ...   3   2   1 (here we manage to decrement by TWO, by putting      a TELNET_IAC character at this location)   -1   -2   ... So, the loop never stops because buflen is never zero. The loop will only stop when a '\n' character is found (line 1039).  So, every character between the TELNET_IAC and the '\n' will overflow the stack buffer. This is a classical stack overflow.   -- CREDIT --------------------------------------------------------------  This vulnerability was discovered by:     * Anonymous ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=3521#c1)  TJ Saunders    2010-10-29 12:17:40 UTC  ``` There is no effective workaround to prevent this bug.  At best, admins can use different CommandBufferSize values in their proftpd.conf to avoid having the same default buffer size and thus make it harder for automated scripts, using the same default values.  Thus something like:    CommandBufferSize 1037  or    CommandBufferSize 3983  or other odd but perfectly functional values. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=3521#c2)  TJ Saunders    2010-10-29 12:22:04 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 3436](attachment.cgi?id=3436 "Prevent underflows of the buflen variable to avoid the stack overflow") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=3436&action=edit "Prevent underflows of the buflen variable to avoid the stack overflow") Prevent underflows of the buflen variable to avoid the stack overflow ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=3521#c3)  TJ Saunders    2010-10-29 12:23:31 UTC  ``` Ignore the comments about using CommandBufferSize to attempt to mitigate this vulnerability; they will NOT work.  The CommandBufferSize directive is used on commands read from clients *after* they have been processed by the vulnerable NetIO processing of Telnet characters. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=3521#c4)  TJ Saunders    2010-10-29 12:37:18 UTC  ``` Other considerations for this issue: it affects both FTP and FTPS (FTP over SSL/TLS) connections, but does NOT affect SSH/SFTP/SCP connections (i.e. it does not apply to the mod_sftp module). ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=3521#c5)  TJ Saunders    2010-10-29 13:30:39 UTC  ``` Patch committed to CVS with accompanying regression test, and backported to 1.3.3 branch. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=3521#c6)  TJ Saunders    2010-10-29 18:04:29 UTC  ``` The initial report from TippingPoint did not indicate the range of versions of ProFTPD with this vulnerability.  Inspecting the sources of versions past indicates that this vulnerability has been present since at least proftpd-1.2.0pre10. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=3521#c7)  TJ Saunders    2010-10-29 18:18:24 UTC  ``` Correction:  The initial report from TippingPoint did not indicate the range of versions of ProFTPD with this vulnerability.  Inspecting the sources of versions past indicates that this vulnerability has been present since proftpd-1.3.2rc3.  The vulnerability was inadvertently added as part of the fix for [Bug#3131](show_bug.cgi?id=3131 "CLOSED FIXED - Session process uses 100% CPU after aborted transfer"). ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=3521#c8)  TJ Saunders    2010-11-12 19:35:30 UTC  ``` For future reference, this has been issued a CVE:    <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-4221> ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=3521#c9)  TJ Saunders    2010-11-16 17:14:14 UTC  ``` And the published ZDI advisory for this:    <http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-10-229/> ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=3521#c10)  TJ Saunders    2010-12-18 12:51:31 UTC  ``` Resolved in 1.3.4rc1. ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=3521#c11)  Castro B    2019-06-19 10:32:34 UTC  ``` The CommandBufferSize directive is used on commands read from clients.
