    -  Other malicious actions within the context of a user's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through crafted input via the vulnerable files. This suggests that the attacker needs to interact with MyBB through a web browser by making requests to the `editpost.php`, `member.php`, or `newreply.php` scripts, with malicious code in a parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit content or interact with the MyBB forum via web requests to the vulnerable scripts.

**Additional Notes:**
