```
- Root cause of vulnerability: Stack buffer overflow in the MOXA_ActiveX_SDK.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The PlayFileName() function within the MediaDBPlayback.DLL ActiveX control is vulnerable to a stack buffer overflow. Sending an overly long string to this function can overwrite the stack.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
- Attack vectors: By sending a specially crafted long string to the PlayFileName() function of the vulnerable ActiveX control.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to trigger the execution of the vulnerable ActiveX control (e.g., by hosting it on a malicious web page or by sending a file that uses the control).
