## IntelliCom NetBiter NB100 and NB200 platforms contain multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#114560

Original Release Date: 2011-02-03 | Last Revised: 2011-02-23

---

### Overview

IntelliCom NetBiter products based on the NB100 and NB200 platforms contain multiple vulnerabilities.

### Description

| IntelliCom NetBiter products based on the NB100 and NB200 platforms contain multiple vulnerabilities. A user who has been authenticated at the superadmin level (highest authentication level) has permission to read system files by calling read.cgi with options to read a system file. Local configuration files may be accessed by exploiting a directory traversal vulnerability. This may lead an attacker to research other potential attack vectors. An attacker may also execute arbitrary commands by uploading malicious code.  For additional information see ICS-CERT Advisory [ICSA-10-316-01A](http://www.us-cert.gov/control_systems/pdf/ICSA-10-316-01A.pdf). |

### Impact

| An attacker who is authenticated at the superadmin level exploiting this directory traversal vulnerability could access local configuration files. An attacker may also execute arbitrary commands by uploading malicious code. |
