{
  "CVE-2010-4534": {
    "Description": "The Django administrative interface, django.contrib.admin, supports filtering of displayed lists of objects by fields on the corresponding models, including across database-level relationships. One historically-undocumented and -unofficially-supported feature has been the ability for a user with sufficient knowledge of a model's structure and the format of these lookup arguments to invent useful new filters on the fly by manipulating the querystring. This can be abused to gain access to information outside of an admin user's permissions; for example, an attacker with access to the admin and sufficient knowledge of model structure and relations could construct querystrings which, with repeated use of regular-expression lookups supported by the Django database API, expose sensitive information such as users' password hashes.",
    "Root cause": "The Django administrative interface did not properly validate query string lookups, allowing users with sufficient knowledge of a model's structure to invent new filters and potentially expose sensitive information.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation",
      "Information Leakage",
      "Authorization bypass"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker with admin privileges and knowledge of the model structure can bypass authorization to gain access to sensitive information.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Manipulating the query string parameters in URLs for the Django administrative interface"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Admin access to the Django application",
      "Knowledge of the Django model structure and database relationships"
    ],
    "Additional details": "The vulnerability allowed arbitrary lookups to be inserted via querystrings. The fix now validates that query string lookup arguments specify only fields on the model being viewed, or cross relations which have been explicitly whitelisted."
