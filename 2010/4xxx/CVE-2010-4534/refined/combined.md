How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Security releases issued

Posted by **James Bennett** on Dec. 22, 2010

Today the Django team is issuing multiple releases -- Django 1.2.4,
Django 1.1.3 and Django 1.3 beta 1 -- to remedy two security issues
reported to us. All users of affected versions of Django are urged to
upgrade immediately.

### Information leakage in Django administrative interface

The Django administrative interface, `django.contrib.admin`, supports
filtering of displayed lists of objects by fields on the corresponding
models, including across database-level relationships. This is
implemented by passing lookup arguments in the querystring portion of
the URL, and options on the `ModelAdmin` class allow developers to
specify particular fields or relationships which will generate
automatic links for filtering.

One historically-undocumented and -unofficially-supported feature has
been the ability for a user with sufficient knowledge of a model's
structure and the format of these lookup arguments to invent useful
new filters on the fly by manipulating the querystring.

As reported to us by Adam Baldwin, however, this can be abused to gain
access to information outside of an admin user's permissions; for
example, an attacker with access to the admin and sufficient knowledge
of model structure and relations could construct querystrings which --
with repeated use of regular-expression lookups supported by the
Django database API -- expose sensitive information such as users'
password hashes.

To remedy this, `django.contrib.admin` will now validate that
querystring lookup arguments either specify only fields on the model
being viewed, or cross relations which have been explicitly
whitelisted by the application developer using the pre-existing
mechanism mentioned above. This is backwards-incompatible for any
users relying on the prior ability to insert arbitrary lookups, but as
this "feature" was never documented or supported, we do not consider
it to be an issue for our API-stability policy. The release notes for
Django 1.3 beta 1 -- which will include this change -- will, however,
note this difference from previous Django releases.

### Denial-of-service attack in password-reset mechanism

Django's bundled authentication framework, `django.contrib.auth`, offers
views which allow users to reset a forgotten password. The reset
mechanism involves generating a one-time token composed from the
user's ID, the timestamp of the reset request converted to a base36
integer, and a hash derived from the user's current password hash
(which will change once the reset is complete, thus invalidating the
token).

The code which verifies this token, however, does not validate the
length of the supplied base36 timestamp before attempting to convert
it. An attacker with sufficient knowledge of a site's URL
configuration and the manner in which the reset token is constructed
can, then, craft a request containing an arbitrarily-large (up to the
web server's maximum supported URL length) base36 integer, which
Django will blindly attempt to convert back into a timestamp.

As reported to us by Paul McMillan, the time required to attempt this
conversion on ever-larger numbers will consume significant server
resources, and many such simultaneous requests will result in an
effective denial-of-service attack. Further investigation revealed
that the password-reset code blindly converts base36 in multiple
places.

To remedy this, the `base36_to_int()` function in `django.utils.http` will
now validate the length of its input; on input longer than 13 digits
(sufficient to base36-encode any 64-bit integer), it will now raise
ValueError. Additionally, the default URL patterns for
`django.contrib.auth` will now enforce a maximum length on the relevant
parameters.

### Affected versions

Both of the issues described above are present in the following
currently-supported Django versions:

* Django development trunk
* Django 1.2
* Django 1.1

### Resolution

Patches have been applied to Django trunk, and to the 1.2 and 1.1
release branches, which resolve both issues described above. The
patches may be obtained directly from the appropriate changesets:

* Django trunk: [changeset 15031](http://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/15031) for the admin issue and [changeset 15032](http://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/15032) for the password-token issue.
* Django 1.2: [changeset 15033](http://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/15033) for the admin issue and [changeset 15034](http://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/15034) for the password-token issue.
* Django 1.1: [changeset 15035](http://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/15035) for the admin issue and [changeset 15036](http://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/15036) for the password-token issue.

The following new releases have been issued:

* Django 1.2.4 ([download](https://www.djangoproject.com/m/releases/1.2/Django-1.2.4.tar.gz) | [checksums](https://www.djangoproject.com/m/pgp/Django-1.2.4.checksum.txt))
* Django 1.1.3 ([download](https://www.djangoproject.com/m/releases/1.1/Django-1.1.3.tar.gz) | [checksums](https://www.djangoproject.com/m/pgp/Django-1.1.3.checksum.txt))

Django 1.3 beta 1, which will contain the patch from Django trunk,
will also be issued later today.

### General notes regarding security

As always, we ask that potential security issues be reported via
private email to `security@djangoproject.com`, and not via
Django's Trac instance or the django-developers list

Due to the impending Christmas and New Year's holiday, our normal
process of notifying distributors of Django one week in advance of
security-releated release was shortened somewhat to allow these
releases to be issued before most Django users take their holiday
vacations.

If you are or represent a third-party distributor of Django and did
not receive a notification email from the Django release manager,
please contact `james@b-list.org`.

# python-django 1.1.1-2ubuntu1.2 source package in Ubuntu

## Changelog

```
python-django (1.1.1-2ubuntu1.2) lucid-security; urgency=low

  * SECURITY UPDATE: information leak in admin interface
    - debian/patches/08_security_admin_infoleak.diff: validate querystring
      lookup arguments either specify only fields on the model being viewed,
      or cross relations which have been explicitly whitelisted.
    - CVE-2010-4534
  * SECURITY UPDATE:
    - debian/patches/09_security_pasword_reset_dos.diff: adjust
      base36_to_int() function in django.utils.http will now validate the
      length of its input; on input longer than 13 digits (sufficient to
      base36-encode any 64-bit integer), it will now raise ValueError.
      Additionally, the default URL patterns for django.contrib.auth will now
      enforce a maximum length on the relevant parameters.
    - CVE-2010-4535

# USN-1040-1: Django vulnerabilities

7 January 2011

An attacker could send crafted input to Django and cause it to utilize
too many resources.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 9.10](/security/notices?release=karmic)

## Packages

* [python-django](/security/cves?package=python-django) - High-level Python web development framework

## Details

Adam Baldwin discovered that Django did not properly validate query string

lookups. This could be exploited to provide an information leak to an

attacker with admin privilieges. ([CVE-2010-4534](/security/CVE-2010-4534))

Paul McMillan discovered that Django did not validate the length of the

token used when generating a password reset. An attacker could exploit

this to cause a denial of service via resource exhaustion. ([CVE-2010-4535](/security/CVE-2010-4535))

##### Ubuntu 9.10

* [python-django](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python-django)
  -
  [1.1.1-1ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python-django/1.1.1-1ubuntu1.1)

##### Ubuntu 10.10

* [python-django](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python-django)
  -
  [1.2.3-1ubuntu0.2.10.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python-django/1.2.3-1ubuntu0.2.10.10.1)

  -
  [1.1.1-2ubuntu1.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python-django/1.1.1-2ubuntu1.2)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
