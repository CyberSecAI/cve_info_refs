CVE-2010-4523:

- Root cause of vulnerability: Stack-based buffer overflows occur in OpenSC device drivers when processing crafted serial numbers from specific smart cards (A-Trust ACOS, ACS ACOS5, and STARCOS SPK 2.3).
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Multiple stack-based buffer overflows exist in `card-acos5.c`, `card-atrust-acos.c`, and `card-starcos.c` within the OpenSC library.
- Impact of exploitation: A local attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running `opensc-tool` or `opensc-explorer` binaries.
- Attack vectors: A malicious smart card with a specially crafted serial number is inserted into the system.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: A local attacker needs physical access to the system to insert the malicious smart card.
