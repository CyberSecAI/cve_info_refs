Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2010-4750:

**CVE-2010-4750:** The provided content from Exploit-DB indicates that this CVE is associated with a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The CSRF vulnerability exists because the `admin/libs/ADMIN.php` script fails to properly verify the source of HTTP requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CSRF:** The application does not adequately check if the HTTP request originated from a legitimate user action within the application, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation could lead to a compromise of the application.
*   Theft of cookie-based authentication credentials,
*   Disclosure or modification of sensitive data.
* In the provided Proof-of-Concept (PoC), the CSRF vulnerability is exploited to change member settings, including admin privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   An attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that submits data to the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker tricks a logged-in user into visiting the malicious page, either through phishing or other social engineering techniques.
*   The user's browser automatically submits the form with the attacker's parameters without the user's awareness to the target application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to create and host a malicious HTML page or embed it on a website visited by the victim.
*   The attacker needs to lure a logged-in user of the vulnerable application to visit the malicious page.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated against the vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided content also details multiple XSS vulnerabilities within the same application, but these are not related to CVE-2010-4750.
* The advisory mentions that the vulnerability is not fixed and that the vendor was alerted.
*   The vulnerability is rated as low risk according to the advisory, however, the impact described sounds more like medium risk at least.
