**Vulnerable App:**

```
// source: https://www.securityfocus.com/bid/44301/info
/* known for over a year, fixed in grsec
   bug is due to a bad limit on the max size of the stack for 32bit apps
   on a 64bit OS.   Instead of them being limited to 1/4th of a 32bit
   address space, they're limited to 1/4th of a 64bit address space -- oops!
   in combination with vanilla ASLR, it triggers a BUG() as the stack
   tries to expand around the address space when shifted
   Below mmap_min_addr you say? uh oh! ;)

   Reported to Ted Tso in December 2009
   Linus today (Aug 13 2010) silently fixes tangential issue:
   http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=320b2b8de12698082609ebbc1a17165727f4c893

   The second bug here is that the memory usage explodes within the
   kernel from a single 128k allocation in userland
   The explosion of memory isn't accounted for by any task so it won't
   be terminated by the OOM killer

   curious what actual vuln was involved that they were trying
   to silently fix, as I don't think it's the one below
   clobbering data in a suid app by growing the stack into the mapping
   for the image? ;)  I smell privesc...mumblings of X server/recursion

   ulimit -s unlimited
   ./64bit_dos

   SELinux is here to save us though with its fine-grained controls!
   Wait, it doesn't?
   Clearly the solution is to throw a buggy KVM on top of it
   Not enough?  Ok, we'll throw in an extra SELinux, that'll really
   throw those hackers off when they use the same exact exploit on the
   host as they do on the guest!
   COMMON CRITERIA HERE I COME!

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=625688#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-08-20 07:05:24 UTC  ``` Description of problem: This issue was mentioned in <http://grsecurity.net/~spender/64bit_dos.c>. Written in the comments: "The second bug here is that the memory usage explodes within the kernel from a single 128k allocation in userland The explosion of memory isn't accounted for by any task so it won't be terminated by the OOM killer."  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Brad Spengler for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=625688#c7)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-09-01 04:37:56 UTC  ``` Two issues here, the BUG_ON condition and the OOM dodging issue.  Roland proposed the solution to the BUG_ON issue with <http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/8/30/463> as opposed to Kee's <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2010/08/27/1>.  And Motohiro-san proposed <http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/8/29/206> for the OOM dodging issue, but no feedback yet.  re: reproducer, Alexander noted <http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/8/30/378>.  So I see two possible two CVE assignments.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=625688#c8)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-09-01 04:39:24 UTC  ``` Introduced by upstream commit b6a2fea39318e43fee84fa7b0b90d68bed92d2ba.  For my reference, [bug 443659](show_bug.cgi?id=443659) (rhel-5).   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=625688#c14)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-10-21 03:57:08 UTC  ``` The top-level bug for the BUG_ON issue is [bug 645222](show_bug.cgi?id=645222 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-3858 kernel: setup_arg_pages: diagnose excessive argument size"). This bug will be used to address the OOM dodging issue.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=625688#c15)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-10-25 03:50:45 UTC  ``` Update: <http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/10/24/207>   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=625688#c16)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-12-01 02:05:56 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #15](show_bug.cgi?id=625688#c15)) > Update: > <http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/10/24/207>  <http://linux.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Kernel/2010-11/msg13278.html>   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=625688#c17)  Danny Feng    2010-12-01 02:33:18 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #16](show_bug.cgi?id=625688#c16)) > (In reply to [comment #15](show_bug.cgi?id=625688#c15)) > > Update: > > <http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/10/24/207> >  > <http://linux.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Kernel/2010-11/msg13278.html>  upstream commit 3c77f845722158206a7209c45ccddc264d19319c   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=625688#c20)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-01-13 21:10:37 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2011:0017 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0017.html>   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=625688#c21)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-01-14 09:02:34 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2011:0017 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0017.html>   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=625688#c22)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-02-22 17:38:30 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:0283 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0283.html>   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=625688#c25)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-09-12 19:44:48 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-6 v.2  Via RHSA-2011:1253 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1253.html>   ``` |  |

Message-ID: <4CE9FD0E.1070502@redhat.com>
Date: Mon, 22 Nov 2010 13:18:06 +0800

Subject: CVE request: kernel: mm: mem allocated invisible to oom_kill() when
 not attached to any threads

This is the OOM dodging issue that can be triggered with Brad's
reproducer at <http://grsecurity.net/~spender/64bit_dos.c>. Written
in the comments: "The second bug here is that the memory usage explodes
within the kernel from a single 128k allocation in userland The
explosion of memory isn't accounted for by any task so it won't be
terminated by the OOM killer."

I don't recall seeing a CVE name assigned to this, so please assign one.
Upstream is still attempting to fix this.

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=625688#c0>

Thanks, Eugene

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
