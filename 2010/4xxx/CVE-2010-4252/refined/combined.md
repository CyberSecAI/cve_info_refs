Here are the details from the Slackware 13.1 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ patches/packages/openssl-0.9.8q-i486-1_slack13.1.txz:  Upgraded.   This OpenSSL update contains some security related bugfixes.   For more information, see the included CHANGES and NEWS files, and:     http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20101202.txt     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-4180     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-4252   (* Security fix *) patches/packages/openssl-solibs-0.9.8q-i486-1_slack13.1.txz:  Upgraded.   (* Security fix *) +--------------------------+   Where to find the new packages: +-----------------------------+  HINT:  Getting slow download speeds from ftp.slackware.com? Give slackware.osuosl.org a try.  This is another primary FTP site for Slackware that can be considerably faster than downloading directly from ftp.slackware.com.  Thanks to the friendly folks at the OSU Open Source Lab (http://osuosl.org) for donating additional FTP and rsync hosting to the Slackware project!  :-)  Also see the "Get Slack" section on http://slackware.com for additional mirror sites near you.

Session Key Retrieval in J-PAKE Implementations of OpenSSL and OpenSSH

S´ebastien Martini – seb@dbzteam.org

September 12, 2010

1 Description

This issue aﬀects the implementations of J-PAKE [1] in OpenSSL [2] and OpenSSH [3]. These
implementations referred as experimental [4, 5] and work-in-progress [5], both contain the same
ﬂaw, namely, there aren’t adequately verifying the public parameters received from untrusted
parties. These parameters must be reduced modulo p in order to prevent an attacker to bypass
important non-modular checks. This deﬁciency may enable an attacker not knowing the secret
password to conﬁne the computations of her victim into a small subgroup [6] eventually leading
her to always derive her session key from the value K = 1. Like J-PAKE, this issue is symmetric,
meaning that in the usual client/server model, the attacker could be a client trying to authenticate
to a server, or a server trying to impersonate another server to an honest client.

2 Modiﬁed Protocol Rounds

Eve, in order to perform her attack, modiﬁes the rounds 1 and 2 of the original protocol (see [1]
section 3) to send to her victim Alice carefully selected values instead of the randomly chosen
ephemeral ones.

− Round 1’: Eve randomly selects x1 exactly like in the original ﬁrst round, then she picks
x2 = 0 and gx2 = p + 1 and calculates a knowledge proof of 0 using the term gx2 = p + 1 in
the hash computation. She then sends out these values to Alice.

− Round 2’: Eve selects B = 1 along with a knowledge proof of zero and sends out these

values to Alice.

Alice follows the original protocol but mistakenly does not reduce gx2 mod p thus both parties
validate every steps of the protocol. Which eventually lead Eve and Alice to invariably share the
same value K = 1.

3 Remarks

3.1 OpenSSH

The value of x1 in OpenSSH is required to be diﬀerent than zero and the value of B must be
strictly greater than one. Hence, round 2’ must be modiﬁed to take the value of a congruent of
1 mod p diﬀerent than 1.

3.2 SRP

[7] demonstrated the eﬀective need for validating SRP [8] input values. Hence, this issue may also
apply to uncareful SRP implementations using non-modular veriﬁcations.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=659297#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2010-12-02 13:01:16 UTC  ``` Sébastien Martini discovered a flaw in the OpenSSL's implementation of the J-PAKE authentication protocol.  OpenSSL preformed insufficient validation of the public parameters received from the untrusted party, which could use this flaw to make J-PAKE protocol generate predictable session key.  Hence an attacker could use this implementation flaw to successfully authenticate (i.e. prove knowledge of the shared secret) to the peer, usually server.  Sébastien Martini paper describing this flaw, as well as proof of concept code can be found in the following github repository:   <https://github.com/seb-m/jpake>  OpenSSL upstream fix for the issue, which should be included in version 0.9.8q and 1.0.0c:   <http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=20098>  Note: J-PAKE implementation is considered experimental upstream and is not enabled by default.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=659297#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2010-12-02 13:04:41 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 464242](attachment.cgi?id=464242&action=diff "Reproducer") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=464242&action=edit "Reproducer") Reproducer  Sébastien Martini reproducer.  Source: <https://github.com/seb-m/jpake/tree/master/openssl-jpake/>  Git repository provides couple of files that should replace original files in openssl 1.0.0a that are needed to build modified client exploiting this flaw.  This attachment contains a diff between vanilla 1.0.0a and 1.0.0a with Sébastien's modifications applied.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=659297#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2010-12-02 13:06:18 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=659297#c0)) > Note: J-PAKE implementation is considered experimental upstream and is not > enabled by default.  J-PAKE is not enabled in Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora OpenSSL packages either.  Statement:  Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of openssl as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, or 6.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=659297#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2010-12-02 13:10:20 UTC  ``` Same flaws was reported for OpenSSH J-PAKE implementation too and fixed in:  <http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/usr.bin/ssh/jpake.c#rev1.5>  As with OpenSSL, OpenSSH code is experimental and not enabled by default or in RHEL / Fedora builds.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=659297#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2010-12-02 20:10:56 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=659297#c0)) > OpenSSL upstream fix for the issue, which should be included in version 0.9.8q > and 1.0.0c: >   <http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=20098>  Upstream security advisory:   <http://openssl.org/news/secadv_20101202.txt>   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
