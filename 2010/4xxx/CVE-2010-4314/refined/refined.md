Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation within the Novell iPrint Client browser plugin. Specifically, the plugin doesn't verify the length of parameter names passed via `<embed>` tags before copying them to a stack buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is a stack buffer overflow vulnerability. The plugin copies parameter names without checking their length, leading to a potential overwrite of the stack when the name is too long.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** Insufficient input sanitization or length validation is the primary weakness.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. This occurs in the security context of the user who is running the browser. This could lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Web Pages:** The attack vector involves luring a user to visit a specially crafted web page. The malicious page would contain `<embed>` tags with excessively long parameter names, triggering the overflow.
- **Browser Plugin:** The Novell iPrint Client browser plugin is the vulnerable component that is exploited.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Position:** The attacker can be remote since the vulnerability is exploited by a user visiting a webpage.
- **Knowledge of iPrint Plugin:** The attacker needs knowledge of the iPrint plugin and its parsing of the `<embed>` tag parameters.
- **Ability to Serve Web Content:** The attacker needs to be able to serve web content to the target user.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided text explicitly mentions "EIP can be overwritten allowing code execution." EIP (Extended Instruction Pointer) is a key register in x86 architecture and overwriting it is a classic technique used in buffer overflow exploitation to redirect program execution to attacker-controlled code.
- The vulnerability is fixed in "iPrint Client for Windows XP/Vista/Win7 5.42".
