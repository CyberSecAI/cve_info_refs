Long command line argument overflow is usually not treated as security, even less when fortify_source mitigates to a harmless crash.  However, after closer look, fortify_source does not protect in all cases -- strcpy(file_ext, ...) / sprintf(file_ext, ...) effectively avoids protections.  The overflow is limited to an extension string, so the possibilities to an attacker are limited.  It also seems that the latest patch is not fully addressing the sprintf case though.  Patch makes sure there is enough space in name[] / outname[] for an extra ".EXT\0", but longer than 3 char extensions may be used in certain cases (GIF file contains more images, files .png, .p01, .p02, ..., .p99, .p100, ... may get created).  '- sizeof ".gif" - 9' should be enough to cover all int values.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=547515#c9)  Ken Dreyer    2010-01-05 02:32:04 UTC  ``` I'm still getting a buffer overflow with the latest Koji build (gif2png-2.5.1-1101.fc11.i586.rpm)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=547515#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2010-01-05 08:21:04 UTC  ``` F11 does not have the patch applied correctly.

Rest is caught by fortify-check in strcpy().    full-disclosure mentions cgi scripts which call 'gif2png' with user input data as an attack vector which is true for non fortified systems.  So, rating the overflow as a security issue is correct but it has probably no impact on fedora.  I do not know the procedure for such cases but will use 'security' tag.   Btw, thanks for catching the sprintf() case and the missed patch in F-11.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=547515#c14)  Fedora Update System    2010-01-12 23:35:27 UTC  ``` gif2png-2.5.1-1102.fc11 has been pushed to the Fedora 11 stable repository.

# gif2png: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **201101-01**

gif2png contains a stack overflow vulnerability when parsing command line
arguments.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-gfx/gif2png** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.5.1-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.5.1-r1** |

### Background

gif2png is a command line program that converts image files from the
Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) format to the Portable Network
Graphics (PNG) format.

### Description

gif2png contains a command line parsing vulnerability that may result
in a stack overflow due to an unexpectedly long input filename.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted
image, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the application, or a Denial of Service.
Note that applications relying on gif2png to process images can also
trigger the vulnerability.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All gif2png users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/gif2png-2.5.1-r1"
```

# gif2png: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201203-15**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in gif2png, the worst of
which might allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-gfx/gif2png** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.5.8** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.5.8** |

### Background

gif2png converts images from GIF format to PNG format.

### Description

Two vulnerabilities have been found in gif2png:

* A boundary error in gif2png.c could cause a buffer overflow
  (CVE-2010-4694).
* The patch for CVE-2009-5018 causes gif2png to truncate GIF pathnames
  (CVE-2010-4695).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted GIF
file, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code, a Denial of
Service condition, or the creation of PNG files in unintended
directories.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All gif2png users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/gif2png-2.5.8"

```

| [Description](#c0)  Tim Sammut (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2010-11-23 05:45:06 UTC  ``` From the Secunia advisory at <http://secunia.com/advisories/42339/>:   DESCRIPTION: Fedora has issued an update for gif2png. This fixes a vulnerability, which can be exploited by malicious people to potentially compromise a vulnerable system.  The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error when processing overly long command line arguments. This can be exploited to e.g. cause a stack-based buffer overflow by passing specially crafted filenames to the application.   There is a patch at <http://cvs.fedoraproject.org/viewvc/rpms/gif2png/devel/gif2png-overflow.patch?revision=HEAD&root=extras&view=markup>.  If I read the patch correctly, upstream's 2.5.3 is still vulnerable. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tim Sammut (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2010-11-23 05:46:40 UTC  ``` Rating B2 since there appears to be many web applications using this app; and [ebuild] since we have a patch for 2.5.3. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Markus Meier   gentoo-dev  2010-12-03 09:41:58 UTC  ``` *gif2png-2.5.1-r1 (03 Dec 2010)    03 Dec 2010; Markus Meier <maekke@gentoo.org> +gif2png-2.5.1-r1.ebuild,   +files/gif2png-2.5.1-overflow.patch:   fix overflow [bug #346501](show_bug.cgi?id=346501 "RESOLVED FIXED - <media-gfx/gif2png-2.5.1-r1: Command Line Stack Overflow (CVE-2009-5018)") ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Tim Sammut (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2010-12-03 14:40:31 UTC  ``` Arches, please test and mark stable: =media-gfx/gif2png-2.5.1-r1 Target keywords : "amd64 ppc ppc64 sparc x86"  ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  David Abbott (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2010-12-03 21:42:37 UTC  ``` Archtested on x86: Everything fine ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Paweł Hajdan, Jr. (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2010-12-04 09:39:36 UTC  ``` x86 stable, thanks David ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Raúl Porcel (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2010-12-04 17:30:17 UTC  ``` sparc stable ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2010-12-04 19:32:09 UTC  ``` amd64 ok ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Markos Chandras (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2010-12-05 16:18:42 UTC  ``` amd64 done.

How could this possibly be exploited?  If you can trick a user into
running gif2png [exploit payload], then that user has already lost.

It was reported that some CGI scripts/etc use it automatically so by
using a long file name it may be possible.

Personally I'm not worried but Debian/Fedora have fixed it as a
security issue so if that is the case a CVE would be nice for tracking
purposes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: gif2png: Command line buffer overflow
Date: Wed, 14 Oct 2009 18:30:31 +0300
```
Package: gif2png
Version: 2.5.1-3
Severity: normal

gif2png is prone to a command line buffer overflow since there is an
strcpy(3) call that fails to bounds-check user-supplied data before copying
them to a fixed size buffer.  Here is a transcript:

[argp@hegel /tmp]$ gif2png `python -c 'print "A"*2048'`
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
[argp@hegel /tmp]$ gdb -q gif2png -c core

The bug is located at file gif2png.c, line number 901
(strcpy(name, argv[i])) where name is a fixed size char array.  This may
have security repercussions if gif2png is configured as a handler for
other applications that can pass user-supplied filenames as command line
input to gif2png (e.g. from a CGI or other).

Hi Eric,

I'm the maintainer of Gif2png's Debian package.

A Debian GNU/Linux user had reported a bug describe below.
Could you please have a look at it and fix it upstream?

Hi Michael,

> It is claimed that 2.5.2-1 is still affected by this issue [0].

Please have a look on package changelog:
* Added 10_fix_gif2png_c.dpatch, closes: #[550978](bugreport.cgi?bug=550978)

Because upstream didn't answer my bug forwarding, I added a fix for this
issue as a dpatch in the package by myself.

Afterwards I checked with the suggested exploit:
--------------------8<---------------------------------------8<------------------------
es@neo:~$ gif2png `python -c 'print "A"*2048'`
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA: File name too long

ok, i just wanted to see if there was any validity to the full
disclosure claims.  they said they tested against 2.5.2-1, but they
very well could have been mistaken.  looks like this can be safely
closed.

Hi,

I am the Fedora maintainer of gif2png and think that the supplied patch
is incomplete.  In main(), there is done

which could still overflow 'name'.  I think that

  <http://cvs.fedoraproject.org/viewvc/rpms/gif2png/devel/gif2png-overflow.patch?revision=HEAD&root=extras&view=markup>

solves the issue better. It omits the changes in processfile() because
main() guarantees that 'fname' is short enough.

FWIW, 2.5.2 *is* affected; the -ENAMETOOLONG comes from the open(2)
call.  Applying a modified exploit like

  gif2png `perl -e "print '/' x 1024"`/a

still triggers the issue.

But processfile() will remain insecure.
I will adapt my patch with your suggestions.

fwiw, I changed my patch to abort/fail when filename length exceeds a
certain size.  That's better than the current strncpy() stuff which
might cause to process a different file than this what was given (and
perhaps validated) by the caller.

does not matter... it is called from main() only which does all the
range checking.

Adjust the '1024'; on Fedora/RHEL not the buffer overflow caused the
crash but the FORTIFY_SORUCE checks.

$ gif2png `perl -e "print '/' x 1024"`/a

Subject: CVE Request: gif2png: command-line buffer overflow problem

This is from 2009 but doesn't appear to have a CVE (no "gif2png" in
the CVE database).

Sources:
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=547515>
<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=550978>
<http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2009-December/072009.html>

Description:
A buffer overflow in gif2png 2.5.3 and earlier allows an attacker to
execute arbitrary code via a long command line argument passed to the
gif2png binary.

It was first claimed that it was fixed in 2.5.2 but it is reported
that it isn't fixed, I tested 2.5.3 and it still seg faults the same
way as 2.5.2 so it would appear it was never fixed, as the software
was last updated in 2005 I guess this one never gets fixed.

Subject: Re: CVE Request: gif2png: command-line buffer overflow
 problem

I'm typically uncomfortable assigning CVEs for such issues, since this
makes the distinction between bugs and vulnerabilities even fuzzier than
they already are, and potentially creates a "snowball effect" where
suddenly CVE sets a precedent and inadvertently grants legitimacy to large
numbers of issues that are of very little security concern to most
consumers.

However, when there are common usage scenarios in which the product is
used that produce a vulnerability, these have been given CVEs in the past.
(Non-exploitable browser crashers kind of fall under this reasoning,
because of the common usage scenarios where (1) users will click on links,
and (2) users will have multiple tabs/windows/sessions open, so a
browser-ending crash will affect those sessions.)

That's a long way of saying to use CVE-2009-5018 for this issue.
