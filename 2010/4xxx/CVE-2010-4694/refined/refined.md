{
  "CVE-2010-4694": {
    "Description": "Buffer overflow in gif2png.c in gif2png 2.5.3 and earlier might allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or have unspecified other impact via a GIF file that contains many images, leading to long extensions such as .p100 for PNG output files, as demonstrated by a CGI program that launches gif2png, a different vulnerability than CVE-2009-5018.",
    "Root cause": "A buffer overflow occurs when processing a GIF file with many images, leading to long extensions for the output PNG files, due to insufficient bounds checking when creating output filenames.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Insufficient Bounds Checking"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (application crash) or potentially other unspecified impacts.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Crafted GIF file with many images"
    ],
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to craft a malicious GIF file and entice a user or application to process the crafted file using `gif2png`. The vulnerability is triggered when `gif2png` attempts to create PNG output files, leading to a buffer overflow via a long filename extension."
