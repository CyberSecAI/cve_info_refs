The vulnerability occurs because the ipsmd component blindly copies user-supplied data into a fixed-length stack buffer while handling LPR opcodes. This can be exploited by a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the `iprint` user. The vulnerability is present in Novell iPrint for Linux Open Enterprise Server 2 SP2 and SP3."
