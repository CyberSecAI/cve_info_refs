Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2010-4992

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The Joomla! Component PaymentsPlus 2.1.5 is vulnerable to Blind SQL Injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Blind SQL Injection (BSQLi):** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code. The "Blind" part of the vulnerability means the attacker doesn't directly see the results of the queries, but can infer the results through other means such as time delays.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database. This could include reading sensitive data, modifying data, or potentially gaining control of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is accessible through the HTTP GET parameter "type" in the URL.
    `http://server/games/gambling/add.html?type=[BSQLi]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The exploit is noted as "0day no more", suggesting that it was a previously unknown vulnerability that was disclosed at the time.
*   The provided URL `http://server/games/gambling/add.html?type=[BSQLi]` is a demo URL and the `[BSQLi]` placeholder shows where the malicious SQL code should be inserted by the attacker.
