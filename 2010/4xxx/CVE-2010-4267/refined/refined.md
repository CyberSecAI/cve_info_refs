{
  "CVE-2010-4267": {
    "Root cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the SNMP discovery code of the HP Linux Printing and Imaging System (HPLIP). Specifically, the `hpmud_get_pml()` function in pml.c has a boundary error.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can send malicious SNMP replies to trigger the buffer overflow in HPLIP tools. This can lead to a crash of the affected tools or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the tool.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending crafted SNMP responses to vulnerable HPLIP tools"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted SNMP responses to the machine running the vulnerable HPLIP tools. This could be achieved via a network connection or by having a malicious SNMP device responding to the HPLIP device discovery requests."
