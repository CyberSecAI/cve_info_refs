1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- mysql
- local users could delete data files for tables of other users
(CVE-2010-1626).
- authenticated users could gather information for tables they
should not have access to (CVE-2010-1849)
- authenticated users could crash mysqld (CVE-2010-3683,
CVE-2010-3681, CVE-2010-1848)
- authenticated users could bypass intended access restrictions
(CVE-2008-7247, CVE-2009-4030)
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1,
openSUSE 11.2
- dhcp
ISC DHCP can be crashed with a single dhcpv6 packet.
CVE-2010-3611 has been assigned to this issue.
Additionally a dhcrelay crash when receiving packets on interfaces
without assigned IPv4 address has been fixed as well as an infinite
loop in dhcpd.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3
- monotone
Remote attackers could crash a monotone server via an empty argument to
the 'mtn' command (CVE-2010-4098).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3
- moodle
This update of moodle fixes:
- CVE-2010-4207: CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.3 (MEDIUM)
Cross-site scripting vulnerability in the Flash component infrastructure
in YUI allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via
charts/assets/charts.swf.
- CVE-2010-4208: CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.3 (MEDIUM)
Cross-site scripting vulnerability in the Flash component infrastructure
in YUI allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via
uploader/assets/uploader.swf.
- CVE-2010-4209: CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.3 (MEDIUM)
Cross-site scripting vulnerability in the Flash component infrastructure
in YUI allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via
swfstore/swfstore.swf.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1
- openssl/libopenssl-devel
Specially crafted responses from SSL servers could cause a double-free bug
in openssl's client implementation. Therefore a malicious SSL servers could
crash client-side code that uses the openssl library for its SSL connection.
(CVE-2010-2939: CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.3 (MEDIUM))

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Sun May 4 09:55:54 UTC 2014
1.1 release.
Changes
- '\_MTN/wanted-testresults' must now have 1 hex-encoded
signing key hash in lowercase per line.
New features
- 'automate atttributes' now also works without a workspace
and returns the attributes for a specific file from the
revision's manifest
- New 'erase\_descendants' automate command which returns all
input revisions, except those that are a descendant of
another revision in the input.
- New 'min(A)' selector is now available which returns all
revisions selected by A which are not descendants of other
revisions selected by A.
- New 'not(A)' selector is now available which returns all
revisions not selected by 'A'.
- All certs for a revision are now output by 'mtn log' with
'suspend', 'testresult', and custom certs placed under a
a new 'Other certs' heading.
- New conflict 'dropped/modified' allows explicitly resolving
the case of a file that is dropped on one side of a merge,
and modified on the other. Previously, the modifications
were always lost; now you have the option of re-adding the
file with the modifications during merge conflict
resolution.
- New attribute 'mtn:resolve\_conflict' allows specifying a
persistent 'drop' conflict resolution for a dropped/modified
conflict. This is useful in the case where the conflict will
occur again in the future, for example when a file that is
maintained in an upstream branch is not needed, and
therefore dropped, in a local branch.
Bugs fixed
- Monotone now compiles against Botan 1.10.x (as well as most of
the testing releases in 1.9.y).
- Struct file\_handle got renamed to avoid clash with newer glibc's
fcntl.h.
- Monotone now compiles just fine with gcc's option
"-Werror=format-security."
- Fixed renaming across devices, for example if parts of the
workspace are on NFS.
- Fixed recursive file removal on Solaris.
- Fixed a failure to revert some files when inodeprints is
enabled.
- Fix an early abort in netsync on Windows, which caused
problems transferring large files.
- Work around a 64-bit issue with mktime on Mac OS X for dates
in 1901 and before.
- Allow an ssh\_agent socket path including dashes.
- Monotone now works with Lua 5.2, even if it doesn't have
backwards-compatibility compiled in.
- Various fixes for compatibility with newer boost versions.
- mtn add and mtn list are now more consistent in their use of
--recursive and --unknown options.
- Produce a meaningful error message when trying to disapprove a
root.
- Allow monotone to compile on platforms where MAXPATHLEN isn't
defined (i.e. GNU/Hurd).
- Allow monotone to compile on C++11-enabled g++ and clang++.
- Allow the test suite to run on systems behind a broken DNS
resolver and in cases where names cannot be resolved at all.
- Allow the test suite to run from directories containing
spaces and lots of other minor tweaks to the test suite
making its results more reliable.
Internal
- The performance and memory usage of regular expressions has
been improved throughout. This affects any use of the
".mtn-ignore" file such as "mtn ls unknown" and "mtn add",
and any calls to "regex.search" in Lua hooks.
Other
- 'mtn diff' now outputs old and new revision IDs in the diff
header when both are specified.
- Additional Vim syntax files and an output colorization script
in contrib.
Sat Mar 26 10:53:47 UTC 2011
1.0 release.
Changes
- The database scheme was changed; please execute 'mtn db migrate'
on all your local and remote databases.
- In 'mtn conflicts resolve\_first interactive', the result
file name now defaults to \_MTN/resolutions/.
(fixes monotone issue 103)
- The French monotone translation has been updated and is
now part of the main distribution again. Many thanks to
Steve Petruzzello  for the outstanding
work!
- get\_netsync\_(read|write)\_permitted have been extended to not
only read the files read-permissions and write-permissions,
but also the files in the subdirectories read-permissions.d
and write-permissions.d.
- monotone now also tracks the workspaces of databases which
do not reside in a "managed" location.
- automate now resets the locale to "POSIX" internally. This
means that all scripts can expect the same untranslated
messages from mtn automate, regardless of the locale of the
calling process.
- The hook 'get\_netsync\_key' has been split up into two separate
hooks, one for client usage ('get\_netsync\_client\_key', with
the same arguments as the original 'get\_netsync\_key') and one
for server usage ('get\_netsync\_server\_key', with a single table
argument containing all the given '--bind' options). Please
review your custom hooks accordingly.
- Short options ('-b', '-d', ...) are no longer completed. This
fixes an invariant failure originating from wrong option usage.
(closes monotone issue 141)
New Features
- 'mtn conflicts store' now outputs a count of the conflicts,
and the name of the conflicts file.
(fixes monotone issue 108)
- New 'mtn list workspaces' command which outputs all the
known workspaces for a specific database.
(closes monotone issue 129)
Bugs fixed
- The internal line merger will actually preserve your line
endings now, instead of changing everything to "\n".
- Improved the help and fixed the argument indexing in
'conflicts resolve\_first' (fixes monotone issue 101)
- A regression from 0.48 prevented monotone from ordering the
diff output of individual files alphabetically.
(fixes monotone issue 102)
- 'mtn privkey' did not recognize private keys solely available
in the key store. This has been fixed.
- Added compatibility with Botan 1.9.9 and newer.
(fixes monotone issue 104)
- 'mtn pull' and 'mtn sync' would always say that your workspace
has not been updated. Now, it only does that when you used
the '--update' option and there were no updates.
(fixes monotone issue 106)
- 'mtn automate remote' and 'mtn automate remote\_stdio' now use
a given database given by an alias to read, store and validate
a remote server's key fingerprint (fixes monotone issue 95)
- monotone gives a proper error message now if a netsync URI
with the 'mtn' scheme misses the required host part
(fixes monotone issue 110)
- Whenever a binary file was removed and one would try to get
a diff using mtn diff, it would report that "/dev/null is
binary". This has been changed to it reports the actual
name of the removed file instead.
(fixes monotone issue 111)
- monotone no longer wrongly falls back on a :memory: database
when no database option is given. It also prints out an
informational message for commands like 'setup' and 'clone'
that fall back on the configured default database, again,
if no database is specified for these commands.
(fixes monotone issue 113)
- If 'mtn serve' is called with one or more '--bind' options,
then the arguments to these options can now be specified
again as follows:
''
to listen to IP or host on the default port
':'
to listen to IP or host on the specified port - or
':'
to listen on all interfaces on the specified port
(fixes monotone issue 119)
- monotone no longer enforces ".mtn" as file extension for
managed databases. A new Lua hook, get\_default\_database\_glob(),
is used instead to determine a pattern which matches
accepted database filenames and this pattern by default
accept files ending with both, ".mtn" and ".db".
(fixes monotone issue 128)
- monotone now gives a proper error message when an incomplete
or partial identifier contains non-hex digits.
(fixes monotone issue 143)
- Performance of "mtn ls changed" has been improved and is now
comparable to "mtn status". (fixes monotone issue 120)
Internal
- The source tree has been reorganized. Sources, tests and
documentation now reside in specific directories and many
smaller improvements in terms of source code cleanup,
developer documentation and general build infrastructure
accompany this big change.
Other
- Added a new directory extra/, which contains monotone hooks and
related scripts that have been shown to work. Most of these get
installed, usually somewhere under $(prefix)/share/monotone.
Please read extra/README for further information.
- Added the mtn-cleanup Perl script that returns a workspace to its
pristine state with the minimum amount of change. This script is
in the extra/bin directory.
Sun Oct 31 21:51:16 UTC 2010
0.99.1 release.
Bugs fixed
- monotone crashed on x86\_64 when a netsync action required
the parsing of an URL. This has been fixed.
(closes monotone issue 100)
- monotone's automation interface version was reported wrongly
as 12.1, where it should have been 13.0.
Thu Oct 28 21:07:18 UTC 2010
0.99 release.
Changes
- The database scheme was changed; please execute 'mtn db migrate'
on all your local and remote databases.
- Normal and automate sync, push, and pull now take a
--dry-run option; no data is transferred, but the connection
is made and a summary of what would be transferred is
output.
- The changelog editor format was simplified; user entered text
is back at the top of file and the instructions have been reduced.
The edited text is saved now even if a commit is canceled.
- Selectors are much more powerful now and selector functions to
calculate common sets of revisions have been introduced.
The characters '(', ')', and ';' need to be quoted if mean literally
(just like '/') because of this. See section 3.2 in the documentation
for details.
(fixes monotone bug #18302).
- The SERVER [BRANCH] call syntax for network-related commands
has been deprecated in favour of the existing, universal
URI syntax. Additionally, file:// and ssh:// URIs are now
parsed for include and exclude patterns just as the native
mtn:// URIs.
The possibility to specify include patterns by using
'include=' and exclude patterns by using 'exclude='
in the query string has been removed. Patterns are separated
by ';' and will be treated as include patterns unless prefixed
with '-'. Where you could previously specify
'mtn://host/?include=foo,exclude=bar', you would now give
'mtn://host/?foo;-bar' instead.
The URI parser was made a bit more standards compliant and
treats the scheme and host in a case insensitive manner.
The path and query parts are now automatically URL-decoded.
We deviate from RFC 3986 however by recognizing the authority
part in scheme-less URLs, where the standard would force us
to recognize a path instead. For example, for the URL
'code.monotone.ca/monotone'
we'd normally parse 'code.monotone.ca/monotone' as path, but our
implementation parses 'code.monotone.ca' as authority and
'/monotone' as path, so you are not forced to type 'mtn://' on
command line, just as you are not forced to type 'http://' in
your browser. Monotone's native scheme / protocol 'mtn' is by
the way set as default in cases like this.
The format for the server part of the 'default-server',
'known-server', 'server-include' and 'server-exclude'
database variables has been changed and now always includes
the complete (normalized) URI resource, consisting of the
used protocol, user, host, port and path parts. Older entries
in existing databases which do not match the new format are
preserved and not changed by monotone.
Please check the manual section 5.3 for more details on the
URI syntax.
- Naturally, the 'clone' command now also accepts mtn:// URIs,
though the use of branch globs is forbidden unless a branch is
specified separately with the new --branch option.
To avoid confusion with an existing workspace, clone no longer
looks for and loads the options of such a workspace, therefor
it now also falls back to the configured default database and
no longer to the database used in the workspace if no explicit
database is given.
- Server defaults for netsync operations are now only saved if
the exchange was successful. The progress messages which have
been issued for this previously have been removed, since they
would come up now unexpectedly and would clutter the output of
commands such as 'clone', 'automate remote' and
'automate remote\_stdio'.
- The following characters have been deprecated in branch names
?,;\*%+{}[]!^
as they denote either meta characters in monotone's URI syntax
or are used in globs to resolve branch patterns.
Furthermore, branch names should no longer start with a dash
(-), since this character is used to denote an exclude pattern
in the aforementioned URI syntax.
monotone warns on the creation of branches which violate these
restrictions and gives further directions.
- The 'cert' command can now operate on multiple revisions at once.
- The command 'db kill\_rev\_locally' has been renamed to
'local kill\_revision', and 'db kill\_tag\_locally' and
'db kill\_branch\_certs\_locally' have been replaced with a more
flexible command 'local kill\_certs'.
- The 'import' command now keeps the created bookkeeping root if
--dry-run is not specified. This makes it possible to re-use
the import directory as workspace and is also more closely
to what our documentation states, when it says that import
is basically "setup with a twist".
- On Win32 native, the option '--no-format-dates' which disables
the localized date format, is now the default for 'commit', since
dates are not parseable on Win32 native.
- The automate commands sync, push, and pull now output information
about each transferred revision, cert and key, in basic\_io format.
- monotone no longer passes syntactically correct, but non-existent
revision ids through the selector machinery. The most visible
place for this change is 'automate select', which no longer
echoes every possible 40 hex-byte string.
- The 'automate genkey' command has been renamed to
'automate generate\_key'
New features
- Options can now be overridden; you can specify '--no-unknown
--unknown' on the command line and effectively get back the original
state in the application. Similarly, you can specify '--no-unknown'
in the 'get\_default\_command\_options' hook and then override that
with '--unknown' on the command line.
- New global options:
--no-ignore-suspend-certs undo previous --ignore-suspend-certs
--use-default-key undo previous --key
--allow-default-confdir undo previous --no-default-confdir
--allow-workspace undo previous --no-workspace
--interactive undo previous --non-interactive
--no-standard-rcfiles replaces --norc
--standard-rcfiles undo previous --no-standard-rcfiles
--no-builtin-rcfile replaces --nostd
--builtin-rcfile undo previous --no-builtin-rcfile
--clear-rcfiles undo previous --rcfile
--verbose [-v] increase verbosity (opposite of --quiet)
- Global options now hidden:
--roster-cache-performance-log
- New command options:
add
--no-recursive undo previous --recursive
--respect-ignore undo previous --no-respect-ignore
--no-unknown undo previous --unknown
bisect \*, checkout, pivot\_root, pluck, update, automate update
--no-move-conflicting-paths undo previous --move-conflicting-paths

automate show\_conflicts
--no-ignore-suspend-certs undo previous --ignore-suspend-certs
automate log
--clear-from undo previous --from
--merges undo previous --no-merges
--clear-to undo previous --to
- Command options now hidden:
(several commands) --no-prefix
serve --stdio --no-transport-auth
(all netsync/remote commands) --min-netsync-version --max-netsync-version
- Deprecated options:
--norc use --no-standard-rcfiles
--nostd use --no-builtin-rcfile
--reallyquiet use --quiet --quiet
--debug use --verbose
- To aid command line typing, partial option names are tried to
be expanded; if the expansion leads to multiple possibilities,
all matches and an accompanying short description of the
particular expansion are displayed.
Two types of expansions are available: simple prefix matching
and word abbreviation matching. Single-word options like '--update'
are easier to expand from prefixes, as they're unique after a few
characters, in this example '--up' already matches.
Multi-word options like for example '--ignore-suspend-certs' might
collide however with single-worded ones and are best expanded from
abbreviations, in this case '--isc'.
- The 'disapprove' command now accepts a revision range in
addition to a single revision.
- A new 'manpage' command has been added which dumps the monotone
command help including all global and command specific options in
standard troff format. If this command is used interactively, its
output is automatically processed through nroff and less, in case
both are available on your system. If not, you can change the default
command by overwriting the 'get\_man\_page\_formatter\_command' hook.
The 'manpage' command is also used to create a static version of
mtn(1) which is now installed with the rest of monotone's docs.
- New 'k:' selector type to query revisions where at least one
certificate was signed with the given key.
- New automate command 'log' which behaves identical to the
normal 'log' command, except that it only outputs the
revision ids.
- New automate command 'checkout' which works just as its
non-automate counterpart.
- Monotone now tracks file size information (hence the previously
mentioned schema change).
File sizes are currently only queryable via the automation
interface, directly for specific files via 'get\_file\_size' or
as part of the extended manifest (see below), but these
information may become visible as part of the user UI later on
as well.
- New automate command 'get\_extended\_manifest\_of', which prints
a beefed-up manifest format with file size and extensive marking
information. This can be used to easily determine when specific
nodes have been changed or moved at last.
- New automate commands 'put\_public\_key', 'get\_public\_key' and
'drop\_public\_key'. (closes monotone bug #30345)
Bugs fixed
- The 'mv' command now warns when a source is being renamed onto
itself or one of its children (fixes monotone bug #29484).
- The 'mv' command now also handles this usage properly, where
'foo' is a directory:
$ mv foo bar
$ mtn mv --bookkeep-only foo bar
- monotone no longer asks to pick a branch from a set of branches
of a revision in which all but one branch have been suspended
(fixes monotone bug #29843)
- The annotate command no longer fails if it should print out
empty or untrusted date cert values
(fixes monotone bug #30150)
- monotone now tries harder to find the cancel hint in a commit
message and only aborts if it can't find it anywhere
(fixes monotone bug #30215)
- The import command no longer warns about not being able
to write out \_MTN/options on --dry-run
(fixes monotone bug #30225)
- 'automate remote' and 'automate remote\_stdio' can now be used
without transport authentication (e.g. on file:// or ssh://
transports) as well as anonymously over netsync
(fixes monotone bug #30237)
- monotone does no longer warn about missing implicit includes
when dealing with restricted file sets
(fixes monotone bug #30291)
- The 'passphrase' and 'dropkey' commands now handle private keys
in old-style key files (without the hash part in the file name)
properly.
monotone also makes it very sure now that the key file of a
private key which is about to be deleted really and only
contains the key which should be deleted and nothing else
(fixes monotone bug #30376)
- monotone no longer throws an unrecoverable error if a public or
private key is addressed with some non-existing key id
(fixes monotone bug #30462)
- A globish that contains a bracket pair with an empty sub-pattern
such as "{,.foo}", "{.foo,}" or even "{.foo,,.bar}" now correctly
expands the empty target, so e.g. the branch pattern
"net.venge.monotone{,.\*}"
now matches "net.venge.monotone" and "net.venge.monotone.\*"
as expected. (fixes monotone bug #30655)
- A regression in 0.48 made a path-restricted 'mtn log' show
revisions, in which not the picked path(s), but one of its parents
were changed. This has been fixed.
- 'mtn trusted' will no longer accept single bogus revision ids,
but instead validates if the given revision really exists in the
current database.
- 'mtn read' (and also 'mtn automate read\_packets') now tests public
and private key data more thoroughly and aborts if it encounters
invalid data.
- 'mtn conflicts store' now gives a proper error message when
run outside a workspace (fixes monotone bug #30473)
- monotone did not properly parse URIs which missed a scheme or
which did not mark the start of the authority with a double slash.
This has been fixed.
(fixes monotone issue 94)
Thu Oct 21 23:45:45 UTC 2010
0.48.1 bugfix release.
Security related changes:
- Running "mtn ''" or "mtn ls ''" doesn't cause an internal
error anymore. In monotone 0.48 and earlier this behavior
could be used to crash a server remotely (but only if it was
configured to allow execution of remote commands).
Therefore everyone running such a server should update as
soon as possible.
Other changes:
- The --no-format-dates option is now set per default on Win32
for the commit command, because there's no date parsing
method in the Win32 API. In the changelog editor dates are
thus showed and (expected to be entered) in monotone's
internal datetime format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS).
- Using mtn:// style URIs for netsync operations didn't work
with 0.48 on systems which only have a 'monotone' entry in
/etc/services. Failing to find a corresponding entry for the
schema in a given URI isn't considered fatal now, instead
mtn falls back to its default port.
- Compilation issues on Win32 have been fixed.
Sun Jun 13 22:13:53 UTC 2010
0.48 release.
Changes
- Much more information is now passed to the editor when composing a
commit message for a new revision. The Author, Date, Branch and
Changelog values may now all be changed directly in the editor
allowing new branches to be created without using the --branch option.
Changes to other lines of this information must not be made or the
commit will abort.
- The edit\_comment lua hook now only takes one argument which is the
text to be passed to the editor to edit a commit. Existing hooks that
override the default hook will need to be changed to work properly.
- The long date/time format used by 'status', 'commit' and 'log' must
be sufficient to preserve a date through a formatting and parsing
cycle. The 'status' command now checks for this and warns if the
format is unsuitable and 'commit' will refuse to operate with an
unsuitable format.
- The output of the 'status' and 'log' commands has changed to align
with the new information displayed by 'commit' so that all three
commands display revisions similarly.
- The 'setup' as well as the 'clone' command check if no managed default
database exists and if no database is given either as command line
or as workspace option and eventually create a new default database
outside of the bookkeeping directory of the new workspace (see below
for more information on the new management features).
- The output of monotone diff has changed to use /dev/null as the source
for added files and as the target for deleted files. This is
compatible with patch(1) and will cause it to add and delete files
where appropriate. As part of this change diff will now include the
removed contents of deleted files which were omitted in earlier
versions of monotone.
- Monotone will only warn about bad certs if there are not also matching
trusted certs. So if someone commits a bad branch cert, monotone will
only warn about that bad cert until someone else approves that
revision into the same branch (fixes monotone bug #8033).
- 'db check' now checks for errors in the branch heads cache,
and 'db regenerate\_caches' fixes them.
- The output of the Lua functions print() and io.write() is now
redirected to the standard progress message stream of monotone.
See chapter 6.3 in the documentation for details.
New features
- Monotone has now database management capabilities: If you place your
databases in one or more specific locations (defaults to
%APPDIR%/monotone/databases on Windows and $HOME/.monotone/databases
on Linux, configurable by a hook), it is able to discover these
databases and access them only by giving the (base) name of their
filename, for example ":my-database.mtn".
You can also directly create new databases in the first found default
location by issuing 'mtn db init -d ":my-database.mtn".
Some commands, like 'setup' and 'clone' automatically fall back to
a default database (":default.mtn", also configurable by a hook) if
no database option is explicitely given.
Additionally, monotone remembers checked out workspaces for every
managed database and displays these "known" registered paths together
with other information in the new 'list databases' command
(closes monotone bug #8916).
- A set of accompanying management commands - 'register\_workspace',
'unregister\_workspace' and 'cleanup\_workspace\_list' - to handle moved
or removed workspaces for managed databases have been added.
- Many commands that change the heads of a branch (approve, disapprove,
pull, merge, etc) can now take an option "--update". If run from
a workspace which is based on a head of the branch and has no local
changes, this option makes these commands update that workspace to
the new head. If you always want this behavior, you can define the
get\_default\_command\_options(cmd)
hook in your monotonerc (fixes monotone bug #17878).
- New command 'undrop' which undoes a 'drop' done by mistake
(fixes monotone bug #13604).
- New automation command 'update' which behaves identical to
the normal 'update' command.
- 'ls tags' now outputs the branch name(s) a tagged revision is on.
The revision id is shortened to the first ten characters to get some
more space for this (fixes monotone bug #12773).
- Default include and exclude patterns are now remembered per server.
This means that you can have for example one server that you sync
everything to, and one that you only sync some branches to, and you
don't have to worry about forgetting to give the include pattern and
accidentally trying to sync everything to the second server.
- A new Lua extension function change\_workspace(directory) has been
added. This should be most useful for custom commands which need
to work on multiple workspaces from the same monotone instance.
- There is also the new server\_set\_listening(bool) Lua extention
function available since 0.47, which can be used to let a monotone
server exit gracefully instead of having to be killed.
Bugs fixed
- A regression in 0.47 prevent successful execution of push / pull /
sync over pipes (Debian bug 574512); this has been fixed.
- A bug in 0.46 and 0.47 could lead to pulls or possibly commits taking
approximately forever, if any of the previous branch heads was not a
"close" relation of the new head. This has been fixed.
- Several bugs related to restrictions not including the required parent
directories of included files have been fixed. It is now possible to
say 'mtn add a/b/c' followed by 'mtn commit a/b/c' and have the commit
succeed. See the restrictions section in the manual for more details
(fixes monotone bugs #15994, #17499, #20447 and #22044).
- monotone no longer saves changed options from the command line back
to \_MTN/options in case the command execution was unsuccessful
(fixes monotone bug #22928).
- When monotone reads packets from files, like f.e. keys in a directory
given by the --keydir option, and these files are large and do
not contain packet data at all, monotone no longer uses an excessive
amount of time and memory to figure this out
(fixes monotone bug #28799).
- The 'log' command no longer crashes if it is executed in a workspace
whose parent revision(s) do not exist in the specified database
(fixes monotone bug #29677).
- The 'clone' command no longer removes an existing bookkeeping
directory if the target directory "." points to a workspace
(fixes monotone bug #29927).
- The commands in monotone's help output are now sorted alphabetically.
- monotone on Windows will now have a non-zero exit code when
interrupted (^C). This was broken in 0.47 when it was fixed to not
throw an exception on being interrupted.
- In 0.46 and 0.47, monotone could sometimes get confused
about which revisions were the heads of a particular branch.
This would happen when a new branch cert was added to a
revision that was an ancestor of one or more of the current
heads of the branch, most commonly during netsync when
multiple people had performed identical merges. This is
fixed now. 'db check' will identify the problem; if your
database currently gives incorrect 'heads' results, or 'mtn
bug' on 'merge', you can fix it by running 'mtn db
regenerate\_caches'.
- In 0.46, spurious network disconnects could occur when transferring
sufficiently large items (files, diffs, revisions). This was fixed
in 0.47 but not noted in the release notes at that time
(fixes monotone bug #28991).
- monotone on Windows will now have a non-zero exit code when
interrupted (^C). This was broken in 0.47 when it was fixed to not
throw an exception on being interrupted.
- the 'mv' command now warns when a source is being renamed onto
itself (fixes monotone bug #29484).
Other
- Support for the diffuse merger (http://diffuse.sourceforge.net)
has been added.
Sun Mar 14 21:15:06 UTC 2010
0.47 release.
Changes
- The default '' author used by the git\_export command has
changed to 'Unknown ' and must be changed in existing author
map files. The old '' author will be rejected by the new
validate\_git\_author lua hook.
- The 'git\_export' command now validates all git author and committer
values using a new 'validate\_git\_author' lua hook before they are
written to the output stream. The export will fail if any value is
rejected by this hook.
- The 'git\_export' command now calls a new 'unmapped\_git\_author' lua
hook for all git author values not found in the author map file. The
default implementation of this hook attempts to produce valid git
authors using several default pattern replacements.
- The 'get\_date\_format\_spec' lua hook now has an additional parameter
which hints at the wanted format (f.e. a short date or a long date
time). The default implementation now returns '%x' for short and
long dates, '%X' for short and long times (currently unused) and
'%x %X' for short and long date times.
- The options '--date-format' and '--no-format-dates' are no longer
specific to the 'log' command, but can now be used globally.
- monotone now prompts only three times for a key password.
New features
- Added portuguese translation (thanks to AmÃƒÂ©rico Monteiro)
Bugs fixed
- 'passphrase' now allows an empty new password to be given
(fixes monotone bug #28809)
- 'automate remote' and 'automate remote\_stdio' no longer
require an existing database (fixes monotone bug #28885)
- monotone no longer throws an exception on Windows if it is
interrupted (^C); a couple of other bug have been fixed for this
platform as well which generally improve the compatibility.
- The annotation of 'annotate' is now localized.
- The various occurrences where a revision is described by its
certs now come with proper localized date output.
- Fix problems with newer Lua versions especially when
LUA\_COMPAT\_VARARG not set.
Other
- Roster handling has been sped up significantly, and roster cache
performance has been fixed for the case of overly large rosters.
This should be mostly noticable when digging through history
(especially initial pulls, since those send so many revisions),
and be more noticable for projects with larger trees.
The most significant internal change from this is that rosters and
marking\_maps are now copy-on-write. A longer overview of the internal
changes is at:
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/monotone-devel/2010-02/msg00043.html
- Improve the compatibility with newer Botan versions.
Sun Jan 17 21:40:35 UTC 2010
0.46 release.
Changes
- "automate stdio" (and "automate remote\_stdio", see below)
use separate streams to encode out-of-band information like
informational messages, warnings or tickers. A special
"header" section has been added to the standard output to
identify future stdio version changes. The error codes used
in the output of both stdio and remote\_stdio, have also
slightly changed: errors which are the result of a wrong
call (unknown command, invalid options, parsing errors, ...)
are returned with code 1, while errors which happened while
the actual command executed are returned with code 2. Error
codes are no longer echoed with every packet, but only as
the payload of the final 'l' ("last") packet.
Please consult the manual section "mtn automate stdio" for a
detailed description of the new format.
- The 'heads' command should be significantly faster now (not
that it was particularly slow before). This probably isn't
terribly noticable unless you're in the habit of using "h:\*"
(heads of all branches) as a selector, it's primarily meant
to enable future changes that will depend on fast 'heads'.
The database schema has been changed, so you will need to
run 'mtn db migrate' (preferably after making a backup copy
of your db).
- the 'status' command now includes the current (to be committed)
revision number and will indicate when the branch option in
\_MTN/options has been changed and does not match one of the
revision's parent branches.
- Cert labels in the output of the 'log' command are now
localized.
New features
- There's a new command "automate remote\_stdio" that makes it
possible to execute automate commands on a remote server
(for example, to permit a single database to be used both
for serving netsync connections and for running a viewmtn
instance). This requires that the server be running monotone
0.46 or later. Access control on the server uses a new lua
hook "get\_remote\_automate\_permitted(identity, command\_line,
options)".
- There's also a new command "automate remote" that's very much
the same, but executes only a single command and does not
stdio-encode the output.
- A new 'bisect' command has been added to allow searching for a
specific revision within a range of revisions. This can be useful for
locating the exact revision that broke something or removed a
particular feature.
- Three new commands - 'push', 'pull' and 'sync' - have been added
to the automation interface. They work just as their non-automate
counterparts.
- The global option '--timestamps' has been added which prefixes
the current local timestamp before diagnostic messages such as
warnings, progress messages, errors and tickers. For example,
this option can be used to log the date and time when clients
connect to a monotone server.
Bugs fixed
- A regression from 0.45's key migration prevented the proper
output of the `committer` field in 'git\_export'.
- 'db info --full' no longer crashes when executed on a database
with only one revision.
- The mtn\_automate Lua function which can be used for custom
commands now properly handles binary data.
- `db info` now returns a correct byte count for certs again.
- If a public key was read in via the `read` or
`automate read\_packets`, an invariant was triggered if the
key was already existing in the database. This has been fixed.
- `annotate` no longer crashes if the annotated file is empty.
Other
- Added the script of the Lua-based contributed Monotone
extension command "mtn remote\_export" to contrib/command/
with which a remote revision can be exported locally without
having to fetch all of the history before.
Fri Sep 11 20:50:00 UTC 2009
0.45 release.
Changes
- Certs now link to the key that signed them by the key's
hash, instead of its name. This should provide some
security and usability improvements.
The database schema has been changed, so you will need to
run 'mtn db migrate' (preferably after making a backup copy
of your db).
The netsync protocol version has also changed. However, we
found space to implement full protocol version negotiation,
so no flag day is needed. If your particular project has a
situation where there are multiple keys with the same name,
you will receive errors when trying to sync certs signed by
those keys to older netsync peers.
A number of commands have slightly different output now,
particularly 'ls certs', 'ls tags', 'automate keys',
'automate tags' and 'automate certs'. There is a new Lua
hook associated with these changes,
'get\_local\_key\_name(identity)', and all Lua hooks that used
to take a key name as an argument now instead take a table
with several fields.
Commands which previously accepted a key name now also
accept the key's hash or local name, which is a local alias
for equally named keys. 'read-permissions' and
'write-permissions' accept either the key name or the hash.
There is also a new 'db fix\_certs' command which fixes wrong
key assignments in migrated databases if you have the correct
key available.
- The 'resolved\_user' conflict resolution is no longer
reported by 'automate show\_conflicts' for file content
conflicts; 'resolved\_user\_left' is used instead.
- 'format\_version' was removed from 'automate tags' and
'automate get\_attributes' which both do not need this
additional versioning information.
New features
- The 'log' command now, by default, converts all dates it
prints to your timezone instead of leaving them in UTC, and
uses a somewhat more friendly format for the dates.
You can customize the date format with the new
"get\_date\_format\_spec" Lua hook, which returns a strftime(3)
format string. You can also override the format for one
command with the new --date-format option, disable date
conversion for one command with --no-format-dates, or
disable it by default by having the above Lua hook return an
empty string.
- The 'diff' and 'automate content\_diff' commands take a
'--reverse' option when one revision is specified, to
control the order of the diff with the workspace.
- The 'update', 'checkout', 'pluck', and 'pivot\_root' commands
take an option '--move-conflicting-paths', to handle
unversioned files that are blocking the action. The
unversioned files are moved to
\_MTN/resolutions/, so the action can
succeed, and the user can recover the files if necessary.
- Resolution of orphaned file conflicts is now supported by
'merge --resolve-conflicts' and the 'conflicts' commands.
- Duplicate name conflicts now support the 'keep' resolution.
- Monotone now accepts ':memory:' as argument to the --db option
and sets up a memory-only SQLite database.
- 'clone' allows cloning into the current directory when
'.' is given as argument.
Bugs fixed
- Monotone now sanely skips paths with invalid characters
it encounters during 'add' or 'automate inventory'.
- Key names, cert names, and var domains with non-ASCII
characters should work properly now. Previously, they would
be (usually) converted to punycode on input, and not decoded
on output. They will now not be converted to punycode at
all.
- The 'conflict' commands can now handle duplicate name
conflicts for directories.
- 'cvs\_import' now properly parses CVS timestamps (again).
- Windows' cmd.exe is recognized as smart terminal and thus
monotone should create more readable output in
netsync operations.
Tue May 12 20:44:00 UTC 2009
0.44 release.
Changes
- Private keys no longer have a separate hash from the associated
public key. This changes the hashes output by 'ls keys', and also
changes the format of 'automate keys' and 'automate genkey'.
New features
- New 'w:' selector type for selecting the revision the workspace
is based on.
Bugs fixed
- C++ exceptions in Lua extension functions are now converted into
Lua errors catchable with pcall, instead of causing a crash.
- In 0.43 revert became excessively noisy and would report changes to
all attributes on included files and directories regardless of whether
the attributes had been changed or not. This has been silenced.
Monotone will now specifically report changes to execute permissions
only when they occur.
- In 0.43 monotone would lose execute permissions on all files modified
during an update operation. Execute permissions are now reset on
updated files that have the mtn:execute attribute set to true.
- Invalid revision selectors now cause an immediate error instead of
being dropped from the selection. The old behavior could produce
undesired effects from typoed commands, such as spewing a list of
all revisions in the database.
- If "automate stdio" is in use, invalid selectors are reported via
the automate protocol rather than on stderr.
- "Best-effort" character set conversions now work again; 'mtn log'
will not crash just because there is a change log entry with a
character not representable in your locale. However, if your system
iconv(3) implementation does not support the //TRANSLIT extension,
you may see garbage characters in the above scenario.
Internal
- Various small code changes to make monotone compile under (Open)
Solaris using Sun Studio, and under Windows with Visual C++.
- monotone.spec has been removed from the distribution.
Sun Mar 22 22:26:00 UTC 2009
0.43 release.
Changes
- The Monotone source distribution no longer includes copies of
several third-party libraries. This means they must be downloaded
and built separately, before building monotone. See INSTALL for a
complete list of necessary libraries.
This allows monotone's developers to concentrate on monotone
itself, rather than tracking external library updates, which in
practice did not happen. By way of illustration, we were still
shipping sqlite 3.4.1, which is years out of date. This has also
been a long-standing request of various redistributors of binary
packages, who prefer the use of globally shared libraries.
- There is a new db var "database delta-direction", which can have
values "reverse" (default), "forward", and "both". This controls
what kind of deltas are stored for new file versions. Forward
deltas are very fast for netsync, but slow for most other uses.
Set this to "both" (or perhaps "forward" if you're very short on
disk space) on an empty db and pull everything into it, to get a
database which will be much faster for server usage (especially
initial pulls).
- 'mtn help ' or 'mtn  --help' no
longer print global options, thus making the output of specific help
requests more compact. You still see all available global options
by executing 'mtn help' without any arguments.
- 'mtn automate get\_current\_revision' now returns an empty changeset
instead of an error if a workspace contains no changes.
New features
- A monotone database may be exported in the git fast-import format
using the git\_export command. The output from this command may be
piped into git fast-import or other tools supporting this format.
- Additional 'u:' and 'm:' selector types for selecting the revision the
workspace was last updated from and revisions matching specified
message globs in changelog and comment certs.
- Additional '--revision' option for 'mtn log' allows logging of
selected sets of revisions.
- Additional '--full' option for 'mtn db info' to display some
statistic analysis of the date certs in the database.
- Command line options in the EDITOR and/or VISUAL environment
variables are honored; for instance, EDITOR="emacs -nw"
works now. (Debian bug #320565.)
- The `mtn\_automate' lua function now correctly parses and sets
options for executed automate commands.
- The 'commit' command accepts a non-empty \_MTN/log as the log
message when '--message-file=\_MTN/log' is given.
Bugs fixed
- Performance of the log command has been improved significantly.
Previous versions of monotone loaded individual certs by name for each
printed revision and this caused sqlite to not use the correct
index. Now, all certs are loaded for each printed revision once and
individual certs are selected from the full list which allows sqlite
to use the preferred index.
- In 0.42, a netsync writer would attempt to queue up all outgoing
data as soon as it knew what data to send, in a single operation,
without servicing the event loop. If there was a large amount of
data to send, this would cause very long pauses and sometimes
timeouts and dropped connections (for pauses over 10 minutes).
The bug that caused this is fixed, and that operation now has a
safety timer that should prevent it from coming back.
- When the netsync server receives garbage over the network, it
should be much better about only terminating the offending connection
instead of the entire server.
- The log command was missing '--depth' and '--exclude' options used to
restrict revisions printed to those touching specific paths. Log now
allows these options and uses them properly.
- The update command previously did not clear execute permissions from
files that had their associated 'mtn:execute' attribute cleared.
- Several minor problems with workspace attributes have been fixed.
Earlier versions of monotone would reset attributes such as
mtn:execute on all files when any workspace modifying command was
executed. Applying attribute changes to workspace files is now done
much more selectively in the same manner that content and name changes
are applied.
- In certain cases, especially also on FreeBSD and Mac OS X, netsync
called select() even after read() returned 0 bytes to indicate the
end of the file, resulting in a confusing error message. This
is fixed by treating EOF specially and prevent further calls
to select() on the file handle, as recommended by the
select\_tut man page.
- If given a filename, `mtn ssh\_agent\_export' now creates that
file with the correct permissions (i.e. mode 600), creates
directories as necessary, and does not throw an internal
error if creation or writing fails. (You're still on your
own for directory creation and permissions if you take the
key on standard output and redirect it to a file.)
- The `p:' selector now accepts single character revision ids.
- `mtn merge\_into\_workspace' no longer crashes if one tries to merge
in an ancestor or descendant of a workspace, but gives a helpful
error message.
- Several bugfixes to `mtn automate stdio':
\* It now correctly distinguishs between syntax and command errors by
returning error code 1 for the former and error code 2 for the
latter - just as advertised in the documentation.
\* The stdio event loop no longer quits if a syntax error occurs, but
rather discards the wrong state and accepts new (valid) commands.
\* Option errors haven't been catched properly and thus weren't encoded
in stdio either; this has been fixed as well.
\* Global options, which were set or changed by a previously executed
command, weren't properly reset before the next command was issued.
It was f.e. not possible to "unignore" suspended branches for
the `branches' command when `--ignore-suspend-certs' was given in
a previous run. Now only those global options persist between
executed commands which were given to stdio directly.
Internal
- Using 64 bit integer values to represent dates internally. This
has no user visible effect.
- The unit test code has been separated from the main source, thus
building the tests no longer requires a full recompilation. Also,
the number of modules which are linked into unit tester has
decreased tremendously.
- A couple of debug commands have been added to the `database'
command group to aid performance timing. See `mtn help --hidden db'
for a list of available commands.
- Our internal error handling has been overhauled. N() is gone, and E()
takes three arguments instead of 2: E(bool, origin::type, i18n\_format).
origin::type is an enum describing the source of the error, eg network,
user, internal. Data types can publically inherit origin\_aware (as the
vocab types do) to obtain a public origin::type member named
'made\_from'; this can then be supplied to E() when sanity-checking
that data. origin\_aware and origin::type are in origin\_type.hh.
I() will throw a unrecoverable\_failure, and E() will throw either a
unrecoverable\_failure or a recoverable\_failure depending on the
origin::type provided. informative\_failure is gone.
Fri Dec 26 22:08:00 UTC 2008
0.42 release.
Changes
- The output of 'automate show\_conflicts' has been changed; a
default resolution for file content conflicts and user resolutions
for other conflict types has been added. 'directory\_loop\_created'
changed to 'directory\_loop'.
- The French, Brazilian-Portuguese and Japanese translations were
outdated and thus have been removed from the distribution. In case
you care about them and want them back, drop us a note at
monotone-devel@nongnu.org.
Bugs fixed
- 'mtn db kill\_rev\_locally' did not update the inodeprint
cache when executed from a workspace on which the
revision's changes where applied.
- Some recent performance issues have been corrected:
\* since 0.40, there is much more use of hex encoding/decoding.
These functions have been sped up considerably.
\* since 0.40, every command in an 'automate stdio' session
would reinitialize the database. This was rather slow, so
monotone will now keep the database open between commands.
- The Lua-based contributed Monotone extension introduced in
0.38 haven't been added to the tarball; this has been fixed.
- Monotone died if \_MTN/options contained an empty / not-existing
'keydir' entry. This has been fixed. Also, invalid options are now
better detected and give a more useful error message.
- Monotone crashed if it was called with more than 2048 command
line arguments. This has been fixed.
- If vim is used as merger, it no longer prompts the user for an
enter key press.
- Decoding errors f.e. through to garbage from the network no longer
results in informative failures, but in warning. This was made
possible by introducing the concept of origin-aware sanity checks.
- Monotone crashed if it was called with nested wildcards such as
'a.{i.{x,y},j}'. This has been fixed.
- The standard implementation of the 'ignore\_file' hook now accepts
windows and unix line endings in .mtn-ignore files.
New features
- New 'mtn ls duplicates' command which lets you list
duplicated files in a given revision or the workspace.
- New option --no-workspace, to make monotone ignore any
workspace it might have been run in.
- New command group 'mtn conflicts \*'; provides asynchronous
conflict resolutions for merge and propagate.
- New 'automate file\_merge' command which runs the internal line
merger on two files from two revisions and outputs the result.
- New 'automate lua' command with which lua functions, like
monotone hooks, can be called over automate. This is particularily
useful to get user defaults, like ignorable files, branch keys and
passwords, which are managed through one or more monotonerc files.
- New 'automate read\_packets' command which reads data packets like
public keys similar to 'mtn read'.
- 'merge' and 'propagate' accept user commit messages; the
'merge rev rev' or 'propagate branch branch' message will be
prefixed to the user message. --no-prefix removes the prefix.
Internal
- Update Botan to 1.7.12.
Wed Sep 3 21:13:18 UTC 2008
0.41 release.
Changes
- 'mtn clone' now takes a branch argument rather than a branch
option which is more what people expect given the fact that
mtn push/pull/sync do not use a branch option either.
- 'mtn automate inventory' will show the birth revision for
any file that has been committed.
Bugs fixed
- If the options '--db' or '--keydir' were previously
specified for a command which was executed inside a
workspace and one or both option arguments were invalid
(f.e. invalid paths), they were still written to
\_MTN/options of the particular workspace. This lead to
errors on any subsequent command which used these
options. This bug is fixed in so far that basic file type
checks are applied on both options, so its no longer
possible to set non-existing paths accidentally or use a
path to a directory as option argument for '--db'.
- If a key clash occurs on a netsync operation, i.e. two
different keys with the same key id are encountered, mtn now
fails cleanly and provides further guidance how to proceed.
- It was previously not possible to clone a branch / database
anonymously; this has been fixed.
- If the client tries to use an unknown key, try to fall back
to anonymous pull instead of failing immediately.
- 'mtn automate identify' was broken in 0.40 when used over
stdio, i.e. the output of the command did not get into the
right output channel; this has been fixed.
- Monotone would produce a warning if executed from the root
directory of a Windows drive; this has been fixed.
- The 'note\_commit' hook now returns the new revision id
hex-encoded again - the bug was introduced in 0.40.
New features
- New 'mtn suspend' command which lets you mark certain
revisions and thus whole branches as discontinued
("suspended") by attaching a special suspend cert to the
revision. All relevant mtn commands (f.e. mtn heads,
mtn ls branches) honor this cert by default. To ignore it,
simply add '--ignore-suspend-certs' to your command line.
Suspended revisions can have children, which are in no
way affected by the cert of their parent, i.e. suspended
development lines or branches can simply be "unsuspended"
by committing to them.
This feature was already added in monotone 0.37, but was
forgotten to be mentioned in NEWS back then.
- New 'get\_default\_command\_options' lua hook which lets you
specify default options for a given, triggered command.
Useful f.e. if you always want to have your 'mtn add'
command executed with '-R' / '--recursive'.
- Add 'automate show\_conflicts' command.
- Add 'automate get\_workspace\_root' command.
- Add Lua hooks 'note\_netsync\_revision\_sent',
'note\_netsync\_cert\_sent' and 'note\_netsync\_pubkey\_sent'.
Fri Apr 11 22:50:44 UTC 2008
0.40 release.
Changes
- The vim merger has been improved and now uses diff3 to merge
non-conflict changes automatically before executing vimdiff.
- Values used with the --depth option used to control recursion with
node and path restrictions have changed. Using --depth=0 now means
exactly the specified directories and \*not\* their children. Using
--depth=1 now means the specified directories and their immediate
children. Previously --depth=0 included children and --depth=1
included grandchildren and it was not possible to exclude children
using --depth. The simple fix for anyone using --depth is to add 1 to
the values they are using.
- Document that ssh: and file: sync transports are not supported on
native Win32.
Bugs fixed
- `commit' now uses keydir specified in \_MTN/options
- duplicate name conflicts now show a proper error message, even if
a parent directory got renamed as well. In that case, the error
message now shows both names for the directory and the offending
file name.
New features
- The bare parent selector 'p:' can now be used in a workspace to
query the parent(s) of the workspace' base revision. This is
equivalent to "mtn au select p:`mtn au get\_base\_workspace\_revision`".
- push, pull, and sync can be run with a single argument, which looks
like
mtn://hostname?include\_pattern/-exclude\_pattern
or
mtn://hostname?include=include\_pattern/exclude=exclude\_pattern
Internal
- Update Botan to 1.7.4.
- Usage of the internal app\_state object has been reduced, objects
are better encapsulated now. The database interface has been
enhanced to ease reduction of locking contention in the future.
- Merged the two indexes on revision\_certs into a single one.
- The database schema has been changed so that it now stores
binary SHA1 hashes rather than their hexadecimal encoding,
in most places where these are used. This reduces the
database size and speeds up operations a little.
Users who like to fiddle with the database directly are
advised to use the sqlite functions hex() and quote() to
print columns that store hashes (including IDs), and the
hexadecimal literal notation x'DEADBEEF' to input them.
- Binary SHA1 hashes are also used for most in-memory
processing, avoiding conversions and saving memory.
Mon Feb 25 15:55:36 UTC 2008
0.39 release.
Changes
- 'mtn di' is now an alias for 'mtn diff'.
- 'automate db\_set' has been renamed to 'automate set\_db\_variable'.
- 'automate db\_get' has been replaced by 'automate get\_db\_variables'
which returns all database variables similar to 'list vars' in
basic\_io format, optionally restricted by domain.
- The REVID argument of 'automate get\_revision' is now mandatory;
to retrieve the current workspace revision, use the new command
'automate get\_current\_revision'
- messages describing conflicts from all of the various merge commands
have been reworked and should be much more informative.
- mtn show\_conflicts now outputs much more detailed and descriptive
messages, however it may report content conflicts that will be
resolved automatically by the line merger.
- The internal copy of PCRE has been updated to version 7.6.
If you use the '--with-system-pcre' configure switch, it
will insist on at least this version.
- "emacs" has been removed from the list of dumb terminal types;
tickers should now default to --ticker=count with emacs terminals
- extensive section on merge conflicts and ways to resolve them
added to the manual.
Bugs fixed
- for changes near the beginning of a file, mtn's unified diff
output sometimes contained too many leading context lines.
- the path handling of 'mtn revert' was improved and fixed two bugs:
now a restricted revert on a node "dir1/file1" reverts only the
content changes in "file1", but leaves renames of any of its
ancestor nodes untouched; furthermore, if "dir0/" was renamed to
"dir1" and "dir1/file1" was dropped, mtn now re-creates file1 at the
proper place ("dir1/") and leaves no missing files around because
of the non-existing "dir0/".
- a few changes needed to build with gcc 4.3.
New features
- 'automate drop\_db\_variables' which drops one database variable
(like the 'unset' command) or all variables within a given domain.
- 'automate inventory' now accepts the options '--no-ignored',
'--no-unknown', '--no-unchanged' and '--no-corresponding-renames'.
Please consult the monotone documentation for more information about
these new options.
In addition, 'automate inventory' no longer recurses into ignored
directories. The typical case of listing files that need attention
now runs at least four times faster.
- 'automate get\_current\_revision' which outputs the revision text of
changes in the current workspace
Wed Dec 12 21:21:15 UTC 2007
0.38 release.
Changes
- mtn log now prints a single dot for a project's root
directory instead of an empty string.
- mtn now warns if changes to a file will be ignored because
the file has been deleted on one side of a merge.
- mtn now errors if your chosen private key doesn't match the public
key of the same name in your database.
- mtn now checks for your key before a merge action takes place to
ensure that any manually merged file isn't lost in an error case
Bugs fixed
- a bug introduced in 0.37 prevented an external merger from being
executed unless the MTN\_MERGE environment variable was set
- mtn read successfully reads revision data, and cert packets again
- mtn consistently supports certs with empty values
(fixed 'ls certs' and 'read')
Internal
- Update Botan to 1.7.2.
- Moved the gzip implementation out of the Botan directory.
Other
- Added the scripts of the following Lua-based contributed
Monotone extension commands to contrib/command/:
"mtn base", "mtn fuse", "mtn revision", "mtn conflicts".
- Added a hooks version of the contributed ciabot script,
contrib/ciabot\_monotone\_hookversion.lua
- The monotone manual is now licensed under the GPL rather than
the GFDL.
Fri Oct 25 22:35:33 UTC 2007
0.37 release.
Changes
- mtn db kill\_rev\_locally now checks for an existing workspace
before the revision is killed and tries to apply the changes
of this particular revision back to the workspace to allow
easy re-committing afterwards
- the "--brief" switch for mtn annotate has been renamed to
"--revs-only" for clarity
- mtn help now lists the commands (and their aliases) available
within a group, so its easier to get an overview which commands
are available at all
- the "MTN\_MERGE=diffutils" merger (provided by std\_hooks.lua)
was improved. It now accepts a MTN\_MERGE\_DIFFUTILS environment
variable which can be used to control its behaviour
through comma-separated "key[=value]" entries. Currently
supported entries are "partial" for doing a partial
batch/non-modal 3-way merge conflict "resolution" which uses
embedded content conflict markers and "diff3opts=[...]" and
"sdiffopts=[...]" for passing arbitrary options to the used
"diff3" and "sdiff" tools. When used in combination with "mtn
merge\_into\_workspace" this way one especially can achieve a
CVS/SVN style non-modal workspace-based merging.
- There is a new revision selector: "p:REV" selects the
parent(s) of revision REV. For example, if a revision has
one parent,
mtn diff -r p:REV -r REV
will show the changes made in that revision.
- Monotone now uses the Perl-Compatible Regular Expression
(PCRE) library for all regular expressions, instead of the
boost::regex library. This means that external Boost
libraries are no longer required to build or use Monotone.
If building from source, you will still need the Boost headers
available somewhere. See INSTALL for details.
PCRE's syntax for regular expressions is a superset of
boost::regex's syntax; it is unlikely that any existing
.mtn-ignore files or other user uses of regexps will break.
The manual now contains detailed documentation of the regexp
syntax, borrowed from PCRE itself.
- the format of "mtn automate inventory" has changed to basic\_io.
This fixes a couple of corner cases where the old format
returned wrong information and introduces new capabilities like
restricted output, recognized attribute changes, and more.
For a complete overview on the new format, please take a look
in the appropriate manual section.
Bugs fixed
- mtn automate heads called without a branch argument now properly
returns the head revisions of the workspace's branch if called
over mtn automate stdio
- mtn commit no longer crashes if it creates a revision whose
roster already exists, i.e. was left behind by the command
`mtn db kill\_rev\_locally REV` (savannah #18990)
Documentation changes
- the documentation of the "--revs-only" (formerly "--brief")
switch for the annotate command didn't match its actual
behavior, this has been fixed
- documentation for the "ssh\_agent\_add" command was missing
and has been added
Other
- contrib/usher.cc has been removed. Please use the
net.venge.monotone.contrib.usher branch instead.
Internal
- Update SQLite to 3.4.1.
- Update Lua to 5.1.2 plus latest bug fixes.
- Update Botan to 1.5.10.
- Internal use of regular expressions has been almost eliminated.
(Regular expressions are still used for .mtn-ignore and the
--show-encloser feature of mtn diff, and are still available to
Lua hooks.)
Fri Aug 3 06:08:36 UTC 2007
0.36 release.
Changes
- The help command is now able to show documentation on subcommands
(such as 'attr set').
- The help command now shows a brief abstract of each command,
instead of only listing their names.
- The command `list changed` now outputs the new path of any
renamed item making it easier to copy and paste these paths
for external program usage.
- `automate attributes` has been renamed to `automate get\_attributes`,
also a bug has been fixed there so resurrected attributes are now
properly outputted as "new" and not "changed".
New features
- Two new commands to set and drop attributes over automate:
`automate set\_attribute` and `automate drop\_attribute`
- There is a new function available to the lua hooks,
'server\_request\_sync(what, address, include, exclude)', which will
initate a netsync connection to the server at "address", with the
given include and exclude patterns, and will sync, push, or pull,
as given in the "what" argument. If called from a monotone instance
which is not acting as a server, this function will do nothing.
- There is a new hook available,
'get\_netsync\_key(server, include, exclude)', which is called to
determine which key to use for netsync operations. Note that the
server calls this once at startup with the address it is listening
on, "\*", and "" as arguments, rather than for each connection.
Other
- Giving the --confdir argument will automatically set the key store
directory to keys/ under that directory, unless --keydir is also
given. This is a bugfix.
- Fixed a regression in 0.35 that resulted in some databases
becoming significantly larger when storing new revisions. Existing
databases with this problem can be fixed by pulling into a fresh
database using 0.36.
- contrib/lua-mode.el, a Lua mode for GNU emacs.
- contrib/monotone-buildbot-notification.lua, a netsync hook to have a
server notify a buildbot when new changes have arrived. Useful for
anyone who uses a buildbot with monotone as source.
- contrib/monotone-cluster-push.lua, a netsync hook script to have
arriving changes be forwarded to other servers automatically. It
uses the new internal lua function 'server\_request\_sync'.
- contrib/mtn\_makepermissions, a simple script to create
read-permissions and write-permissions from files in the directories
read-permissions.d and write-permissions.d, Debian style.
- contrib/Monotone.pm, a first attempt to write a Perl module to
interface with 'monotone automate stdio'.
- contrib/monotone-import.pl has been removed since monotone now has
an internal import command.
Internal
- Commands are now defined as a tree of commands instead of a
plain list, which allows the help system to look up information
of a command at an level in the tree.
- The command class, the automate class and all the associated
macros have been cleaned up.
- All C++ files now depend on base.hh, which includes the few things
that are used virtually everywhere. 'make distcheck' will check for
the presence of base.hh in all source files and will protest if
it's not there. This is explained further in HACKING.
- Update the internal SQLite to version 3.4.0.
- Updated Visual C building system, which now also builds the test
programs. The script visualc/runtests.bat can be used to run the
tests.
- Monotone can now be built successfully with Boost 1.34. Older
versions of monotone would sometimes seem to work depending on
the compiler used, but would have bugs in path normalization.
- Monotone now requires Boost 1.33 or later.
- The Boost filesystem library is no longer required.
- The Boost unit test system is no longer required.
Mon May 7 14:08:44 UTC 2007
0.35 release.
Changes
- 'mkdir --no-respect-ignore PATH' now really skips any
ignore directives from .mtn-ignore or Lua hooks
- Private keys are now stored more safely, using file
permissions.
- The editable log summary (what you get in an editor when
committing without -m) now includes information about which
branch the commit applies to.
- The status command and the editable log summary now show
the same details about the change.
New features
- 'automate identify', an automate version of 'mtn identify'.
- 'automate roots', prints the roots of the revision graph,
i.e. all revisions that have no parents.
Other
- You can't drop the workspace root any more.
Internal
- Update the internal Lua to version 5.1.2.
- Added build files for Mac OS X.
- Update the internal SQLite to version 3.3.17.
- Code cleanup of app\_state.
Sun Apr 1 08:23:34 UTC 2007
0.34 release.
The internal data format has changed with this release;
migration is straight-forward. To upgrade your databases,
you must run:
$ mtn -d mydb.mtn db migrate
All of these operations are completely lossless, and 0.34
remains compatible with earlier versions all the way back
to 0.26 with regards to netsync.
Changes
- Text is now output at best of the environment's possibilities,
transliterating them or substituting '?' as needed.
- The lua hook get\_author() now takes a second argument, a
key identity, in case someone wants to create an author based
on that and not only the branch name.
- The command 'chkeypass' became 'passphrase'.
- The commands 'drop', 'rename' and 'pivot\_root' default to
always perform the operation in the file system as well.
They do not accept '--execute' any more, but will instead
take '--bookkeep-only' in case the user only wants to affect
bookkeeping files.
New features
- New hook note\_mtn\_startup(), which is called when monotone is
started.
- New Lua support function spawn\_pipe(), which is used to run
a command and get back its standard input and standard output
file handles as well as the pid.
- Monotone will automatically add a monotone key in a resident
ssh-agent when it's first used, and will then use ssh-agent
for all subsequent signing. Thus, you will only need to give
the password once in one session.
- New command 'ssh\_agent\_export' to export a monotone key into
an SSH key.
- New command 'ssh\_agent\_add' to add a monotone key explicitly
to a resident ssh-agent.
- New command 'clone' that combines 'pull' and 'checkout'.
- 'automate put\_file' and 'automate put\_revision' stores a file
and a revision in the database.
- 'automate cert', an automate version of 'mtn cert'.
- 'automate db\_set', an automate version of 'mtn set'.
- 'automate db\_get', an automate version of 'mtn ls vars' with
a twist.
Other
- contrib/ciabot\_monotone\_hookversion.py now uses a real
basic\_io parser and thus should send more precise
information to the cia server. Furthermore, it has become
more careful with creating zombies.
- contrib/monotone-log-of-pulled-revs-hook.lua, a lua hook
to display information about incoming revisions.
- contrib/monotone-mirror-postaction-push.sh, a post action
script that should be executed by contrib/monotone-mirror.sh
to automatically push data on to other servers.
- contrib/monotone-mirror.lua, a lua hook that executes
contrib/monotone-mirror.sh after any netsync session is done.
- contrib/monotone-mirror.sh now takes keydir and keyid
configuration and has better protection against overlapping
duplicate runs.
- contrib/monotone.bash\_completion now handles signals.
- contrib/monotone.el now includes a commit button.
Internal
- Date and time display has now been reimplemented internally
to avoid Boost more. This means that we have lowered our
dependency from Boost 1.33.0 to 1.32.0.
- Lots of code cleanup.
- The heights cache got an index, making the processing faster.
- Update the internal SQLite to version 3.3.13.
- Algorithm to find uncommon ancestors has been rewritten, so
'pull' and 'regenerate\_caches' should be faster.
Wed Feb 28 22:02:43 UTC 2007
0.33 release.
The internal data format has changed with this release;
migration is straight-forward. To upgrade your databases,
you must run:
$ mtn -d mydb.mtn db migrate
All of these operations are completely lossless, and 0.33
remains compatible with earlier versions with regards to
netsync.
Changes
- "mtn ls unknown" no longer recurses into unknown directories.
- update will fail rather than clobbering unversioned files
that exist in the workspace.
- update will detect directories with unversioned files before
attempting to drop them and will refuse to run rather than
corrupting the workspace. such unversioned files must be
removed manually.
- the character set and line separator conversion hooks
(get\_system\_linesep, get\_charset\_conv and get\_linesep\_conv)
have been removed. Similar functionality (probably based on
file type attributes) is planned and will be added in a future
release.
- update will switch to the branch of a given revision if it
differs from the current workspace branch.
- add will now accept combinations of --unknown, --recursive and
--no-respect-ignore.
- import now imports unknown directory trees properly.
- use SQLite 3.3.12.
- schema migrator rebuilt and will now properly detect and report
if the database used is created by a newer monotone than the one
currently used.
- removed the man page mtn.1, as it hadn't been updated for a long
time.
New features
- "mtn merge\_into\_workspace" (still to be documented). This command
will allow you to review and fix up a merge in your workspace
before committing it to the repository. However, the conflict
resolution interface remains the same as that of the 'merge'
command for now (i.e. monotone will invoke your specified merge
tool on all files with conflicts and you must resolve them as they
are presented). Work on in-workspace conflict presentation and
resolution is planned for the future.
- "mtn log" will now print an ASCII revision graph alongside the
usual log text.
Speed improvements
- "mtn annotate file" should run even faster now. it exploits
the fact that we store deltas of rosters. by peeking at
these deltas, it can avoid reconstruction of whole rosters
in many cases.
Other
- contrib/monotone-mirror.sh and
contrib/monotone-mirror-postaction-update.sh, two scripts
to mirror and update directories automatically.
- contrib/monotone-run-script-post-netsync.lua, to automatically
update a directory as soon as new revisions or certs arrive for
a given branch.
- contrib/monotone.bash\_completion had some improvemens.
- contrib/monotone.el had some improvements.
Internal
- Internally, the concept of "projects" has been introduced. It
currently doesn't mean anything, but will be used later, with
policy branches and similar.
Wed Dec 27 09:57:48 UTC 2006
0.32 release.
Changes
- "mtn serve" no longer takes patterns on the command line.
Use the permissions hooks instead.
- the name of the option that denoted the revision from which
"mtn log" should start logging was renamed from "--revision"
to "--from"
- author selectors no longer have implicit wildcarding
- if you manually add entries to MTN/log while you are
working, in preparation for an eventual commit, you will now
be required to remove a "magic" template line from the file
before the commit will succeed. This, like the test for an
empty log file, helps to prevent accidents.
- the "db regenerate\_caches" migration command replaces the
previous "db regenerate\_rosters", generalising the task of
rebuilding or generating cached data that may be added
across an upgrade. Like "db migrate", which upgrades the
database schema, this command fills in the data for new
features. In this release, as well as rosters, it also adds
"heights" information used to speed up topology operations.
Speed improvements
- "mtn annotate file" and "mtn log file" are generally much
faster now, dependant on the number of revisions that
changed the file. Both commands as well as "mtn automate
toposort" make use of data called "heights" caching the
topological order of all revisions. In order to create and
use this data, the following must be run once for each db
after upgrading:
$ mtn -d mydb.mtn db regenerate\_caches
New features
- "mtn automate content\_diff"
- "mtn automate get\_file\_of" (same as get\_file, but expects
a file path and optionally a revision)
- "mtn import" command
- "mtn log --to"
- netsync\_note\_\* hooks are given much more information,
inlcuding a http/smtp/etc style status code
- includedirpattern(dir, fileglob) function for hooks
Bugs fixed
- bug in "automate stdio" that would result in monotone
garbling its input in some circumstances fixed
- "mtn annotate file" and "mtn log file" are generally much
faster now, dependant on the number of revisions that
changed the file. Both commands as well as "mtn automate
toposort" make use of data called "heights" caching the
topological order of all revisions.
- spawn\_redirected hook function now understands a blank
filename to mean not to redirect that stream
- "mtn log" is now in proper topological order, also due to
the use of cached "heights" data
- reset options between "automate stdio" commands
- another compile fix for gcc3
- bug in localization code where option strings where not
always properly translated
Other
- botan library upgraded to 1.6.0
- accommodate changes in boost 1.34
- documentation for "mtn automate get\_option"
- notes/ directory
Sat Nov 11 11:06:44 PST 2006
0.31 release. Code cleanups and bug fixes.
New features:
- If multiple --message (or -m) arguments are passed to
'commit', then they will be concatenated on separate lines.
- The validate\_commit\_message hook is now told what branch the
commit is on.
Bugs fixed:
- The typo that prevented building with gcc 3.3 has been
fixed.
- Attempting to commit without a signing key available now
fails earlier.
- Command-line option parsing has been redone yet again; this
should fix a number of bugs caused by the use of
boost::program\_options. For instance, command line error
messages are now l10nized again, "--depth=asdf" now gives a
sensible error message instead of crashing, and --key= now
works as an alternative to -k "".
- A bug in the new roster caching logic that caused assertion
failures on very large trees has been fixed.
- A rare bug in the "epoch refinement" phase of the netsync
protocol has been fixed.
- Accidental (and undocumented) change to 'automate inventory'
output format reverted; documentation is now correct again.
- Some obscure error conditions with 'pivot\_root' fixed.
Many fixes to 'automate stdio':
- IO handling has been rewritten, to remove some
obscure bugs and clean up the code.
- automate commands can now take options (even when used with
'automate stdio').
- The default block size has been increased to 32k (which
should considerably reduce overhead).
- Many automate commands were flushing their output far too
often, causing major slowdowns when used with 'automate
stdio'; this has been fixed.
- Syntax errors now cause 'automate stdio' to exit, rather
than attempting to provide usage information for the calling
program to read.
Other:
- New large-coverage random testsuite for delta reconstruction
path finding algorithm.
- Miscellaneous code cleanups and improved error messages.
- Enhancements to debian packaging.
- New translation to es (Spanish).
Sun Sep 17 12:27:08 PDT 2006
0.30 release. Speed improvements, bug fixes, and improved
infrastructure.
Several internal data formats have changed with this release;
migration is straight-forward, but slightly more complicated
than usual:
-- The formats used to store some cached data in the
database have changed. To upgrade your databases, you
must run:
$ mtn -d mydb.mtn db migrate
$ mtn -d mydb.mtn db regenerate\_rosters
-- The metadata stored in \_MTN in each workspace has been
rearranged slightly. To upgrade your workspaces, you
must run
$ mtn migrate\_workspace
in each workspace.
All of these operations are completely lossless, and 0.30
remains compatible with earlier versions with regards to
netsync.
Speed improvements:
- Algorithm used to find branch heads rewritten, to use vastly
less memory and cpu. This not only makes 'mtn heads'
faster, but also 'mtn commit', 'mtn update', and other
commands, which were spending most of their time in this
code.
- The format used in the database to store the roster cache
was rewritten. This makes initial pull approximately twice
as fast, and somewhat improves the speed of restricted log,
annotate, and so on.
- The xdelta algorithm was further optimized.
- A memory leak in Botan was fixed, which was causing
excessive memory and CPU time to be spent during 'mtn
checkout'.
- Monotone has fast-paths for doing character set conversion
when the system it is running on uses plain ASCII. These
fast-paths now know that "646" is another name used for
ASCII, and systems that use this name (like some BSDs) now
benefit from the fast-paths.
- Miscellaneous other improvements.
Workspace format changes:
- It is now possible to write down a multi-parent (merge)
workspace. However, monotone will still refuse to work with
such a workspace, and there is no way to create one. This
change merely sets up infrastructure for further changes.
- \_MTN/revision no longer contains only the parent revision
id; if you depended on this in scripts, use 'mtn automate
get\_base\_revision\_id' instead. Also, \_MTN/work has been
removed.
UI changes:
- 'mtn status' now includes the branch name and parent
revision id in its output.
- The output of 'mtn annotate' and 'mtn annotate --brief' has
been switched. The more human-readable output is now the
default.
- 'mtn pluck' now gives an error message if the requested
operation would have no effect.
- On command line syntax errors, usage information is now
printed to stderr instead of stdout. (Output requested with
--help still goes to stdout.) This should make it easier to
find bugs in scripts.
Bug fixes:
- While changelog messages have always been defined to UTF-8,
we were not properly converting messages from the user's
locale. This has now been fixed.
- An off-by-one error that caused some operations to abort
with an error message about "cancel\_size <
pending\_writes\_size" has been fixed.
- In 0.29, --help output was not localized. This has been
fixed.
- In 0.29, setting merger = "emacs" would not work unless
EDITOR was also set to "emacs" (and similar for vi). This
has been fixed.
- A rare invariant violation seen when performing certain
sequences of renames/adds in the workspace has been fixed.
- If a user failed to resolve the conflicts in a text file, we
would continue asking them to resolve conflicts in remaining
files, even though the merge could not succeed. We now exit
immediately on failure.
- Work around some g++ 3.3 brokenness.
Documentation changes:
- Imported \*-merge documents into the manual (they still need
to be cleaned up to fit in better).
Changes to automate:
- Bug fix in 'attributes': this command is supposed to list
attributes that were removed from a file in the current
revision; instead, it was listing all attributes that had
ever been removed from that file. Now fixed.
- New command 'get\_corresponding\_path': given a revision A, a
path P, and a revision B, looks up the file with name P in
revision A, and states what path it had in revision B.
- New command 'get\_content\_changed': given a revision A and a
path P, gives the ancestor of A in which P was last
modified.
- New command 'get\_option': Fetches variables from
\_MTN/options (e.g., the current workspace's branch and
database).
- New command 'genkey': an automate-friendly way to generate a
new monotone key.
Sun Aug 20 15:58:08 PDT 2006
0.29 release. Code cleanups and bug fixes.
New features:
- The output of 'mtn status' has been changed significantly; the
output formerly used by 'mtn status --brief' has become the
default. For output similar to the old 'mtn status', see
'mtn automate get\_revision'.
- It is now significantly easier to control what merger
monotone uses to resolve conflicts; for instance, to use
emacs to resolve conflicts, add:
merger = "emacs"
to your .monotonerc file. To override temporarily, you can
also use the environment variable MTN\_MERGE, which takes the
same strings. Currently recognized strings are "kdiff3",
"xxdiff", "opendiff", "tortoisemerge", "emacs", "vim", and
"meld".
- Formerly, monotone's sync-over-ssh support required that an
absolute path be used, with a URL like:
ssh://venge.net/home/njs/my-db.mtn
The following syntaxes are now supported as well:
ssh://venge.net/~/my-db.mtn
ssh://venge.net/~njs/my-db.mtn
Bugs fixed:
- The bug where monotone would sometimes respond to a control-C
(or several other signals) by locking up and refusing to exit,
has been fixed.
- Monotone now properly respects SIGPIPE. In particular, this
means that 'mtn log | less' should now exit promptly when
'less' is exited.
- 'mtn log' now flushes its output after each message; this
makes 'mtn log ' significantly more usable.
- 'mtn log ' formerly listed irrelevant revisions (in
particular, any revision which contained a delete of any files
or directories, was always included). This has been fixed.
- If, during an update, two files both had conflicts, which,
when resolved, resulting the two files becoming identical, the
update would error out. This has been fixed.
- If \_MTN/log exists and does not end in a newline, we now add a
newline before using the log message. This removes a problem
where the string "MTN:" would end up appended to the last line
of the log message.
- We no longer buffer up an arbitrarily large number of pending
writes in the database. This improves speed and memory usage
for 'commit', and fixes the problem where 'cvs\_import' would
run out of memory.
- Monotone's tree walking code (used by 'ls unknown', 'ls
missing', and friends) now uses much less memory, especially
on reiserfs.
Automate changes:
- 'mtn automate stdio' now uses a configurable block size,
controlled by command-line option --automate-stdio-size. This
is mostly useful for testing speed/memory trade-offs.
- 'automate attributes' has a new format, which includes more
information.
Code cleanup:
- We now use boost::program\_options to parse command line
options, rather than popt. The only user-visible change
should be that --option="" no longer works as a way to set
some option to the empty string; use --option "". (This
change also removes a lot of orphaned and historically buggy
code from monotone.)
Other:
- zsh completion script significantly revised and updated (see
contrib/monotone.zsh\_completion).
Sat Jul 22 01:39:51 PDT 2006
0.28 release. Cherrypicking, a new testsuite, and some fixes
and enhancements.
New features:
- Cherrypicking with the new "pluck" command. This takes (a restricted
subset of) the changes in a revision, or between two
revisions, and applies them to your workspace. That this
has happened is not recorded in history; it as if you
happened to make some very similar changes by hand in your
workspace.
- New automate commands, "automate tags" and "automate branches".
- "diff" now knows how to find enclosing function (or
whatever) bodies, just like GNU diff's "-p" option.
-- The regex that defines "enclosing function" can be chosen
on a per-file basis by a hook function; the default hook
knows about LaTeX, Texinfo, and most programming
languages.
-- This is enabled by default; use --no-show-encloser to
disable.
Enhancements:
- When netsync fails due to permission errors, the server returns a
semi-intelligible message before dropping the connection.
- When merging a branch with 3 or more heads, the order in which to
merge the heads will now automatically be chosen to minimize
the amount of repeated work that must be done.
- Crash dumps are now written to $CONFDIR/dump when no workspace is
available
- Path validation routines are faster.
- Inodeprints should be slightly more robust now.
- New hook get\_mtn\_command, used to determine the path to the
mtn binary on a remote host, when using ssh support.
- "diff" now accepts "-u" and "-c" as short for "--unified"
(the default) and "--context", respectively.
Bug fixes:
- "revert --missing" now works when run in a subdirectory.
- "revert --missing" now works without any additional files
being specified. (You don't have to say "mtn revert
--missing .".)
- Fix an edge case where monotone would crash if there was a
content conflict in a merge for which there was no lca.
- Fix a case where netsync would sometimes hang during refinement.
- "mtn help" and "mtn --help" now exit with return code 0.
Build environment:
- automake 1.9 is now required.
- The testsuite has been rewritten, and should be much faster now. It
also no longer relies on the presence of a \*nix userland.
- Add workaround for gcc 4.1.[01] bug causing "multiple
definition" errors.
Internal:
- Restrictions have been split into path\_restrictions and
node\_restrictions, and generally cleaned up more.
Sat Jun 17 14:43:12 PDT 2006
0.27 release. Minor bug fixes and enhancements, plus ssh
support.
Major new features:
- Monotone can now push/pull/synchronize over arbitrary
bidirectional streams, not just raw TCP.
- File-to-file synchronization is enabled out of the box,
e.g.:
$ mtn -d db1.mtn sync file:/path/to/db2.mtn
- SSH synchronization is enabled out of the box, e.g.:
$ mtn -d local.mtn sync ssh://njs@venge.net/home/njs/remote.mtn
Note that this requires mtn be installed on the remote
computer, and locks the remote database while running; it
is not ideal for groups accessing a shared database.
- New protocols can be defined with Lua hooks -- for
example, someone could in principle make "$ mtn sync
xmpp://njs@jabber.org" do something interesting.
- See section "Other Transports" under "Advanced Uses" in the
for more details.
Minor new features:
- Selectors now support escaping, e.g., b:foo\/bar can be used
to refer to a branch with name "foo/bar" (normally / is a
metacharacter that separates multiple selectors).
- Visual C++ can now build monotone on Windows. (Mostly
important because it allows better Windows debugging.)
- --quiet now turns tickers off, and does not turn warnings
off. New option --reallyquiet disables warnings as well.
- New command 'automate common\_ancestors'.
- 'ls branches' now takes a pattern, e.g.:
$ mtn ls branches "\*contrib\*"
Speed improvements:
- Bug in select() loop fixed, server should no longer pause in
processing other clients while busy with one, but multiplex
fairly.
- The database has a new write buffer which gives significant
speed improvements in initial pulls by cancelling redundant
database writes.
- There's been a fair bit of performance tuning all around.
Bug fixes:
- Merge tools that exit in failure are now detected.
- Better reporting of operating system errors on Win32.
- Passphrases stored in ~/.monotonerc are no longer written to
the log file. (Passphrases entered at the terminal were
never written to the log file.)
- Fix sql injection bugs in selectors, making it safe to
expose slectors in web interfaces etc.
- Files marked with the mtn:execute attr now respect umask.
- 'automate' commands on Win32 now disable newline translation
on their output; this is especially important for 'automate
stdio'.
- 'db check' now calls the sqlite "PRAGMA integrity\_check", to
validate the integrity of things like sqlite indices.
- 'mtn annotate nonexistent-file' now gives a proper error
message, instead of an assertion error.
- 'mtn revert --missing' now works correctly when run in a
subdirectory.
- 'automate inventory' no longer fails when \_MTN/work contains
patch stanzas.
Other:
- Many, many internal code cleanups
- Including changes to somewhat reduce the size of the
binary
- New tutorial on using packets added to the manual
- Updated translations, improved error messages, etc.
Reliability considerations:
- In the two months since 0.26 was released, zero serious bugs
have been reported in the new code.
Sat Apr 8 19:33:35 PDT 2006
0.26 release. Major enhancements and internal rewrites.
Please read these notes carefully, as significant changes are
described. In particular, you \_cannot\_ upgrade to 0.26
without some attention to the migration, especially if you are
working on a project with other people. See UPGRADE for
details of this procedure.
The changes are large enough that there were 3 pre-releases of
this code; the changes that occurred in each can be seen
below. However, for the convenience of those following
releases, all changes since 0.25 will be summarized in these
release notes. There is no need to read the pre-release notes
individually.
Major changes since 0.25:
- The most user-visible change is that the default name of the
monotone binary has changed to 'mtn'. So, for example, you
would now run 'mtn checkout', 'mtn diff', 'mtn commit',
etc., instead of 'monotone checkout', 'monotone diff',
'monotone commit'.
- Similarly, the name of the workspace bookkeeping directory
has changed from "MT" to "\_MTN". As workspaces will
generally be recreated when migrating to this release,
this should not cause any problems.
- Similarly, built-in attrs like 'execute' have had 'mtn:'
prepended to their names. For example, executable files
should now have the attr 'mtn:execute' set to 'true' on
them. The migration code will automatically add this
prefix; no user intervention is needed.
- Similarly, the name of the ignore file has changed from
'.mt-ignore' to '.mtn-ignore'. The migration code will
automatically rename this file; no user intervention is
needed.
- Similarly, the recommended suffix for monotone db files is
now '.mtn'.
These changes are all purely cosmetic, and have no affect on
functionality.
- The most developer-visible change is that the data
structure for representing trees has been completely
replaced, and all related code rewritten. The new data
structure is called a 'roster'. You don't really need to
know this name; unless you are hacking on monotone or using
various debug operations, you will never see a roster.
It's mostly useful to know that when someone says something
about 'roster-enabled monotone' or the like, they're
referring to this body of new code.
This change has a number of consequences:
- The textual format for revisions and manifests changed.
There is no conceptual change, they still contain the same
information and work the same way. The formats were
merely cleaned up to correct various problems experience
showed us, and allow various enhancements now and in the
future. However, this change means that a flag-day
migration is required. See UPGRADE for details.
- Directories are now first-class objects. You can add an
empty directory, must drop a directory if you want it to
go away, etc.
- Attrs are now first-class objects. '.mt-attrs' no longer
exists; attrs are now described directly in the manifest,
and changes to them appear directly in revisions. The
migration code will automatically convert existing
.mt-attrs files to the new first-class attrs. If you have
custom attrs, those may require special handling -- if
this is the case, then the upgrader will tell you.
- The merge code has been rewritten completely. The
interface is currently the same (though this rewrite makes
it easier to improve the interface going forward); if you
have found merging in monotone to be easy in the past,
then you will not notice anything different. If you have
run into problems, then the new merger should make your
life substantially simpler. It has full support for
renames (of both directories and files), intelligent
merging of attrs, improved handling of file content
merges. Is the first known merger implementation based on
a provably correct algorithm (the "multi-\*-merge"
algorithm), has exhaustive automated tests, and generally
should give accurate, conservative merges.
- The new code is generally faster, though not yet as
fast as it could be.
Netsync changes:
- The default netsync port has changed 5253 to 4691. 4691 is
our official IANA-assigned port. Please adjust firewalls
appropriately.
- Netsync code has also been largely reworked; new code should
provide better opportunities for optimizations going
forward.
- The protocol is incompatible with earlier versions of
monotone. This should not be a surprise, since the data it
carries is also incompatible (see above)...
New features:
- New option --brief to 'annotate', gives somewhat more
friendly output.
- Several enhancements to log:
- New option --next, to display descendent revisions
(rather than ancestor revisions).
- When 'log -r' is given an ambiguous selector, it now just
logs all matching revisions, instead of requiring the
selector be disambiguated.
- New option --no-files.
- New command 'show\_conflicts', performs a dry run merge.
- New command 'ls changed'.
- 'rename' (and its alias 'mv') now accept a broader range of
syntax:
mtn rename foo some\_dir
-> renames foo to some\_dir/foo
mtn rename foo bar baz some\_dir
-> moves foo, bar, and baz to some\_dir/foo,
some\_dir/bar, and some\_dir/baz
- New hook 'validate\_commit\_message', which may be used to
verify that all commit messages meet arbitrary user-defined
rules.
- New option --log, to log monotone's output to a file.
- New option 'drop --recursive', to remove a directory and its
contents in one swoop.
- The root dir may now be renamed. This is a somewhat exotic
feature, but has some interesting uses related to splitting
up or joining together projects; see new commands
'pivot\_root', 'merge\_into\_dir'.
Minor bug fixes:
- 'serve' with no --bind argument should now work on systems
where the C library has IPv6 support, but the kernel does
not.
- Stricter checking on the internal version of filenames to
ensure that they are valid UTF-8.
- If the database is in the workspace, then it is always
ignored.
- Monotone no longer errors out when using a French (fr)
locale with a non-Unicode codeset.
Other changes:
- Packet commands ('rdata', 'fdata', etc.) have been moved to
'automate'.
- Database storage now uses sqlite's blob support; database
files should be ~1/4 smaller as a result.
- Monotone now uses sqlite 3.3; this means that older versions
of the command line client (e.g., an 'sqlite3' command built
against sqlite version 3.2) cannot be used to poke at a
monotone 0.26 database. Solution is to upgrade your sqlite3
program. Hopefully this is irrelevant to most users...
- Translations updated, and 3 new translations added (de, it,
sv).
Reliability considerations:
- This new codebase has received much less testing under real
world conditions than the codebase used in 0.25, simply
because it is newer. It has been in active use for monotone
development since 8 January 2006, and only a small number of
bugs have been found; all bugs found so far have been very
minor, and none stood any danger of corrupting data.
Furthermore, we are much more confident in the theoretical
underpinnings of the new approach than the old, and the test
suite attempts to exhaustively exercise all new code paths.
However, none of this is or can be a substitute for real
world experience. We advise caution in upgrading to this
version of monotone, and suggest that (especially) those who
upgrade aggressively should pay extra attention to the
monotone mailing list before and after doing so.
Wed Mar 29 05:20:10 PST 2006
0.26pre3 release. This release may be considered a "release
candidate", in that while we need to write some tests and make
sure some bugs are fixed, all features are in and we hope that
no further bug fixes will be needed either. It is still a
pre-release for testing. Do not package it. DO NOT USE THIS
RELEASE UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE A DAREDEVIL.
But, PLEASE PLEASE TEST this release. There are some
non-trivial changes since 0.26pre2, and this is your last
chance!
Major changes since 0.26pre2:
- The name of the monotone binary has changed to 'mtn'.
- Similarly, the name of the bookkeeping directory in
workspaces has changed from 'MT' to '\_MTN' (if you have an
existing 0.26-line workspace, just rename the MT directory
to \_MTN).
- Similarly, the name of the ignore file has changed from
".mt-ignore" to ".mtn-ignore". 'rosterify' will rename
these automatically (if you have already rosterified, you
get to rename them by hand).
- Similarly, the recommended suffix for monotone db files is
now ".mtn".
- We now perform stricter checking to make sure that filenames
are valid UTF-8. It is in principle possible that this
stricter checking will cause histories that used to work to
break; if you have non-ascii filenames, it is strongly
recommended to test with this release.
- Root dir renaming is now supported. See new commands
'pivot\_root', 'merge\_into\_dir'.
- As a side-effect, it is now possible to run 'rosterify' on
histories in which two independent lines of history were
merged.
- The security fix released in 0.25.2 has been forward-ported
to this release; this prevents some security exposure to
people running monotone as a client on case-insensitive file
systems.
Minor change since 0.26pre2:
- Database now uses sqlite blobs for storage; should be ~1/4
smaller.
- New command: show\_conflicts, does a dry-run merge.
- New option 'drop --recursive', to remove a directory and all
its contents in one swoop.
- Changes to 'log':
- New option --no-files
- Including merges is again the default (i.e., it now acts
like 0.25, and not like 0.26pre2).
- When 'log -r' is given an ambiguous selector, it now just
logs all matching revisions, instead of requiring the
selector be disambiguated.
- New option --log, to log monotone output to a file.
- Netsync changes:
- Was sending far too much data in some cases; now does not.
- Several bugs that caused it to lock up fixed
- Tweak to allow 'usher' proxy to transparently redirect
based on client's protocol version, to ease migration
between incompatible protocol versions.
- Packet commands have been moved to 'automate'.
- Fixed bugs in 'db kill\_rev\_locally', should no longer leave
an inconsistent db behind.
- Translation updates
Other projects receiving notable work:
- Monotone's "dumb server" support (repo distribution over
HTTP/FTP/SFTP etc.) has been ported to 0.26, a first command
line version written, etc.
- The 'usher' netsync proxy used for hosting many databases on
a single machine has received significant cleanups, and the
'webhost' project to provide a simple interface to shared
monotone hosting providers has received even more work.
Sat Feb 11 13:32:51 PST 2006
0.26pre2 release. Inching towards 0.26. If you are using
0.25 or earlier, then make sure to read the very important
notes for 0.26pre1, below. In particular, like 0.26pre1, this
is a pre-release for testing. Do not package it. DO NOT USE
THIS RELEASE UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE A DAREDEVIL.
(Though, in fact, in a month of usage, only one bug has been
found in the new history code, and it was both minor and
harmless. It has additionally been fixed.)
Database changes:
- SQLite 3.3.3 has been imported. 3.3 introduces a new database
format that is not backwards compatible with earlier 3.x releases.
New databases will be created using this new format. Existing
databases remain compatible, and are not converted automatically.
Existing databases can be converted by performing a database
vacuum ('monotone db execute vacuum').
New features:
- New hook validate\_commit\_message -- use to verify that all
commit messages meet arbitrary user-defined rules.
UI improvements:
- rename (and mv) commands now accept a broader range of
syntax:
monotone rename foo some\_dir
-> renames foo to some\_dir/foo
monotone rename foo bar baz some\_dir
-> moves foo, bar, and baz to some\_dir/foo,
some\_dir/bar, and some\_dir/baz
- Print a warning if it looks like a user has made a quoting
mistake on push/pull/sync/serve (windows cmd.exe has
confusing rules here).
- New command "ls changed".
- New option "--next" to log, which displays descendents of
the start revision.
- Updating to an arbitrary revision now works again (as it did
in 0.25 and earlier). This allows one to, for instance,
switch a working copy to another head, or back up to an
earlier version, while preserving uncommitted changes.
- New option --brief to annotate, gives somewhat more friendly
output.
- Fixed bug that made ticker output from netsync inaccurate.
- In 'log', --no-merges is now the default, use --merges to
override.
- If the database is in the working copy, then it is always
ignored.
Bugs:
- 'serve' with no --bind should now work on systems where the
C library has IPv6 support, but the kernel does not.
- Compile fixes for GCC 4.1 pre-releases.
Other:
- Better detection when users have not run "rosterify", and
more helpful suggestions on what to do in this case.
- Documentation, translation, error message,
etc. improvements.
- Updates to contrib/mtbrowse.sh, simple shell-based monotone
interface.
- Updates to many other contrib/ files, mostly to maintain
compatibility with monotone changes.
Sun Jan 8 01:08:56 PST 2006
0.26pre1 release. Massive rewrites, released for shakedown.
This release is also dedicated to Shweta Narayan.
This release includes massive changes compared to 0.25. The
core versioning code has all been replaced with a completely
different mechanism. Data formats and the netsync protocol
have changed in incompatible ways.
Migration to 0.26pre1 or later is irreversible and requires a
flag day for your project. See UPGRADE for details. Note
that we DO NOT recommend upgrading at this time; see below.
If you have been following the development list for the last
few months, you may have heard about "rosters" -- this is the
name for the new core data structure we use. While the code
is completely different, the user experience should not be
very different. You will never see a roster, unless you are
debugging monotone itself; everything still revolves around
revisions, manifests, and certs.
While this new code has extensive tests, because of these
incompatibilities, it has never been used for real work. The
purpose of this release is to make a version available for the
monotone developers to begin using for day-to-day work, to
shake out bugs.
Let's say that again in caps: THIS CODE IS PROBABLY BUGGY, DO
NOT USE IT IN PRODUCTION UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE A DAREDEVIL.
However, testing of this version with real databases is a good
idea, and we'd very much appreciate hearing about your
experiences.
Some of the many changes:
- New textual format for revisions and manifests; they remain
conceptually the same, but have been tweaked. Manifests
now use the same "basic\_io" format as everything else in
monotone, and contain entries for directories, revisions
record file adds slightly differently and record directory
adds for the first time, etc. Because of this format
change, revision hashes are now different; converting
rosters requires a full history rebuild and reissue of certs.
- Directories are now first class. To get rid of a directory
you must remove it; to create a directory, you must add it.
You can add an empty directory.
- Attrs are now first class. The .mt-attrs file is gone;
attributes are now stored directly in the manifest.
- New merge algorithm, based on "multi-\*-merge", and more
aggressive, less buggy merge ancestor selection code
- Netsync's core has been largely rewritten. Code is now much
clearer and more reliable, and now includes the ability to
resume interrupted partial transfers. The netsync protocol
version number has been bumped, and netsync now runs on the
IANA-assigned port 4691 by default.
- 100% fewer change\_set.cc related bugs. 100% more roster.cc
related bugs. But the idea of touching roster.cc does not
terrify people.
Thu Dec 29 23:10:03 PST 2005
0.25 release.
Incompatible command line changes:
- 'monotone revert' now requires an argument. To revert your
entire working copy,
$ monotone revert
no longer works; instead, go to the root of your working
copy and run
$ monotone revert .
New features:
- Netsync now supports IPv6 (where OS support exists)
Bugs fixed:
- 'revert' gives feedback describing what it changes
- Database locking further tweaked, to allow more concurrent
access in situations where this is safe.
- On win32, ticker display was fixed, so that it no longer
prints a new line at each update.
- 'read' can now understand (and migrate) privkey packets
generated by monotone version 0.23 or earlier.
- 'log --diffs ' now prints only diffs for the given
files (previously, it would print only revisions in which
the given files changed, but would print all diffs for those
revisions).
- Win9x and WinNT 4 compatibility fixes.
New translations:
- pt\_BR
Sat Nov 27 22:29:38 PST 2005
0.24 release.
Configuration change (Windows only):
- Configuration directory on Windows has changed. It used to
be some complicated and varying function of %HOME%,
%USERPROFILE%, %HOMEDRIVE%\%HOMEPATH%, whether you were
running in mingw/cygwin, etc. It is now, always,
%APPDATA%\monotone. For instance, if your configuration
file used to be named
...\Documents and Settings\user\.monotone\monotonerc
it will now be named
...\Documents and Settings\user\Application Data\monotone\monotonerc
Please rename files appropriately.
Major key management changes:
- Private keys are no longer stored in your database. They
are stored in ~/.monotone/keys/ (Unix, OS X) or
%APPDATA%\monotone\keys\ (Windows). 'db migrate' will
automatically move your keys out of your database and into
their proper location. Consequences:
- 'genkey' no longer requires a database. Simply run it
once when you first start using monotone, even before you
have created a database.
- Running 'genkey' once will suffice to give all databases
on one computer access to your key. No more fiddling with
'read'.
- When you want to make your key available on another
computer, simply copy over the appropriate file from your
'keys' directory to the corresponding directory on the new
computer.
- Private keys also use a more standard on-disk envelope
encoding ("PBE-PKCS5v20(SHA-1,TripleDES/CBC)") instead of
previous ARC4. More secure, and with extra crypto karma.
Netsync changes:
- Command line syntax for 'serve' changed; administrators WILL
have to adjust scripts.
monotone serve my.host.com "\*"
becomes
monotone serve --bind=my.host.com "\*"
or simply
monotone serve "\*"
(to serve on the default port, on all interfaces).
- Speaking of which, we can now bind to all interfaces; run
'serve' without passing --bind, or with passing
--bind=:port, and monotone will listen on all interfaces.
- New option '--key-to-push' for 'push', 'sync', allows
administrator to push a new user's public key into a running
server without restarting it.
- Netsync permission hooks have new defaults that read a
description of allowed access out of a standard,
basic\_io-based textfile (the same stanza-based format that
revisions use). Current hooks will continue to work, but
users may prefer to transition to this format; see manual
for details.
- Between these, it is now straightforward to change
permissions and add users without restarting your server.
- Improvements to experimental "usher" facility.
UI improvements:
- New convenience options "add --unknown", "drop --missing",
"revert --missing" do what you'd expect -- add all
non-ignored non-versioned files, drop all
deleted-but-undropped files, and restore all
deleted-but-undropped files, respectively.
- New selector "h:" to select heads of a branch. "h:" means
heads of current branch, "h:mybranch" means heads of
mybranch.
- Similarly, "b:" selector with no argument now refers to
current branch.
- Commit messages now have a blank line at the top so you can
start typing directly.
- No more obscure error messages when multiple monotone
processes attempt to access a single database at the same
time; we now fail early with a more sensible error message.
(Concurrent access has never caused database corruption;
this simply makes the corruption prevention less frustrating
for the user.)
- New handlers for SIGTERM, SIGINT to rollback database
transactions. Not visible to users (unless you're really
looking carefully). (Again, killing monotone has never been
able to cause database corruption; this simply causes the
transactions to be rolled back immediately, rather than the
next time monotone runs, which improves robustness in some
theoretical way.)
Changes in 'automate':
- New command 'automate keys' to get information on existing
keys in basic\_io format.
Updated translations:
- fr
Smaller changes:
- Improved handling of multibyte characters in message
displays.
- Fixes to Botan's memory allocator, to avoid pathological
slowdowns in some rare cases.
- Fix bug in delta-storage code; we were not being as aggressive
about delta-compressing files and manifests as we should
have been.
- Minor bugs fixed, error messages improved.
- Upgrading from 0.23: You must run 'db migrate' and
provide your password, for each database.
Fri Sep 30 02:50:05 PDT 2005
0.23 release.
Possibly incompatible changes:
- hook\_note\_commit and hook\_note\_netsync\_revision\_received
take a new argument containing the text of the revision that
was received. (Timothy Brownawell )
- 'cat FILENAME' now acts like the old 'cat file REV
FILENAME'; use new commands 'automate get\_revision',
'automate get\_manifest', 'automate get\_file' to fetch
objects by hash. (Grahame Bowland )
General improvements:
- .mt-ignore support (Martin Dvorak
, Timothy Brownawell )
- much work on making monotone more i18n friendly (BenoÃƒÂ®t
Dejean , Matt Johnston
)
- support for more interactive merge tools:
- FileMerge.app (comes with OS X) (Marcel van der Boom
)
- TortoiseMerge (Win32; comes with TortoiseSVN) (Matthew
Gregan )
- rename and drop now actually perform the specified rename or
deletion when the argument --execute is passed. (Richard
Levitte )
- 'help' command, same as --help (Matt Johnston
).
- 'usher' support: experimental method for proxying multiple
netsync servers through a single port (similar concept to
vhosts) (Timothy Brownawell )
- support long passphrases (Matt Johnston )
- Faster binary file detection (Eric Anderson
)
- netsync speedups:
- when handling large files (Eric Anderson
)
- when handling many branches (Marcel van der Boom
)
- new system to allow crash logs to contain not just execution
traces, but also dumps of data being handled when the error
was detected -- greatly improves debuggability of user
crashes.
- complete rework of path handling code, for clarity,
robustness, and speed. No user visible changes, except for
the many bugs fixed. (Special thanks to Matthew Gregan
 and Grahame Bowland
.)
- however, if you have non-normalized paths in your history
(symptom: fresh pulls with 0.18 work, but fresh pulls with
0.19 do not), then 0.23 will report an error and refuse to
handle the affected revisions. Since it is believed this
only affects one project, and to conserve core developer
time, implementing a migration was put off for now. If
this causes problems or for more details, please send an
email to monotone-devel@nongnu.org.
- as always, many small bug fixes, speedups, and improved
messages.
New translations:

Other new monotone-related projects since 0.22:
- mtsh by Timothy Brownawell:
https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/brownawe/www/mtsh/
GTK+ wrapper for monotone focusing on working copy
operations -- add/drop/revert/rename/commit/update/diff and
browsing. Has a mechanism for per-file commit comments.
- "dumb server" support by Nathaniel Smith (share your
monotone repositories via HTTP/FTP, no netsync daemon
needed):
http://viewmtn.angrygoats.net//branch.psp?branch=net.venge.monotone.dumb
Still needs a command-line frontend to be usable, among
other things. Help wanted. In python.
- m7 by Larry Hastings
http://www.midwinter.com/~lch/programming/m7/
Experimental drop-in command-line wrapper for monotone.
Uses certs to add local incrementing version numbers, and an
enhanced annotate front-end.
Mon Aug 8 23:23:53 PDT 2005
0.22 release. new crypto library, bug fixes, ui improvements
- switch from crypto++ to botan as underlying crypto library.
this should not cause any user-visible changes; let us know
if it does. special thanks to Matt Johnston
, Kaushik Veeraraghavan
, Matthew Gregan
.
- incompatible change to netsync permission hooks: the
get\_netsync\_anonymous\_read\_permitted hook has been removed;
instead, get\_netsync\_read\_permitted will be called with a
key name of nil. server administrators should update/review
their configuration
- new option for merge and propagate: --lca. Until we get a
long-term solution to the various 3-way merge problems, this
should be more convenient than using explicit\_merge.
- many small improvements to error messages, fixes of minor
annoyances, netsync tickers more accurate, etc.
Sun Jul 17 16:48:26 PDT 2005
0.21 release. bug fixes, performance improvements, and ui
improvements.
- fixes a number of major performance bugs in 0.20's netsync
implementation. special thanks to Matt Johnston
.
- fixes a number of major bugs in 0.20's (rewritten)
cvs\_import command.
- configury kluges to work around g++ 4.0/boost 1.32
incompatibilities. special thanks to Christof Petig
, Matthew Gregan
, Jordan Breeding
.
- ui enhancements:
- new netsync option "--exclude": branches are included if
they match any of the given globs, unless they match any
of the given --exclude globs. special thanks to Timothy
Brownawell .
- new netsync option client "--set-default": makes it easy
to change default server/branches.
- "diff" now takes options "--context" and "--external", to
output context diffs and to invoke an external diff
program for full control over output formatting. new
option "--diff-args" pass arguments to external diff
program; new hook "external\_diff" allows further
configuration. special thanks to Vladimir Vukicevic
.
- b: and t: selectors now match exactly, instead of matching
as substrings. globbing is supported for inexact
matching. special thanks to Brian Downing
, Jordan Breeding
.
- new command 'db kill\_tag\_locally'. special thanks to Jordan
Breeding .
- now uses sqlite3 prepared statements. special thanks to
Derek Scherger .
- 'db migrate' is now a complete no-op if there is no
migration to do; automated scripts can now call it
optimistically and cheaply to guarantee up-to-dateness.
- new hash correctness tests. special thanks to Kaushik
Veeraraghavan .
- upgrading from 0.20: you must run 'monotone db
migrate' once against each of your databases, to add
new sql indexes.
Tue Jul 5 23:57:10 PDT 2005
0.20 release. features, ui improvements, performance
improvements, and bug fixes.
- major changes in netsync UI: serve/sync/push/pull now take a
list of globs; clients can request arbitrary sets of
branches, not just predefined "collections". write
permissions are now granted on a per-db level (they were
before anyway).
- where you used to say, e.g., "monotone pull
net.venge.monotone", you should instead say
"monotone pull net.venge.monotone\*". This may
require shell-quoting.
- 'get\_netsync\_write\_permitted' hooks must be changed
to take only one argument, the 'identity'.
'get\_netsync\_{read,anonymous\_read}\_permitted' hooks
now take a branch argument instead of a collection,
and will be called for each branch that a client
requests.
- 0.19 clients cannot talk to 0.20 servers, and vice-versa.
- special thanks to Timothy Brownawell
, Richard Levitte
.
- other major changes:
- cvs\_import re-written; many bugs fixed. now
supports tags.
- many minor netsync changes:
- netsync traffic is now cryptographically authenticated
against corruption and man-in-the-middle attacks.
special thanks to Ethan Blanton ,
Matt Johnston .
- new hooks that are called when server receives data:
note\_netsync\_\*\_received. special thanks to Timothy
Brownawell .
- ancestry graphs that pass outside the given branch
are now synchronized correctly. special thanks to
Timothy Brownawell .
- UI improvements:
- 'log' options changed: --depth has become --last;
new options --no-merges, --diffs, --brief.
- 'status' has new option --brief. special thanks to
Derek Scherger .
- 'serve' has new option --pid-file. special thanks
to Matthew Gregan .
- all commands taking restrictions now take option
--depth, to limit recursion through subdirectories.
special thanks to Joel Reed .
- merge command all take --author, --date now.
- 'checkout', 'update' take --revision, instead of
using positional arguments. special thanks to Derek
Scherger , Richard Levitte
.
- 'commit' takes new --message-file option.
- new features:
- new commands: "db kill\_branch\_locally", "db
kill\_revision\_locally", useful for correcting some
mistakes. special thanks to Brian Campbell
, Sebastian Spaeth
.
- new file attribute 'manual\_merge', to prevent invocation of
merger on binary files. hook added to guess correct
value at 'add' time. special thanks to Riccardo
Ghetta .
- new 'earlier than', 'later than' selectors. special
thanks to Riccardo Ghetta .
- new automate commands:
- 'stdio', for efficient use by
front-ends. special thanks to Timothy Brownawell
.
- 'certs', for fetching certs on a revision in a
parseable (basic io-based) format. special thanks
to Grahame Bowland .
- 'inventory' output changed incompatibly; should be
much more usable now, and stable. special thanks to
Derek Scherger .
- better memory/performance when handling large files.
special thanks to Eric Anderson
, Timothy Brownawell
, Matt Johnston ,
Matthew Gregan .
- new text mode browser in contrib/mtbrowse.sh, by Henry
Nestler .
- improved zsh completion in contrib/monotone.zsh\_completion,
by Joel Reed .
- upgrading from 0.19: database and working copies are
fully compatible. netsync clients and servers need
to be upgraded together, as described above. the
many ui changes may require script updates.
Tue May 3 00:31:37 PDT 2005

no rule that such options must appear after the
command on the command line, though). Thanks to
Richard Levitte .
- bug fixes:

Bright , Emile Snyder
, Hansjoerg Lipp
, Matthew Gregan
.

Scherger , Linus Torvalds
.
- new concept: "database vars". Used in several features below.
- new features:
- new file "MT/log" can be edited while you work,
sets default changelog. (no change in behaviour if
you do not edit it.) Thanks to Jeremy Cowgar
.
- monotone now stores default netsync
server/collection, initialized on first use of
netsync.
- you no longer need to manually import server
keys, monotone will fetch the key from the server on
first netsync.
- monotone keeps track of keys of servers you have
previously synced with, to prevent man-in-the-middle
attacks.
- several powerful new "automate" commands added.
- new command 'ls known', lists files that are under version
control. Thanks to Florian Weimer .

debug dump to "MT/debug" for analysis, instead of
discarding.
- new contributed scripts: CIA (cia.navi.cx) notification,
email notification, Bash completion.
- 33 new integration tests. total line coverage: ~82%.
- many bug fixes
- Special thanks to Matt Johnston ,
for going above and beyond to track down the last
release blocker.
- upgrading from 0.17 requires only a 'db migrate'.

NOTE: this release expands the sqlite page size. YOU WILL NEED
to dump existing databases before upgrading and reload it
after upgrading, otherwise monotone will complain that the
database image appears malformed. this condition cannot
unfortunately be distinguished from a real malformed image on
disk. for example:
$ monotone --db=my.db db dump >dump.sql
$
$ mv my.db my.db.backup
$ monotone --db=my.db db load  8k

compatibility broken since 0.3. depot uses RSA signatures now,
not mac keys. many bugs removed. depot database compatibility
broken. database schemas should now remain stable (or be
provided with safe schema-upgrading function).

compatibility broken. dropped boost sandbox library dependency.
redid networking to support private HTTP+CGI depots along with
netnews. wrote depot. added 'propagate' command to move changes
between branches asymmetrically. rewrote testsuite in autotest.
cleaned up command line processing. expanded testsuite. improved
user-friendly error reporting.
Fri Aug 8 10:20:01 EDT 2003
0.2 release. database compatibility broken. dropped many
library dependencies. hand-reimplemented xdelta, parts of
nana. incorporated subset of cryptopp and sqlite into
sources. added RCS and CVS importer. switched to piecewise
reconstruction. generally much more robust storage system.
