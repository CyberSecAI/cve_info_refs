# Firefox Development

(from our [goals](/Firefox/Goals/2010Q4 "Firefox/Goals/2010Q4")):

# Firefox

* [AT RISK] Finish Firefox 4
  + 160 [Firefox/Toolkit blockers](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=blocking2.0%3Abeta,final%20prod:toolkit,firefox)

* [ON TRACK] API-Complete Jetpack
  + Joint with Jetpack team
  + Currently working towards feature-complete beta SDK

* [ON TRACK] Stand up basic Firefox with Electrolysis
  + Joint with Platform
  + UI may not be functional, should launch and open a web page.
  + [Project tracking page](/Electrolysis/Firefox "Electrolysis/Firefox")

# Developer Tools

* [NEW] Finish Firefox 4 developer tools
  + 15 [blocking developer tools bugs](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=blocking2.0%3Abeta,final%20prod:firefox%20comp:developer)

* [NEW] Ensure that Firefox 4 ships with a compatible version of Firebug

* [NEW] Publish a roadmap for integrated developer tools in Firefox, including console, inspection, and js debugging

* [NEW] Develop long term plan for Skywriter maintenance/support

# Platform

(there is a [team-by-team goals breakdown](/Platform/2010-Q4-Goals "Platform/2010-Q4-Goals"), as well)

* [MISSED] Finish Firefox 4 blockers.
* [DONE] Support Firefox Team to stand up a browser on Electrolysis.

* [MISSED] Ship Firefox 4 final with layers composition accelerated using:
  + OpenGL on Mac OS X;
    - This is turned on by default for all supported hardware, and there were few blocking bugs by the end of the year.
  + Direct3D on Windows.
    - This is turned on by default for all supported hardware, and there were few blocking bugs by the end of the year.
* [MISSED] Ship Firefox 4 final with content accelerated using Direct2D on Windows Vista/7.
  + - This is turned on by default for all supported hardware, and there were few blocking bugs by the end of the year.
* [MISSED] Ship Firefox 4 final with better Opentype font feature support using Harfbuzz on all tier-1 platforms, and text rendering performance equal to or better than Firefox 3.6.
  + We landed Linux Harfbuzz support before the end of the year, and there are no known text rendering regressions.
* [MISSED] Ship Firefox 4 final with full WebGL 1.0 support turned on by default on all platforms that support OpenGL.
  + We missed this goal because our WebGL implementation didn't pass all parts of the WebGL testsuite, which is required for "full WebGL 1.0 support." However, it is turned on by default for all supported hardware.

* [DONE] Integrate Opentype santizer library

* [MISSED] Play back video on Fennec without blocking on main content thread
* [DONE] Integrate codec ARM optimizations

* [MISSED] Ship indexedDB - indexedDB is done and landed, has been for some time. Minor bugfixing ongoing, but nothing beyond the norm.
* [MISSED] Ship HTML5 parser - Done, just didn't have anything to ship it in.
* [MISSED] Ship HTML5 forms (current set) - Done, just didn't have anything to ship it in.
* [MISSED] Ship GC compartments work - Done (though some bugfixing and GC work remains), just didn't have anything to ship it in.
* [MISSED] Proof of concept implementation of a proxy based DOM binding - Plan in place, but no work done here yet.
* [MISSED] 30% performance improvment on the Cal\_\* tests in Zimbra

* [DONE] Performance 15% improved over Oct 1 Sunspider perfomance

Improved over 30%.

* [DONE] Performance 15% improved over Oct 1 v8 performance

Improved over 30%.

* [MISSED] Continuous ARMv7 Android and Maemo JS Shell regression and performance testing in place

Have much better ARM testing than we used to, but not quit the JS shell regression tests we were hoping for.

* [MISSED] Drive blocker list to zero. [This was a super-stretch goal]
* [DONE] Develop implementation plan for OOP content accessibility. [Note it may change once we ramp up again post-FF4]

* [DONE] Fix and ship multi-process plugins on Mac
* [MISSED] Fix and ship asynchronous plugin painting on all plaforms
* [DONE] Fix and ship content processes on Fennec

# GFX

* [119 betaN, final, and Fennec blockers](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=comp%3Agfx%2Cgraphics%2Cimage%2Ccanvas%20-comp%3Axul%20blocking2%3A%2B%7Cblocking-fennec:%2B) (-4 w/w)
* OpenGL composited layers on Fennec update (jrmuizel)
  + Can be turned on (layers.accelerate-all pref) on trunk.
  + Known bug: Changing orientation of device, or resuming fennec, breaks all drawing.

# Layout

* Blocker count slowly dropping, now 103
  + Many bug fixes in hand

# Content

* Major remainders from compartment landing fixed (beta8 blockers). Many thanks to mrbkap and gal.

# Tree Management

* Fallout from our fun last week hunting down new orange caused by zombo.com DNS:
  + Friendly reminder that the [RelEng Sheriff](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering/Sheriffing) can re-trigger tests or even builds of specific changesets for you.
  + Cutting off external network access to test machines. See dev.tree-management thread [here](http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.tree-management/browse_thread/thread/f11512cae9b5875d)

* IT needs to rearrange test minis in the new colo. Proposed dates are December 17th, December 23rd. This will require a full working day with little or no test coverage. [bug 616658](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=616658)

* Win7 debug unit tests enabled
  + last known perma-orange for xpcshell - [bug 610654](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=610654)
  + who can make xpcshell run faster on Win7? [[1]](http://armenzg.blogspot.com/2010/12/test-suites-on-windows.html) It runs pretty slow. The other test suites did not get affected (except reftest a little bit)
    - xpcshell takes quite long on win7 and increases the end-to-end times
    - shall we keep on running xpcshell only on win2k3? shall we proceed with the switch? who can take ownership of making xpcshell faster on Windows 7?
    - we would like to stop running unit tests on win2k3 a couple of days after the last perma-orange on win7 gets fixed but this depends on answering the previous question.

# Roundtable

* Pulling WebSockets for Firefox 4 due to a security problem with proxy upgrade negotiation. (inherent problem with standard, spec in flux)
* String freeze: [[blocking with strings](https://bugzil.la/blocking2.0%3Abeta%2Cfinal%20sw%3Astrings)] has 10 bugs, 6 prelanded strings, 4 new strings. I'm losing track, [bug 616015](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=616015) and [bug 616014](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=616014) were filed without/wrong whiteboard and blocking+. (Axel) [[blocker noms with strings](https://bugzil.la/blocking2.0%3A%22?%22%20sw:strings)]
  + file bugs with [strings] in the whiteboard, request blocking, and CC :Pike. Johnath is to triage those.
* Blocker re-triage next week.
* Branching for Fennec4.0b3, Firefox4.0b8, and what branches to use so that post beta3/beta8 fixes can land, to be revisited later this week. (discussion in meeting with legneato, stuart, joduinn, catlee).

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
