Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-4997:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the Swoopo Clone 2010 application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection, which means an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into a query, leading to unintended database operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach/Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, read sensitive information, modify existing data, or even delete data.
- **Complete Compromise:** Depending on database privileges, a successful SQL injection attack could allow an attacker to take complete control over the database and potentially the underlying server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is `id` within the URL: `http://server/index.php?show=product&id=[sqli]`. The attacker crafts a malicious SQL injection string and inserts it into this URL parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. This typically means the attacker must have network connectivity to the server hosting the application.
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker must have some understanding of SQL to craft appropriate malicious injection strings.

**Additional Details:**
- **Vulnerable Application:** Swoopo Clone 2010
