{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the use of the `strcpy` function in the MDM Tool software component, which is susceptible to buffer overflows because it does not perform bounds checking.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause the device to crash and may be able to execute arbitrary code.",
     "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by sending specially crafted data to the MDM Tool software component.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send data to the affected software component. This may require network access to a vulnerable system or an ability to manipulate data that is consumed by the vulnerable software component."
