    "description": "The provided content contains information related to CVE-2010-4251.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause for this problem is, when the receiver is doing __release_sock() (i.e. after userspace recv, kernel udp_recvmsg->skb_free_datagram_locked->release_sock), it moves skbs from backlog to sk_receive_queue with the softirq enabled. In the above case, multiple busy senders will almost make it an endless loop. The skbs in the backlog end up eating all the system memory.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Unlimited socket backlog allowing for excessive memory consumption."
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive memory consumption by the socket backlog.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Sending a large amount of network traffic to a vulnerable system."
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to a system running a vulnerable kernel."

            "VMware ESXi and ESX",
            "Red Hat Enterprise Linux"
         ],
      "additional_notes": "The issue is not only for UDP. Any protocols using a socket backlog are potentially affected. The fix adds a limit for the socket backlog so that the backlog size cannot be expanded endlessly. This CVE is related to CVE-2010-4805 as well."
