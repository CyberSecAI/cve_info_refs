**Root Cause:**

The root cause is insecure coding practices within these third-party extensions, which led to SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities. Specifically, the `hm_tinymarket` extension also suffers from arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the database, potentially reading sensitive data or modifying data.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Could allow attackers to execute code on the server, potentially leading to full compromise of the server.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:** Could allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users, potentially leading to session hijacking or other malicious actions.

**Mitigation:**

The advisory recommends the following mitigation steps:

*   Uninstall vulnerable extensions if no updates are available.
*   Update to the latest version of the extension, if an update exists.
*   Follow the recommendations in the TYPO3 Security Cookbook.
*   Subscribe to the typo3-announce mailing list for future advisories.
