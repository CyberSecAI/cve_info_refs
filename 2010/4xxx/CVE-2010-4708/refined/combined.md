How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=641335#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2010-10-08 13:22:12 UTC  ``` It was reported that pam_env and pam_mail modules do not drop privileges before accessing users' files.  This flaw can lead to information disclosure.  Issue was partially addressed in Linux-PAM 1.1.2: <http://git.altlinux.org/people/ldv/packages/?p=pam.git;a=commitdiff;h=06f882f30092a39a1db867c9744b2ca8d60e4ad6>  The fix in 1.1.2 has some problems though, it fails to switch fsgid/egid and groups ([CVE-2010-3430](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-3430)) and does not check setfsuid() return value ([CVE-2010-3431](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-3431)): [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/3311/focus=3551](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/3311/focus%3D3551)  Fix using newly-introduced pam_modutil_drop_priv / pam_modutil_regain_priv was committed in upstream CVS and should be included in 1.1.3: <http://git.altlinux.org/people/ldv/packages/?p=pam.git;a=commitdiff;h=843807a3a90f52e7538be756616510730a24739a>  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Sebastian Krahmer of the SuSE Security Team for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=641335#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2010-10-08 14:00:04 UTC  ``` The impact here depends on the affected module and PAM version.  pam_mail supports checking mbox or Maildir format mailboxes for new mail.  By default, pam_mail checks mailboxes with path /var/mail/<username>.  This module does not open mailbox files, only performs following checks: - for mbox, checks if atime < mtime - for Maildir, checks if there are any files under new/ and cur/ directories  The information that can be leaked via this flaw is limited to knowing whether some file has more recent modification time than access time, or whether some directory is empty.  In Red Hat Enterprise Linux, pam_mail is not used by default.  Additionally, default /var/mail permissions do not allow non-privileged to create files in that directory (and hence replace their mailbox with symlink to file or directory for which they want to get the info mentioned above).  This can only affect non-default configurations where pam_mail is configured for some service and either /var/mail permissions are changed, or alternative mailbox path is configured (via pam_mail's dir option).  pam_env issue is related to user_envfile (~/.pam_environment by default) support.  This was introduced in Linux-PAM 1.0.90, it is not supported in PAM versions in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5.  User can exploit this flaw by symliking ~/.pam_environment to some other file that should be read by pam_env with root privileges and log in to the system.  Lines of the file that have expected KEY=VALUE form are made available to user via environment.  Conveniently for attacker, pam_env skips (with syslog message) all malformed lines, so it can be used to extract value even from files that do not have all lines with expected format.  Possible targets are shell scripts with hard-coded passwords (e.g. various backup scripts), or various INI file format configuration files (such as MySQL's my.cnf, that can contain database password; however, pam_env does not tolerate spaces around '=', which may be allowed in those INI files).   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=641335#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2010-10-08 20:23:15 UTC  ``` Referenced discussion on these PAM issues also points out that pam_env's intended behaviour of reading ~/.pam_environment is security risk that may lead to environment changes unexpected to the system administrator, service calling PAM, or subsequently consulted PAM modules:  [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/3311/focus=3562](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/3311/focus%3D3562)  pam_env does not directly change programs environment and only does changes to the environment associated with pam handle.  Application can later retrieve pam's environment via pam_getenvlist and export changes to its environment.  Other PAM modules can be affected if they use pam_getenv.  Given the default use of pam_env for multiple, shall we consider changing pam_env's user_readenv option default value to off?   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=641335#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2010-10-11 15:15:17 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=641335#c3)) > Given the default use of pam_env for multiple, shall we consider changing > pam_env's user_readenv option default value to off?

Following write-up covers another interesting attack vector, where this flaw is used to extract part of the SSH DSA private key, sufficiently large to compute the rest of the private key in a fairly short time:  <http://7bits.nl/projects/pamenv-dsakeys/pamenv-dsakeys.html>   ``` |  |

No, they are not fully fixed at all.  We're working on a patch (so you
don't need to).  The commit has the mentioned partial fixes only.

This is the same question asked different ways.  We have a patch that
we're reviewing internally.  To be made available soon.

The original pam_env and pam_mail issues, yes.  The partial fixes, no,
because there were no fixes at all before 1.1.2.

They're relatively minor because these modules are normally not used.
However, if the modules are used in a PAM stack on a given install, then
the original issues reported against pam_env and pam_mail by Sebastian
become major ones.

Additionally, as mentioned by Sebastian, pam_env's intended behavior is
a security risk (user-provided env vars may affect some services in ways
not expected by the sysadmin).  I am not sure how to deal with that.
Maybe improve the documentation.

# Linux-PAM: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201206-31**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Linux-PAM, allowing
local attackers to possibly gain escalated privileges, cause a Denial of
Service, corrupt data, or obtain sensitive information.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-libs/pam** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.1.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.1.5** |

### Background

Linux-PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) is an architecture allowing
the separation of the development of privilege granting software from the
development of secure and appropriate authentication schemes.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Linux-PAM. Please
review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A local attacker could use specially crafted files to cause a buffer
overflow, possibly resulting in privilege escalation or Denial of
Service. Furthermore, a local attacker could execute specially crafted
programs or symlink attacks, possibly resulting in data loss or
disclosure of sensitive information.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Linux-PAM users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-libs/pam-1.1.5"

```

NOTE: This is a legacy GLSA. Updates for all affected architectures are
available since November 25, 2011. It is likely that your system is
already no longer affected by this issue.
