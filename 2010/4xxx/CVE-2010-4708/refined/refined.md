Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `pam_env` and `pam_mail` modules in Linux-PAM not properly dropping privileges before accessing user files. This occurs because these modules, when processing user-specific files, execute with root privileges, which they retain improperly. Specifically, `pam_env` reads a user-controlled file (`~/.pam_environment`), while `pam_mail` checks the user's mailbox.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Privilege Dropping:** `pam_env` and `pam_mail` fail to drop root privileges when accessing user files, leading to potential information disclosure or other unintended consequences.
*   **Symlink Attack:** An attacker can create a symlink from their `~/.pam_environment` file to a target file they want to read with root privileges. Similarly, they could potentially manipulate their mailbox to obtain information using `pam_mail`.
*   **Information Disclosure:**
    *   Through `pam_mail`, an attacker could determine if a file has a more recent modification time than access time, or if a directory is empty.
    *   Through `pam_env`, the attacker could extract the contents of a file accessible by root, since the module parses files and makes environment variables available based on KEY=VALUE format within the file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information from files readable by root can be exposed by crafting specific files pointed to by `~/.pam_environment` or `pam_mail` configurations.
*  **Privilege Escalation**: Although not a direct privilege escalation, if the information exposed by `pam_env` contains sensitive data such as passwords (e.g. in backup scripts or configuration files), then this information can be used to escalate privileges on the target system.
*   **Potential Data Loss/Corruption:** While not directly described, the gentoo advisory mentions that a local attacker could use specially crafted programs or symlink attacks, which may lead to data loss or corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system.
*   **File Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to create files, symlinks, or manipulate their mail directory to exploit the vulnerabilities via `pam_env` and `pam_mail`.
*   **PAM Configuration:** Vulnerability depends on the PAM stack configuration - specifically if `pam_env` and `pam_mail` are used and default configurations are changed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a user account on the target system.
*   The attacker needs to be able to modify files within their own user space (e.g., `~/.pam_environment`, mail directory), or via other means affect file modification times.

**Additional Details:**

*   The `pam_env` module reads `~/.pam_environment` and makes variables available to the user via environment. Malformed lines are skipped.
*   The `pam_mail` module checks mailbox files for new mail.
*   The issue is partially addressed in Linux-PAM 1.1.2, but the fix has problems (related to CVE-2010-3430 and CVE-2010-3431) regarding switching `fsgid/egid` and groups and not checking the return value of `setfsuid()`.
*   A full fix, utilizing `pam_modutil_drop_priv`/`pam_modutil_regain_priv`, was committed upstream.
*   The default behavior of `pam_env` reading `~/.pam_environment` is considered a security risk and the default value of `user_readenv` was changed to off.
*   An attack vector using the flaw to extract part of SSH DSA private key was discovered.
