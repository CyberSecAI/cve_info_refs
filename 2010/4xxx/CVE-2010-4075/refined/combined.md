How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: Re: CVE request: multiple kernel stack memory
 disclosures

All,

I apologize for taking so long to handle this.  Dan, thanks for being
so diligent about digging up more information!  That couldn't have
been easy, let alone fun.

- Steve

CVE-2010-4073

========================================================================

<http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2010/10/06/6>

Author: Dan Rosenberg

Due to the high variation in affected kernel versions, most of these
are SPLIT.

>TIOCGICOUNT stack leaks:

(see <http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/9/16/294>)

>  usb/serial/mos*.c
>  Fixed in 2.6.36-rc5
>  Affects >= 2.6.19

CVE-2010-4074

>drivers/serial/serial_core.c
>Not fixed yet (Alan Cox's fix will be in 2.6.37)
>Affects >= 2.6.0

CVE-2010-4075

>drivers/char/amiserial.c
>Not fixed yet (Alan Cox's fix will be in 2.6.37)
>Affects >= 2.6.0, >= 2.4.0

CVE-2010-4076

>drivers/char/nozomi.c
>Not fixed yet (Alan Cox's fix will be in 2.6.37)
>Affects >= 2.6.25

CVE-2010-4077

>drivers/net/usb/hso.c (CVE-2010-3298)
>Fixed in 2.6.36-rc5
>Affects >= 2.6.29

Already assigned - CVE-2010-3298

>FBIOGET_VBLANK stack leaks:

>drivers/video/sis/sis_main.c
>Fixed in 2.6.36-rc6
>Affects >= 2.6.11

CVE-2010-4078

>drivers/video/ivtv/ivtvfb.c
>Not fixed yet (patch has been queued)
>Affects >= 2.6.24

CVE-2010-4079

>Miscellaneous device ioctl stack leaks:

>sound/pci/rme9652/hdsp*.c
>Fixed in 2.6.36-rc6
>Affects >= 2.6.0 (hdsp.c), >= 2.6.13 (hdspm.c)

These are SPLIT because the affected files are in different versions.

hdsp.c - CVE-2010-4080

hdspm.c - CVE-2010-4081

>drivers/video/via/ioctl.c
>Fixed in 2.6.36-rc5
>Affects >= 2.6.28

CVE-2010-4082

>drivers/net/cxgb3/cxgb3_main.c (CVE-2010-3296)
>Fixed in 2.6.36-rc5
>Affects >= 2.6.21

Already assigned - CVE-2010-3296

>drivers/net/eql.c (CVE-2010-3297)
>Fixed in 2.6.36-rc5
>Affects >= 2.6.0, >= 2.4.0

Already assigned - CVE-2010-3297

>System call stack leak:

>ipc/sem.c
>Not fixed yet (patch queued)
>Affects >= 2.6.0, >= 2.4.0

Presumably the lack of a current patch means this will affect a
different version than CVE-2010-4072 (ipc/shm.c shmctl), see above.

CVE-2010-4083

Subject: CVE request: multiple kernel stack memory disclosures

I'd like to request CVEs for a large series of Linux kernel stack
memory disclosure vulnerabilities, almost all of which have been
fixed.  They are all examples of declaring various structs on the
stack and copying them back to the user without filling in all the
fields, leaking uninitialized stack memory.  Since there are a lot of
issues here, I trust your judgment in deciding if they should each
receive a unique ID or if they should be combined in some way.  I
tried to break them up logically to make it easier.

---

The first batch of issues occurred in the TIOCGICOUNT device ioctls of
several device drivers.  While several of the issues were fixed on an
individual basis, Alan Cox fixed it for good by creating a new
handler.  Since these issues are essentially identical and were fixed
all at once, I think it might make sense to have them under a single
CVE.  Note that the final listed item in drivers/net/usb/hso.c was
already assigned CVE-2010-3298.

"The TIOCGICOUNT device ioctl in mos7720.c, mos7840.c, serial_core.c,
hso.c, amiserial.c, and nozomi.c allows unprivileged users to read
uninitialized stack memory, because the 'reserved' member of the
serial_icounter_struct struct declared on the stack is not altered or
zeroed before being copied back to the user."

Alan Cox's fix:
<http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/9/16/294>

drivers/usb/serial/mos*
<http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=a0846f1868b11cd827bdfeaf4527d8b1b1c0b098>

---

The next two issues both occurred in the FBIOGET_VBLANK device ioctl:

"The FBIOGET_VBLANK device ioctl in sis_main.c and ivtvfb.c allows
unprivileged users to read 16 bytes of uninitialized stack memory,
because the 'reserved' member of the fb_vblank struct declared on the
stack is not altered or zeroed before being copied back to the user."

drivers/video/sis/sis_main.c
<http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=fd02db9de73faebc51240619c7c7f99bee9f65c7>

drivers/media/video/ivtv/ivtvfb.c
lkml.org/lkml/2010/9/15/393

---

The following issues occured in miscellaneous device ioctls in a
variety of drivers.  Note the final two items listed have already been
assigned CVE-2010-3296 and CVE-2010-3297 - I include them only for
reference.

sound/pci/rme9652/hdsp*.c
<http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=128542726922720&w=2>

"The SNDRV_HDSP_IOCTL_GET_CONFIG_INFO and
SNDRV_HDSP_IOCTL_GET_CONFIG_INFO ioctls in hdspm.c and hdsp.c allow
unprivileged users to read uninitialized kernel stack memory, because
several fields of the hdsp{m}_config_info structs declared on the
stack are not altered or zeroed before being copied back to the user."

drivers/video/via/ioctl.c
<http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=b4aaa78f4c2f9cde2f335b14f4ca30b01f9651ca>

"The VIAFB_GET_INFO device ioctl allows unprivileged users to read 246
bytes of uninitialized stack memory, because the 'reserved' member of
the viafb_ioctl_info struct declared on the stack is not altered or
zeroed before being copied back to the user."

drivers/net/cxgb3/cxgb3_main.c (CVE-2010-3296)
<http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=49c37c0334a9b85d30ab3d6b5d1acb05ef2ef6de>

"The CHELSIO_GET_QSET_NUM device ioctl allows unprivileged users to
read 4 bytes of uninitialized stack memory, because the 'addr' member
of the ch_reg struct declared on the stack in cxgb_extension_ioctl()
is not altered or zeroed before being copied back to the user."  This
issue was assigned CVE-2010-3296.

drivers/net/eql.c (CVE-2010-3297)
<http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=44467187dc22fdd33a1a06ea0ba86ce20be3fe3c>

"The EQL_GETMASTRCFG device ioctl allows unprivileged users to read 16
bytes of uninitialized stack memory, because the 'master_name' member
of the master_config_t struct declared on the stack in
eql_g_master_cfg() is not altered or zeroed before being copied back
to the user."  This issue was assigned CVE-2010-3297.

---

The final identified leak is in the sys_semctl system call, which I
would say is more serious since it is not driver-specific:

ipc/sem.c
<http://www.spinics.net/lists/mm-commits/msg80234.html>

"The semctl syscall has several code paths that lead to the leakage of
uninitialized kernel stack memory (namely the IPC_INFO, SEM_INFO,
IPC_STAT, and SEM_STAT commands) during the use of the older, obsolete
version of the semid_ds struct.  The copy_semid_to_user() function
declares a semid_ds struct on the stack and copies it back to the user
without initializing or zeroing the 'sem_base', 'sem_pending',
'sem_pending_last', and 'undo' pointers, allowing the leakage of 16
bytes of kernel stack memory.  The code is still reachable on 32-bit
systems - when calling semctl() newer glibc's automatically OR the IPC
command with the IPC_64 flag, but invoking the syscall directly allows
users to use the older versions of the struct."

---

Let me know if you have any questions or need any clarification on any
of these issues.

Regards,
Dan

# [PATCH] drivers/serial/serial\_core.c: prevent readinguninitialized stack memory

**From:** Dan Rosenberg

**Date:**  Wed Sep 15 2010 - 17:50:51 EST

* **Next message:**   [Dan Rosenberg: "[PATCH] drivers/usb/serial/mos\*: prevent reading uninitializedstack memory"](03389.html)* **Previous message:**   [Dan Rosenberg: "[PATCH] drivers/char/nozomi.c: prevent reading uninitialized stackmemory"](03387.html)* **Messages sorted by:** [[ date ]](date.html#03388) [[ thread ]](index.html#03388) [[ subject ]](subject.html#03388) [[ author ]](author.html#03388)

The TIOCGICOUNT device ioctl allows unprivileged users to read

uninitialized stack memory, because the "reserved" member of the

serial\_icounter\_struct struct declared on the stack is not altered or

zeroed before being copied back to the user. This patch takes care of

it.

Subject: Re: CVE request: multiple kernel stack memory disclosures

I'll omit descriptions here to save space, since they were already
provided.  I'll keep the same organization as last time, just to make
it easier.  Issues that haven't been fixed yet are for the most part
planned for 2.6.37.  Patches were submitted for all issues, so it's
mostly just a matter of time.

Subject: Re: CVE request: multiple kernel stack memory disclosures

While these are pending, a few more of the same problem (uninitialized
structure members being copied back to userspace, leaking kernel stack
memory) have come up.  These are similar or related to the previous
ipc/sem.c leak.

ipc/shm.c (shmctl), reported and fixed by Kees Cook
Affects >= 2.6.0, >= 2.4.0

Reference:
<http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/10/6/454>

ipc/compat.c (compat versions of semctl, shmctl, and msgctl)
Affects >= 2.6.8

ipc/compat_mq (compat versions of mq_open and mq_getsetattr)
Affects >= 2.6.8

Reference:
<http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/10/6/492>
