# 3.2.9, 3.4.9, 3.6.3, and and 4.0rc1 Security Advisory

Monday, Jan 24th, 2011
```

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* A weakness in Bugzilla could allow a user to gain unauthorized access
  to another Bugzilla account.

* A weakness in the Perl CGI.pm module allows injecting HTTP headers
  and content to users via several pages in Bugzilla.

* The new user autocomplete functionality in Bugzilla 4.0 is vulnerable
  to a cross-site scripting attack.

* The new automatic duplicate detection functionality in Bugzilla 4.0
  is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack.

* If you put a harmful "javascript:" or "data:" URL into Bugzilla's
  "URL" field, then there are multiple situations in which Bugzilla
  will unintentionally make that link clickable.

* Various pages lack protection against cross-site request forgeries.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Account Compromise
Affected:    2.14 to 3.2.9, 3.4.9, 3.6.3, 4.0rc1
Fixed In:    3.2.10, 3.4.10, 3.6.4, 4.0rc2
Description: It was possible for a user to gain unauthorized access to
             any Bugzilla account in a very short amount of time (short
             enough that the attack is highly effective). This is a
             critical vulnerability that should be patched immediately
             by all Bugzilla installations.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=621591
             https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=619594
CVE Number:  CVE-2010-4568

Class:       HTTP Response Splitting
Affected:    Every Version Before 3.2.10, 3.4.10, 3.6.4, 4.0rc2
Fixed In:    3.2.10, 3.4.10, 3.6.4, 4.0rc2
Description: By inserting particular strings into certain URLs, it was
             possible to inject both headers and content to any
             browser.

             http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/113.html
CVE Number:  CVE-2010-2761, CVE-2010-4411, CVE-2010-4572

Class:       Cross-Site Scripting
Affected:    3.7.1 to 4.0rc1
Fixed In:    4.0rc2
Description: Bugzilla 3.7.x and 4.0rc1 have a new client-side
             autocomplete mechanism for all fields where a username
             is entered. This mechanism was vulnerable to a cross-site
             scripting attack.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=619637
CVE Number:  CVE-2010-4569

Class:       Cross-Site Scripting
Affected:    3.7.1 to 4.0rc1
Fixed In:    4.0rc2
Description: Bugzilla 3.7.x and 4.0rc1 have a new mechanism on the
             bug entry page for automatically detecting if the bug
             you are filing is a duplicate of another existing bug.
             This mechanism was vulnerable to a cross-site scripting
             attack.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=619648
CVE Number:  CVE-2010-4570

Class:       Cross-Site Scripting
Affected:    Every Version Before 3.2.10, 3.4.10, 3.6.4, 4.0rc2
Fixed In:    3.2.10, 3.4.10, 3.6.4, 4.0rc2
Description: Bugzilla has a "URL" field that can contain several types
             of URL, including "javascript:" and "data:" URLs. However,
             it does not make "javascript:" and "data:" URLs into
             clickable links, to protect against cross-site scripting
             attacks or other attacks. It was possible to bypass this
             protection by adding spaces into the URL in places that
             Bugzilla did not expect them. Also, "javascript:" and
             "data:" links were *always- summary: |-
             shown as clickable to
             logged-out users.

             https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=628034
CVE Number:  CVE-2010-4567, CVE-2011-0048

Class:       Cross-Site Request Forgery
Affected:    Every Version Before 3.2.10, 3.4.10, 3.6.4, 4.0rc2
Fixed In:    3.2.10, 3.4.10, 3.6.4, 4.0rc2
Description: Various pages were vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
             Forgery attacks. Most of these issues are not as serious
             as previous CSRF vulnerabilities. Some of these issues
             were only addressed on more recent branches of Bugzilla
             and not fixed in earlier branches, in order to avoid
             changing behavior that external applications may depend
             on. The links below in "References" describe which issues
             were fixed on which branches.

User Interface
▾

Bugzilla :: User Interface
General issues having to do with the user interface. This includes both presentation (how it looks) and behavior (how it works) but not functionality (what it does), which should be filed in a function-specific component like Email Notifications or in Bugzilla-General. Examples of bugs you might file here include column label "Pri" is confusing and take anonymous users to the simple query page by default but not need way to filter for requests with no requestee.
As a general rule, bugs that affect only a single Bugzilla web page or can be fixed with changes just to templates probably go in this component, while bugs that affect multiple pages or fixes to Perl code probably go somewhere else.

If a user's real name field happens to contain XSS, the user autocomplete UI will happily execute it, as it does no escaping of any potential valid HTML.

Isn't there some built-in HTML escaper in YUI?

Not that I can see from poking around.

We override the formatter anyway, so we'd still be vulnerable. I'll just modify our code to use their util function or whatever they offer.

This patch does what reed wants it to do, which is escape incoming HTML, however, i'm not an XXS attack expert and I feel uncomfortable saying that this solution will stop all possible XXS attacks. But the attached patch (patch - v1), does escape incoming text that he lists in his code. Not sure if this is helpful or not.
Basically the code looks good, my knowledge of the numerous ways to do a XXS attack are to limited to know if this patch is enough to stop the behavior in question.

patch - v1
This does look correct and it's the same as what YUI does, so at the least we will be just as secure as the DataTable text formatter.

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.
