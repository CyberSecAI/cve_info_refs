{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The user autocomplete functionality in Bugzilla versions 3.7.1 to 4.0rc1 does not properly encode user names, which can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser by injecting malicious script in user names, potentially leading to account compromise or other malicious actions.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can insert malicious JavaScript into the 'real name' field of a Bugzilla account. When that user's name is displayed in the autocomplete UI, the script is executed.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a Bugzilla account and the ability to modify their 'real name' field. The attacker can be a low privileged user of Bugzilla."
