Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the authentication system of the "Pointter PHP Micro-Blogging Social Network". The application incorrectly grants administrative privileges based on the mere presence of specific cookies ('auser' and 'apass'), regardless of their values.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insufficient Authentication:** The application's authentication mechanism relies on the existence of cookies rather than validating their content against stored credentials or using a secure session management system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  An attacker can bypass the intended authentication and obtain administrative access by crafting arbitrary cookies.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Full Administrative Access:** Successful exploitation grants the attacker complete administrative control over the application.
*   **Data Breaches and Manipulation:** An attacker with administrative access could potentially modify, delete, or steal sensitive data stored within the application.
*   **Malicious Actions:** Attackers could deface the application, inject malicious code, or perform other harmful actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Cookie Manipulation:** The attacker crafts HTTP cookies ('auser' and 'apass') with arbitrary values and sends them in a request to the web server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP requests with custom cookies to the vulnerable application. This typically means they need to be able to interact with the web server through a web browser or other HTTP client.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vendor's response indicates a lack of understanding of basic security principles by suggesting that renaming the admin folder is a sufficient security measure, and shifting responsibility for security onto the users.
*   The vulnerability was found in version 1.8 of "Pointter PHP Micro-Blogging Social Network".
*   No update was available at the time of disclosure.
