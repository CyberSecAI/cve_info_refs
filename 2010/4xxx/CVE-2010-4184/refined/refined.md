Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The NetSupport HTTP protocol implementation, used for communication between the NetSupport Manager Gateway and NetSupport Manager Controls/Clients, transmits HTTP headers in plaintext.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Plaintext Transmission:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of encryption for HTTP headers transmitted between systems. This exposes sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could intercept and view plaintext headers, gaining access to identification information about client machines.
*   **Specifically Disclosed Information:** This includes the client's IP address, hardware MAC address, the logged-in user's name, and potentially password hashes (although this is stated to be not transmitted in plain text in one of the content sources).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Sniffing:** An attacker positioned on the network could passively sniff traffic between the NetSupport Manager Gateway and Controls/Clients to capture the unencrypted HTTP headers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network or have the ability to intercept network traffic between the NetSupport components.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Components:** NetSupport Manager Gateway, NetSupport Manager Controls, and NetSupport Manager Clients.
*   **Vulnerable Versions:** NetSupport Manager versions prior to 11.00.0005.
*   **Mitigation:** Upgrading to NetSupport Manager version 11.00.0005 or later resolves the vulnerability by encrypting all header communication.
*   **Vendor Provided Fix:** The vendor has introduced configuration options in the Gateway:
    *   **Enable encryption of communications:** Encrypts headers for communication with version 11.00.0005 or later.
    *   **Block any remote computers not using encrypted communications:** Blocks connections from older versions that don't support encryption.
