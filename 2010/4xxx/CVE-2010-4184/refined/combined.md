## NetSupport Manager Gateway transmits identifying information in plaintext

#### Vulnerability Note VU#465239

Original Release Date: 2010-11-03 | Last Revised: 2010-11-03

---

### Overview

The NetSupport HTTP protocol implementation used for communication between the NetSupport Manager Gateway and NetSupport Manager Controls or NetSupport Manager Clients is not encrypting http headers sent between systems.

### Description

| The NetSupport HTTP protocol implementation used for communication between the NetSupport Manager Gateway and NetSupport Manager Controls or NetSupport Manager Clients is sending plaintext http headers between systems. The header of some of the NetSupport HTTP packets contain information in plaintext that could be used to identify information about the client machine. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker could view identification information about the client machine such as the client's ip address, hardware MAC address, user's login name, and password hash. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**  According to the vendor's [technical document](http://www.netsupportsoftware.com/support/td.asp?td=634) the NetSupport HTTP protocol implementation has been updated so that all header communication is now encrypted in the current shipping version of the NetSupport Manager product (version 11.00.0005). Additional information is available in the Vendors Affected section of this document. |

### [NetSupport Ltd](#MORO-896GDL) Affected

Updated:  September 10, 2010

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

The vendor has stated the following regarding this vulnerability.

*The NetSupport Manager Gateway now has two additional configuration options available on the Security Tab of the Gateway configuration utility these are detailed below*

*Enable encryption of communications to remote computers*
*This option is checked by default and enables the encryption of all Header information when communicating with Clients or Controls that are version 11.00.0005 or later. Clients and Controls from previous versions will still be able to communicate however, communications with older versions will contain unencrypted data in the header.*

*Block any remote computers not using encrypted communications*
*When checked this option communication from older versions that do not support the enhanced level of encryption will be blocked. Thus any Client or Control prior to version 11.00.0005 will no longer connect to this Gateway.*

### Vendor Information

We are not aware of further vendor information regarding this vulnerability.

A security issue has been identified with the NetSupport HTTP protocol implementation used for communication between the NetSupport Manager Gateway (Connectivity Server) and NetSupport Manager Controls or Clients. The header of some of the NetSupport HTTP packets contained some information in plain text that could be used to identify information about the Client machine. The unencrypted data describes the Client’s IP address, the hardware MAC address and the logged on users name.

No password or security key information was transmitted in plain text.

The issue is resolved in NetSupport Manager 11.00.0005 or later. The NetSupport HTTP protocol implementation has been updated and no information is sent in plain text and all information is encrypted.

If you are concerned by this issue, we advise you update all NetSupport Gateways, Clients and Controls to version 11.00.0005 or later.

The NetSupport Manager Gateway now has two additional configuration options available in the Security tab of the Connectivity Server configuration.

![](https://kb.netsupportsoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Gateway-Security.png)

**Enable encryption of communications to remote computers**
This option is enabled by default and encrypts all header information when communicating with Clients or Controls that are running version 11.00.0005 or later. Clients and Controls from previous versions will still be able to communicate; however, communications with older versions will contain unencrypted data in the header.

**Block any remote computers not using encrypted communications**
When enabled, this option will block connections from versions of the Control or Client that do not support the enhanced level of encryption. So, any Client or Control before version 11.00.0005 will no longer connect to this Gateway.
