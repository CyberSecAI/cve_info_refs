    "related": true,
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The `glob(3)` function in libc does not properly limit resource usage when expanding filename wildcards, particularly when using patterns like `*/../*/../...` or `*/{..,..,..}/*/{..,..,..}/...`. The `GLOB_LIMIT` intended to prevent denial of service attacks is insufficient because it doesn't limit `readdir(3)` calls, `stat(2)` calls, or memory usage when no matches are found. This can cause excessive CPU utilization or memory exhaustion.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Resource exhaustion: Excessive calls to `readdir(3)` and `stat(2)`, leading to high CPU utilization.",
        "Memory exhaustion: Allocation of a large number of path strings."
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS): The vulnerability can lead to a crash, kernel panic, or service unavailability due to resource exhaustion. This affects services using `glob(3)`, such as `ftpd` and `sftp-server`.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote exploitation through `ftpd` by sending a crafted STAT command with a malicious wildcard pattern.",
         "Remote exploitation through `sftp-server` by sending a malicious wildcard pattern."
      ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send commands to an FTP server or SFTP server. This does not require authentication if the server is setup to allow anonymous logins for ftp."
