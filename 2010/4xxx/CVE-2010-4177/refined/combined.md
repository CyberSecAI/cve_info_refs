Please see <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2010/11/16/6>

I don't know if MySQL provides such a facility, but it should pass
the password through a file.

Cheers,

Subject: mysql-gui-tools was removed from Debian in 2012
Date: Sun, 3 Jul 2016 22:33:17 +0200
```
Version: 5.0r14+openSUSE-2.3+rm

mysql-gui-tools was last released with Debian 6.0 (squeeze) in
February 2011 and removed from Debian sid/unstable in 2012 (see
<http://bugs.debian.org/584987> for details on the removal). Since
support for squeeze and squeeze-LTS has now ended, I'm closing all the
remaining bugs reported against this package.

Andreas

Subject: Clear text password in process list when using MySQL GUI tools

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi ML.

If you use some MySQL-GUI-tool in most (any?) linux distribution like
mysql-admin or mysql-query-browser and then open 'Tools -> MySQL Text
Console' your password, user name and host will become exposed in the
process list.

I think this issue must exists over a long time in many distributions
now but nobody ever cared about.

For Debian users:
Packages mysql-query-browser, mysql-admin are affected.

So far, Martin

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=655015#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-11-19 11:16:40 UTC  ``` Martin Drescher pointed out a deficiency in the way mysql-query-browser launched MySQL Text Console after user's MySQL connection to the MySQL server. A local attacker could use this flaw to view the password of the user, connected to the MySQL server, in the clear text form via the list of running processes.  References: [1] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2010/11/16/6> [2] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2010/11/18/2>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=655015#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-11-19 11:18:06 UTC  ``` This issue affects the version of the mysql-gui-tools package, as shipped with Fedora release of 12.  Please fix.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=655015#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-11-19 11:25:57 UTC  ``` Created mysql-gui-tools tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-12 [[bug 655018](show_bug.cgi?id=655018 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2010-4177 CVE-2010-4178 mysql-gui-tools various flaws [fedora-12]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=655015#c4)  Pavel Alexeev    2010-11-19 17:08:33 UTC  ``` musql-gui-tools is dead package. It is not supported upstream many times and it is not Fedora start from 13. I do not want even see on it. Fedora 12 in few days reached EOL. So, I suggest close it.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=655015#c5)  Dennis Gilmore    2011-06-16 22:48:49 UTC  ``` old package replaced by mysql-workbench   ``` |  |
