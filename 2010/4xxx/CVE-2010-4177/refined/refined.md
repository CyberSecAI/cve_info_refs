{
  "CVE-2010-4177": {
    "Description": "mysql-gui-tools (mysql-query-browser and mysql-admin) before 5.0r14+openSUSE-2.3 exposes the password of a user connected to the MySQL server in clear text form via the list of running processes.",
    "Root cause": "The mysql-gui-tools, specifically mysql-query-browser and mysql-admin, when launching the MySQL text console, passes the database credentials (including the password) as command-line arguments which are visible in the process list.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Exposure of sensitive information",
      "Insecure handling of credentials"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker with local access to the system can view the database password in clear text, allowing them to gain unauthorized access to the MySQL server.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access to the system where mysql-gui-tools is running.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to have local access to the system to view the process list.  Low privileges are sufficient to see the process list.",
    "Additional Information": [
      "The vulnerability occurs when the 'MySQL Text Console' feature is used.",
      "The issue was present in multiple distributions, but it was reported to be fixed in version 5.0r14+openSUSE-2.3.",
     "The issue is considered a moderate severity."
