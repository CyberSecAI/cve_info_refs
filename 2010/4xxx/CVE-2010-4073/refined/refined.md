Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2010-4073:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly initialize structure members within the System V shared memory subsystem, specifically in the `ipc/compat.c` file within the Linux kernel. This issue occurs in the compatibility versions of `semctl`, `shmctl`, and `msgctl` system calls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Uninitialized Memory Leak:** When the system makes calls to `semctl`, `shmctl`, and `msgctl` through the compatibility layer, parts of kernel memory are copied to the user space. Due to the lack of initialization, the returned data from these structures may contain potentially sensitive data present on the kernel stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:**  A successful exploit of this vulnerability allows a local, unprivileged user to read contents of kernel stack memory, possibly exposing sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by local users who have the capability to call the affected system calls.
*   **System Call Interface:** The attack vector involves the use of the `semctl`, `shmctl`, and `msgctl` system calls using the compat versions on 64-bit systems.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must have a user account on the system where the vulnerable kernel is running.
*   **Ability to Invoke System Calls:** The attacker needs the capability to call the relevant system calls ( `semctl`, `shmctl`, and `msgctl`) in their compat versions.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability affects 64-bit systems making 32-bit compatible system calls.
*   The issue is specifically related to the Linux kernel and how it manages shared memory within the System V IPC mechanism when using the compatibility layer.
*   The fix involves ensuring that the structure members are properly initialized or zeroed out before returning data to user space.
*   Several sources mention that the vulnerability has been resolved by patches in affected systems.
*   The vulnerability exists in Linux kernel versions >= 2.6.8.
