```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the `carsdetail.asp?arac` and `twohandscars.asp?marka` parameters.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection.
- Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to read, modify or delete data in the database, potentially leading to complete compromise of the application and its underlying infrastructure.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending specially crafted SQL queries through the vulnerable parameters `arac` and `marka` in the `carsdetail.asp` and `twohandscars.asp` pages respectively.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No special capabilities or positioning is required, aside from the ability to interact with the application's web interface.
