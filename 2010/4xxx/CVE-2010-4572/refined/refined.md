  "CVE-2010-4572": {
    "description": "By inserting particular strings into certain URLs, it was\n  possible to inject both headers and content to any\n  browser.",
    "root_cause": "The `chart.cgi` script used `print \"Location:\"` instead of `$cgi->redirect` when redirecting. This allowed an attacker to inject arbitrary HTTP headers.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "HTTP Response Splitting",
      "Header Injection"
    ],
     "impact": "An attacker could inject arbitrary HTTP headers and content into a user's browser. This could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or other malicious activity.",
    "attack_vector": "By crafting a URL with specific malicious strings, an attacker could trigger the vulnerability in `chart.cgi`.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to craft a URL with the necessary malicious strings. No authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability, as it affects URL parameters.",
