Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a semicolon injection flaw in the `recorder_test.cgi` script of the D-Link DCS-2121 camera firmware.
- The `recorder_test.cgi` script uses the `system()` function to execute a command, specifically `smbmount`, with user-supplied parameters without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Semicolon Injection:** The `password` parameter in the `smbmount` command is not properly escaped, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands by using a semicolon (`;`).  For example, a password like `toto;/bin/true` would execute `smbmount ... -o username=...,password=toto` followed by the `/bin/true` command.
- **Hardcoded Root Password:** The root password for the device is hardcoded to "admin" in the `/etc/rc.d/rc.local` script.
- **Insecure `telnetd.cgi` Script:** The `telnetd.cgi` script allows enabling the telnet daemon on the device using a simple `on` or `off` command in the `command` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful semicolon injection allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands with root privileges on the device.
- **Full System Compromise:** Combined with the hardcoded root password and the ability to enable telnet, an attacker can gain full remote root access to the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The primary attack vector is through the web configuration interface of the D-Link DCS-2121 camera.
- **`recorder_test.cgi`:** Specifically, by manipulating the `password` parameter when making a request to `/cgi/admin/recorder_test.cgi`.
- **`telnetd.cgi`:** The telnet daemon can be enabled remotely through a request to `/cgi/admin/telnetd.cgi?command=on`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator on the web interface to exploit the semicolon injection via the `recorder_test.cgi` script.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the device to send requests to the CGI scripts.
- **Knowledge of the device's IP address:** The attacker needs to know the IP address of the camera to make the HTTP requests and telnet into the device.
- **Optional CSRF:** The vulnerability could be exploitable with CSRF, but that is not required for exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**

- The blog post author speculates that other D-Link products and possibly other embedded systems may have the same vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was a "0day" at the time of discovery and had not been reported to the vendor.
- A hardcoded root password ("admin") in `/etc/shadow` allows for easy telnet access once the service has been enabled.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to gain root access on the D-Link DCS-2121 camera via command injection and a hardcoded password.
