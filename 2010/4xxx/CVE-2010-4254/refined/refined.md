```
{
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Mono/Moonlight handles generic type arguments. Specifically, it does not properly validate the instantiation of generic methods, which allows for type confusion and memory corruption.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Type confusion",
    "Memory corruption",
     "Privilege escalation"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges, potentially compromising the affected application and the underlying computer.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local attackers can exploit the vulnerability by crafting malicious code that leverages the flaw in generic method instantiation.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A local attacker is required."
