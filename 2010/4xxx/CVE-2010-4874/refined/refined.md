Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2010-4874

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the failure of the `users.php` script in NinkoBB 1.3RC5 (and possibly earlier versions) to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the `msn`, `aim`, `first_name`, and `last_name` variables.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the vulnerable application.
*   Successful exploitation could lead to:
    *   Compromise of the application.
    *   Theft of cookie-based authentication credentials.
    *   Disclosure or modification of sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   An attacker can exploit this vulnerability using a web browser by submitting a crafted POST request to the `users.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No specific user privileges are mentioned in the exploit. The attacker doesn't need to be logged in, as the exploit can be triggered without being logged into the application, since the exploit can be performed on the profile page.

**Technical Details:**

The exploit uses a crafted HTML form that sends POST data to `users.php?a=profile`, where the `first_name`, `last_name`, `msn`, and `aim` input fields are populated with malicious JavaScript code wrapped in `<script>` tags. This code will be executed by the victim's browser upon viewing the profile page containing the unsanitized values.

```html
<form action="http://host/users.php?a=profile" method="post" />
<input type="hidden" name="first_name" value=""><script>alert('XSS1');</script>">
<input type="hidden" name="last_name" value=""><script>alert('XSS2');</script>">
<input type="hidden" name="msn" value=""><script>alert('XSS3');</script>">
<input type="hidden" name="aim" value=""><script>alert('XSS4');</script>">
<input type="submit" name="profile" value="submit">
</form>
```
